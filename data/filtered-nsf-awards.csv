"The ability to record events (“memory”) is a crucial part of many complex systems. Recording events allows these systems to modify their behavior based on previous interactions, report on their history, or communicate local information to a global community. Biological systems will benefit greatly from the creation of memory elements. Biological memories in bacterial or mammalian cells could be used to monitor a person’s microbiome, develop smart materials that respond to the environment, or create specialized sensors that react to biotoxins. Biological memories in living cells themselves require a controlled environment. This environment not only ensures their long-term survival and viability but also allows for the controlled reading and writing of the memory. Reading and writing will ultimately be how these systems are “programmed” and how the data they collect can be acted upon. This project creates novel bio-memories using devices that move small amounts of liquids (microfluidics). Microfluidics are used to test in parallel many biological-memory configurations to determine which are the best at testing specific environmental signals (e.g. toxins, metals, hormones). The best of these memories are then integrated with low-cost, embedded electronics that can read their outputs as well as control the microfluidic environments housing the memories and allowing external signals to “write” information in the memories. Biological memories, microfluidics, and electronics together form what is called “Hybrid Bio-Electronic Microfluidic Memory Arrays”. These devices will explore numerous interdisciplinary challenges and create opportunities for exploring applications at the boundaries of computer science, synthetic biology, and materials science.  To maximize this project’s impact, all of the research including the microfluidic and electronics designs and software will be made open source. All genetic memory elements will be provided to the scientific community. More than 48 undergraduate students will be mentored during the project period via NSF sponsored programs and summer research programs at Boston University. 

This project has a three-phase structure, where in the first phase biological memories are developed with the aid of a high-throughput, electronically augmented microfluidic screening platform. Recombinase enzymatic reactions on DNA will act as the irreversible memories while epigenetic, chromatin modifications will act as the reversible mechanism. This phase will involve the creation of 1000’s of potential memory elements. In the second phase, the top candidates from the first phase are combined in a massively parallel, highly integrated microfluidics platform to develop the eventual deployed microfluidic as well as establishing the operating and control conditions needed for the memories. Finally, in phase three, a small-scale deployment environment is created to observe and tune the performance of the newly created Hybrid Bio-Electronic Microfluidic Memory Arrays in an aquatic deployment scenario meant to replicate real-world bio-sensing applications for heavy metals and other environmental signals. These phases explicitly address three bio-memory challenges (create, control, and deploy) using state-of-the-art biological reversible and irreversible memories, droplet microfluidics, and customized embedded semiconductor-based electronics.

"The functional molecules in cells are proteins - the expression, activity and interactions of particular proteins in any given cell define its structure and what it is capable of doing. The technologies used to study proteins on a large scale are collectively called proteomics. The main method used in proteomics is mass spectrometry (MS), which can calculate the molecular weight and abundance of molecules. The majority of proteomics workflows perform a step of protein digestion prior to MS. The result of digestion is that all the proteins become broken up into small chains, called peptides. This step has become common, because peptides are easier to analyse by MS, due to their lower mass, producing simpler data to interpret. One challenge in this digestion step is that some proteins break down quickly whereas for others digestion is incomplete, producing unreliable quantification data that are not fully understood or compensated for by current analysis software. To overcome this problem, the University of Texas Anderson Cancer Center will collaborate with the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom to develop an integrated suite of analysis techniques using a powerful statistical technique called Bayesian modelling. These advances will be incorporated into a freely available software suite.
  
Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) coupled to Liquid Chromatography (LC) is the primary technique used in proteomics. The most common approach is LC separation of tryptic fragments derived from a proteome digestion, followed by tandem MS of the peptides. This entire workflow is conceived as a series of discrete steps, some chemical, some instrumental, some informatics and some statistical. Existing software concentrates on subcomponents of the workflow, and comprise a series of deterministic, self-contained steps. This project will translate the whole protein quantification pipeline into a rigorous statistical framework underpinned by Bayesian methodology. The new framework will integrate evidence across all experimentally acquired datasets, and borrow strength from unused structure within a proteomics workflow, including digestion dynamics. The proposed pipeline consists of three synergistic developments (1) Utilization of all unidentified (peptide) features, as well as identified features, to infer the most likely mixture of proteins present in a sample; (2) Differential quantification of complex mixtures of known proteoforms; (3) Discovery of unknown proteoforms and all modifications (PTMs) carried by their quantification signatures. These advancements will elicit a step-change in quantification sensitivity and interpretation at the proteoform level for the first time. The end-to-end analysis solution will be made available within the user-centric standards compliant ProteoSuite package, and as a Galaxy workflow for high-throughput pipelines.",NSF,University of Pennsylvania,PA,98079,2016487,jeffrey.morris@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,Jeffrey,Morris,0,02/25/2020,09/01/2019,08/31/2020,Bilateral BBSRC-NSF/BIO: Bayesian Quantitative Proteomics,"['Wilson KI, Godara P, Jasien JV, Zohner YE, Morris JS Girkin CA, Samuels BC, Downs JC~Intra-Subject Variability and Diurnal Cycle of Ocular Perfusion Pressure as Characterized by Continuous Telemetry in Nonhuman Primates.~Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science~61~2020~1~~10.1167/iovs.61.6.7~0~ ~0~ ~18/10/2021 13:15:34.486000000'

We treat these data as ""complex functional data"", a type of data increasingly encountered in many areas of biological and medical research.  The develop,ent of general rigorous methods for these data that can model the entire data set without discarding information contained in the rich data, while accounting for their complex internal structure, promises to make a strong impact in many areas of biomedical research, withthe key being the ability to uncover insights contained in the data that would have been missed by simplistic current analytical approaches.  

While motivated by and applied to protein data applications in which the protein expressions in a clinical sample are used to infer information about the patient's clinical response or undelrying biological processes, the methods have broad application in many other data types including but not limited to genomic data, wearable devices, imaging data, and climate data.  In this grant period, we have developed a suite of models, methods, and software to fit them and freely shared these with the broad research community.  Besides developing these tools, we have also applied them to reveal important insights into various types of cancers as well as glaucoma.  

This work has produced dozens of peer-reviewed publications in statistical, biological, and clinical journals as well as numerous talks at national and international conferences.

"Biologists are deluged with sequence data yet have derived comparatively little biological information from it. The accurate annotation of protein function is key to understanding life, but experimentally determining what each protein does is costly and difficult, and cannot scale up to accommodate the vast amount of sequence data already available. Therefore discovering protein protein function by computational, rather than experimental means, is of primary importance. Genomic sequence data are available from thousands of species,  and those are coupled with massive high-throughput experimental data. Together, these data have created new opportunities as well as challenges for computational function prediction. As a result, many computational annotation methods have been developed by research groups worldwide, but their accuracy and applicability need to be improved upon. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG) is to bring together computational biologists, experimental biologists and biocurators who are dealing with the important problem of predicting protein function, to share ideas, and create collaborations. To improve computational function prediction methods, the Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation algorithms (CAFA) was established as an ongoing experiment. CAFA was designed to provide a large-scale assessment of computational methods dedicated to predicting protein function. By challenging dozens of research groups worldwide to develop and provide their best software for function prediction, the researchers involved in the AFP-SIG will improve the ability of biologists to understand life at the molecular level. The AFP-SIG researchers will also generate experimental data from fruit-flies, fungi and bacteria to be used as benchmarks to test the software participating in CAFA, and a deeper understanding of these model organisms. 

It is now possible to collect data that comprehensively profile many different states of complex biological systems. Using these data it should be possible to understand and explain the underlying systems, but significant challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is that, as researchers collect more data from many different organisms in many different systems, they discover more and different genes. Assigning functions to these newly discovered genes represents a key step towards interpretation of high-throughput data. This leads to a critical need to assess the quality of the function prediction methods that researchers have developed in recent years. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG), founded in 2005, is to bring together bioinformaticians and biologists who are addressing this key challenge of gene function prediction. In addition to sharing ideas and creating collaboration, AFP-SIG has created CAFA: the Critical Assessment of (protein) Function Annotation. CAFA is a community-driven challenge to assess the performance of protein function prediction software, and it has been carried out twice since 2010.  The investigators will provide the following outcomes: (1) robust open-source software to be used in function prediction and assessment of function prediction methods, incorporated into the high-profile annotation pipelines of UniProt-GOA; (2) expansion of the AFP community by engaging bioinformaticians, biocurators and experimentalists, thereby improving the quality and relevance of function prediction methods; (3) large-scale experimental screens in Drosophila, Candida and Pseudomonas for novel associations of targeted functional terms with genes; (4) an expanded CAFA event, incorporating both the curated annotations from the literature and our own experimental screens, in the last two years of the project.

In order to speed up discovery, however, it is necessary to combine experimental science and computation. Methodologies for protein function prediction are therefore an important component to the bigger questions as only a small fraction of these macromolecules can be studied in depth experimentally, where for the vast majority of them we might only be able to predict their biological roles. As there had been many methods for protein function prediction, we proposed to establish an independent and authoritative assessment of these techniques so that the scientific community and general public are aware of the state of the art in the field and also to stimulate further discovery in the field. We have done this successfully and fortunately we can report that in the past five years there has been an improvement in the overall accuracy of function prediction methods. Depending on their application, they can be used to understand general trends about functionalities of newly sequenced organisms or to prioritize biological experiments and optimize resource allocation. As part of the independent evaluation, we have performed our own experiments and have assigned functional terms to more than 1000 proteins from three species, thus demonstrating the synergy between experiment and computation. This project has also developed methodologies and approaches that extend to general science, mostly machine learning and through machine learning to many other fields. We have proposed new methods for dealing with data from so-called open world domains, where molecular data belongs, which will have applications in diverse fields. We have also established novel distance functions that unify some known distances across different types of data.  We have held four scientific meetings with more than 500 delegates in total, providing a forum for exchange of ideas and also networking opportunities. Finally, we have trained new generation of graduate students with the ability to think critically and work independently in this and related fields. We have also trained undergraduate researchers, two of whom have been from HBCU's. Both of these individuals have later proceeded to go to the graduate school. Overall, we believe this project has been highly successful.

"This project intends to study the core enzymes that drive the production and breakdown of carbohydrates. These enzymes, called the carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes), are found in all living organisms and particularly in plants and plant-associated microbes. The complex carbohydrates found in plant cell walls are the most abundant, and renewable, organic material on Earth. If we had efficient systems to convert them to biomaterials and biofuels they would be attractive targets for bio-manufacturing projects. Important effects in the natural world are (i) the CAZymes produced by plant microbial pathogens cause plant cell wall breakdown leading to devastating crop loss ($5 billion in the United States and Canada each year) and (ii) bacteria in animal guts produce hundreds of CAZymes that digest the carbohydrates in the diet, some of which may have positive, and others toxic, consequences to the host. The research approach combines genomics and bioinformatics: the genome of a green algae will be sequenced and then bioinformatics tools will be used to carry out data analysis. This green algae is the common ancestor of all land plants, its genome compared to those of plants will show how evolution has modified core carbohydrate chemistry to meet changing environmental challenges. Bioengineering of these enzymes may well contribute to the development of a more sustainable and secure bioeconomy (e.g., bioenergy and agricultural industries) in the US, as part of the global Genomics market, whose value is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020. Students trained in the course of this project will be poised to become the next generation of scientists, able to exploit their understanding of comparative genome sequence analysis to create new understanding and novel applications. The educational and outreach objectives of this project are to engage students as active participants in the research activities, including data analysis, and to to train undergraduate students and K-12 Science teachers to understand the basics of genome sequencing and comparison methods, including hands-on skills. 


In the first Aim, new bioinformatics programs will be developed to allow in-depth CAZyme annotation with predicted biochemical activities. In the second Aim, the genomic context of CAZymes will be studied in microbial genomes and metagenomes of various ecological environments. Overall four computational tools will be developed, integrated, and delivered as a CAZyme bioinformatics web portal named dbCAN2. These free online tools will facilitate CAZyme research in various research fields such as genomics, carbohydrate, bioenergy, plant disease, food security, human gut microbiome, evolution and ecology. In the third Aim, this project will sequence and mine the genomes and transcriptomes of algae and early plants for CAZymes. This includes sequencing the genome and transcriptome of a green alga Zygnema circumcarinatum, the immediate ancestor of all land plants that is extremely critical for understanding the early evolution of carbohydrate-rich cell walls. The specific education activities include: (i) working with the Office of Student Engagement and Experiential Learning (OSEEL) of Northern Illinois University to bring undergraduate students, particularly under-represented minority students, into CAZyme bioinformatics research; (ii) collaborating with the Center for Secondary Science Teacher Education of NIU to integrate DNA sequencing and data analysis topics into the curriculum of the Teacher Licensure Program as well as the professional development programs for K-12 Science teachers; and (iii) incorporating Zygnema genome annotation as new lab components into BIOS308 (Genetics) and BIOS441 (Practical Bioinformatics).

"Biological collections in the United States have amassed over 500 million specimens but only 14% of these have been digitized; thus we need to greatly expand existing tools and methods to efficiently digitize specimen data. This project addresses this need by transforming Symbiota, one of the most widely used software platforms for mobilizing specimens in US research collections. Symbiota is an online biodiversity data management software platform that integrates data and images from networks of data providers. It has helped mobilize over 37 million specimen records from 766 natural history collections and is one of the most successful platforms for creating large collaborative data communities for sharing and displaying biodiversity data. Symbiota is used by 74% of the projects funded by the NSF Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and is thus a key platform to help digitize the estimated 430 million specimens in US collections that have yet to be digitized. Symbiota's success is largely due to its low learning curve and powerful set of tools for documenting species occurrences and integrating them with images and detailed taxonomic descriptions. But its widespread use has yielded significant feedback on how it could be made more effective. To accomplish this and aid its future development, Symbiota needs a fundamental restructuring. This project will transform Symbiota into a new version, Symbiota2, to catalyze contributions, expand research use, enrich education-outreach activities, and increase sustainability. Symbiota2 will enhance our ability to address a broad spectrum of biodiversity-related research questions by facilitating data visualization, linking multiple data sources (e.g., publications), creating better tools for data quality assessment, and monitoring data usage.

The transformation of Symbiota into Symbiota2 will completely refactor its code structure to emphasize modularity and improve usability and accessibility. This transformation will achieve the following goals, derived through direct management of Symbiota data portals and concerted and dedicated interactions with the Symbiota user community: 1) Provide RESTful web services so that data can be easily incorporated into a scientific workflow, 2) Build a plugin architecture to ease the development of new features, 3) Create a database abstraction layer to include a wide variety of backend database management systems, 4) Increase data utility by supporting analytical and visualization tools, 5) Separate the Graphical User Interface (GUI) from other processing so that new GUIs can be used, and 6) Enhance the data collection by making it easier to add new kinds of data and work offline. With these goals met, Symbiota2 will be a powerful biodiversity data management system fulfilling the needs of developers, data providers, researchers, and education professionals, as well as being interoperable with other biodiversity initiatives.

"Estimating the age of individuals based on skeletal elements can inform our understanding of human biocultural experiences, identities, and population dynamics across the history of our species. Methods that use information about dental development are particularly useful for juvenile age estimation. This doctoral dissertation research project examines the developmental relationships between teeth and how these relationships affect error rates in juvenile dental age estimation. A better understanding of human variation in dental correlations can improve both methods of age estimation for bioarchaeological and forensic research as well as clinical understanding of human growth and development. The project supports graduate training in STEM, the development of open-source dental age estimation software, and online training workshops for researchers and practitioners.  

In order to simplify mathematical modeling, it is often assumed that dental developmental traits are independent from one another after accounting for the effect of chronological age. The problem with this conditional independence assumption is that if conditional independence is not biologically valid, resulting age estimates will be biased and have error rates that are larger than expected. This is a problem in both bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology because biased age estimates can compromise our understanding of past populations and unknown age interval error rates do not meet the Daubert standard for expert testimony. These issues are addressed through three specific aims: 1) characterize the extent of correlations between developing teeth, 2) characterize the degree of variability of correlations between developing teeth, and 3) develop, validate, and test an open-source developmental age estimation program that incorporates the correlations between teeth. These aims are approached using Bayesian statistical models and cluster analysis in R. Models are fit to dental development scores of living children and validated using dental development scores from existing decedent databases in order to develop the age estimation software.

"The human species has been shaped by many biological and cultural processes, including the infectious diseases we have experienced over the millennia and our responses to those events. Given the ongoing threat of emerging infectious disease, understanding the ways in which humans and pathogens impacted one another in the past can inform infectious disease research in the present. This doctoral dissertation project examines the origins and evolution of the disease pathogen responsible for the deadliest form of human malaria (P. falciparum). This pathogen is thought to have evolved through the transfer of a gorilla parasite to humans, but the timing and anthropological context for this event and malaria’s subsequent global spread remain poorly understood. The project traces malaria’s evolutionary history through analysis of both ancient P. falciparum genomes and related great ape parasites. The project also generates new methods and tools that can be applied in other genomic research projects, fosters student training and international research collaborations, and generates new resources for public science education and outreach. 

The project is part of an international collaborative effort of geneticists and primatologists to reconstruct genomes from ancient Plasmodium falciparum and related great ape parasites. Using genomic analyses to estimate when P. falciparum first emerged as a human parasite, the co-PI and colleagues explore whether specific ecological and/or cultural factors, particularly the adoption or diversification of agriculture, may have favored this zoonotic event. Comparing ancient and modern parasite genomes, the investigators explore the timing and route of malaria’s global dissemination to understand the impact of human mobility on pathogen dispersal in the past. This project is anticipated to generate valuable, concrete resources for the broader scientific community, including genome-wide data from ancient Plasmodium falciparum and wild-living gorilla Plasmodium parasites.

"The goal of this project is to develop computer software that allows scientists to compare the genomes of natural populations of organisms. Population genomics (the study of diversity in the genomic DNA of populations instead of individuals) has important applications in agriculture, anthropology, conservation, medicine, and several other fields of biology. Recent technology advances have greatly lowered the cost of DNA sequencing so large amounts of data are available. At the same time statisticians have developed new methods for analyzing large collections of genome-sized data. Combining the data with the new analysis approaches can let scientists answer fundamental questions about the biology of species that have never before been accessible. However, most population genomics studies fail to take advantage of the latest population genomics statistical methods. This is because the genomic data requires a lot of processing to prepare it for the analysis steps, and these operations are not easy to learn. Lack of bioinformatics knowledge has led to erroneous conclusions, irreproducible results, incomplete analyses, and slow turnaround time of population genomics projects. This project aims to provide software that can handle those tasks in a consistent and correct way and allow direct access to the statistical tools, to bring about new insights in population biology. 

This project will address the largest impediments to model-based population genomics by building a user-friendly and intuitive pipeline platform, the ""Pop-gen Pipeline Platform"" (PPP). This platform will help researchers avoid the problems inherent in re-inventing data processing scripts to feed data into their population genomics analyses, and considerably reduce time and effort. PPP will include tested scripts and pipelines for data preparation, and in addition the tools needed to build evolutionary models, carry out analyses of data, and create visualization of results via the Ruffus Computation Pipeline Library in Python. PPP will also be developed as a stand-alone application with a graphical user interface (GUI) under the popular and robust Galaxy Project (www.galaxyproject.org) for bioinformatics analyses. An online server deploying Galaxy/PPP will be developed and maintained at Temple University, Philadelphia (www.dev3.cst.temple.edu) for users to interactively submit jobs on a first-come-first-served basis. Online forums will be established for support, and to collect suggestions regarding what is desired for further development under PPP. Tutorials and videos about example applications of the PPP will be added to the Galaxy Project Wikipedia training channels. Additionally, a significant part of this work will involve educating Temple University seniors, Philadelphia area high school teachers, and their students about the power of bioinformatics in modern biology through summer workshops.

"Interactions between microbes and plants or microbes and animals are common. In many cases, both parties benefit from these interactions to the extent that they are dependent on one another and over time their interaction becomes irreversible. This project will bring together researchers working with a range of investigatory tools (such as measuring nutrient exchange, signaling and chemical communication, genomic approach, and mathematical modeling) in a range of systems (including plants and mycorrizal fungi, fungus growing ants, cockroaches with endosymbiontic gut microbes, carnivorous pitcher plants) so that they can lay the groundwork for developing a model that predicts the point of no return: that point at which the individual species in the system lose the ability to function independent of their partner. By seeking connections across the diversity of these systems, we hope to better understand the factors that lead to the development of partner dependence.  A major outcome of the project will be the development of training programs at three levels. Outreach and training will be developed for students at Metro High School in Columbus. This diverse urban school serves as a magnet for talented high school students with an interested in STEM fields. Training activities will include summer research projects in affiliated labs. A training program for undergraduate and graduate students at Ohio State University, and hold two workshops, one for faculty and students at regional universities in Ohio and one for people from HBCUs and HSIs. 

This project will develop a Biology Integration Institute application that seeks to determine the factors that push microbial symbioses past the point of no return to partner dependence. Partner dependence, which occurs when a symbiont requires an association with a partner for successful reproduction, represents a major evolutionary transition. Symbioses are complex adaptive systems, in which patterns emerge from the interactions and responses among partners and interactions between the partnership and other organisms. The development of symbioses relies on communication below the level of the organism and is often driven by molecules and cellular responses within the partners, but the advantages of the association may relate to community and ecosystem interactions, and the processes by which the partners adapt and respond are governed by evolutionary forces. Understanding and predicting the patterns of dependence and other phenomena within and across taxa requires understanding the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of these systems. While this Design proposal is focused on process instead of products, we expect to produce synthetic papers that will make connections across scales and lay the groundwork for future theory development and work in empirical systems.

"The concept of resilience - the ability of any system to return to a previous state after a perturbation – provides an ideal opportunity to unite different scales of biological research.  The ever-increasing specialization of scientific research has made it challenging for researchers in different fields of biology to exchange ideas. The study of system resilience, however, is common to all biological fields of study.  The overarching objective of this project is to use the theme of resilience to bridge cellular, organismal, and community-level scales of biology by synthesizing the tools, concepts, and approaches used by the different research fields. They will be integrated through 1) collaborative research that includes undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, and faculty, 2) curricular enrichment, and 3) outreach to other institutions, non-profits, and industry. Conserved mechanisms of resilience identified through these activities will be applicable to engineer and manage biological systems in medical, agricultural, industrial, and natural contexts.

This project will challenge scientists to span disciplinary, taxonomic, methodological, and other divides in biology to build and apply a unified framework for biological resilience. Many fields of biology have described resilience in their systems of study, but rarely are there integrative efforts to search for common patterns and processes of resilience across temporal and spatial scales. The first step of the project is to examine how existing models and metrics of resilience are implemented across biological scales. The second step is to determine if there are common mechanisms across scales that allow biological systems to maintain resilience. The final step will be to identify how the basic science of biological resilience can be used to design and manage cellular, organismal, and ecological systems. These areas of resilience will be examined through interdepartmental seminars in biological resilience, a regional symposium on biological resilience, a new graduate module on biological resilience, and graduate research fellowships in biological resilience.  The investigators will carefully examine and refine the existing lexicon for biological resilience that can be widely adopted by other biologists and integrative biology research institutions.

"The well-being of humans and ecosystems relies on biodiversity on Earth. Diversity emerged because animals and plants use a fantastic variety of methods to survive in all forms of habitats. In the case of animals, survival depends crucially on their ability to move around. Most animals use fins in water, wings in air, and limbs on land. But these appendages have extraordinary morphological diversity and can be repurposed for novel functions such as using fins to walk and limbs to swim. This project will establish the Evolutionary Morphogenesis and Biodiversity (EMBody) Institute to drive discoveries on how appendages are formed and used in animals. Complex and poorly understood processes, ranging across levels of organization from molecules through cells to populations and in speed from milliseconds to hundreds of millions of years, drive the diversity of appendages. The EMBody Institute will use multi-disciplinary collaborations to produce novel techniques and tools to study the processes that shape animal appendages. Additionally, learning how animals move over diverse environments can lead to improvements in the design of robots used in disaster relief by land, sea, or air. Importantly, the Institute will foster a culture of inclusivity to broaden participation in research, education, and public engagement with science.

A central question in biology is how biodiversity on Earth emerged from the complex, multi-scale interactions of biological processes with the physical and chemical environment. The Evolutionary Morphogenesis and Biodiversity (EMBody) Institute will focus on animal locomotion and the remarkable diversity of propulsive appendages, essential for movement and survival in diverse habitats. This Design proposal aims to establish a collaborative community that integrates the multiple disciplines needed for propelling breakthroughs in understanding the evolution of morphogenesis in vertebrate appendages such as fins, limbs, and wings. Appendages develop through morphogenesis, a dynamical process that integrates genetic patterning with biochemical and mechanical regulation. Form enables function but does not dictate it. Rather, physical interactions with the environment, governed by mechanical principles and neural control, leads to function. Ultimately, natural selection operates on function, and the evolutionary transformation of ancestral gene regulatory networks yields novel forms and functions. From genes at the smallest level to selection on populations at the largest scale, this inextricable loop is the central theme of the EMBody Institute. The Institute will integrate experts from multiple disciplines and multiple levels of biological organization: (i) development that drives the emergence of diverse morphologies from shared gene networks through regulation, (ii) biomechanics that generates function by neural, musculoskeletal, and mechanical interactions, and (iii) evolution that transforms ancestral gene networks to yield novel morphology and function. The collaborative activities will generate and test novel hypotheses, innovative measurement methods, and unique datasets to benefit multiple scientific communities.

"Living cells are equipped with highly versatile built-in toolkits of DNA, RNA, and proteins for molecular communication, computing, storage, and sensing/actuation in response to environmental stimuli. Synthetic biology has been successful in developing engineered cells by harnessing the same biological toolkits with enhanced natural functions or new human-defined functions. These engineered cells can potentially serve as a biological frontend layer that naturally interfaces with the environment and acts as biosensors/actuators, molecular computing platforms, and molecular memory to provide revolutionary solutions for many global challenges such as environmental monitoring, and healthcare. In parallel, with decades of technological advances, semiconductor technologies, e.g., Complementary-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits (ICs), are being widely employed as a semiconductor backend layer to achieve various integration, communication, and computation capabilities. This project investigates the development of a hybrid programmable nano-bioelectronic system as a first proof-of-concept demonstration that harnesses both the exquisite synthetic functionalities of engineered bacteria as the ""biological frontend"" and the full functionalities of the ultra-low-power CMOS integrated circuit chips as the ""semiconductor backend."" The target application of such a system includes in-field biological sensor for environment monitoring. The project has potentials for long-term broader impacts on basic science, education, and technology. It brings expertise from synthetic biology, hybrid bioelectronics, integrated circuits/packaging, information theory, and computing. The project directly addresses three research themes of the solicitation: Theme-1, biomolecular memory and computation; Theme 2, interface of biology and semiconductors; Theme-4, hybrid semiconductor-biological microelectronic systems. It seeks to foster collaborations between industry and academia and hence facilitates technology transfer. The team of investigators will train graduate and undergraduate students at Georgia Tech and MIT, including minority and under-represented students. The project will also emphasize K-12 outreach to promote education of local minority high school students. In particular, the research team will recruit high school teacher interns to enhance their curricula and organize lab tours for K-12 students. The research results will be disseminated through high-impact journals, premier conferences, websites, and social media, and will be integrated into multiple related courses at Georgia Tech and MIT.

The project aims to advance the science in multiple fronts and develop an integrated hybrid programmable nano-bioelectronic system. In such a system, a variety of bacteria strains are engineered as sensing, storage, and computation biological frontends to (1) perform wide-spectrum chemical sensing, e.g., heavy metal detections for environmental monitoring, (2) provide in-bacteria DNA-based storage of analog/digital information, (3) execute molecular computation via stochastic computing and encode the signal for the DNA storage, and (4) support ""variable gain"" reprogramming of bacteria sensors by external optical and electrical stimuli. As the integrated semiconductor electronics backend, CMOS IC chips with on-chip pixelated massively paralleled arrays will be developed to provide two-way multi-modal interfaces with the bacteria frontends, i.e., for reading stored sensory information from the bacteria and writing control signals to reprogram the bacteria sensors. The bacteria strains and CMOS ICs will be integrated together in 3D-printed microfluidics structures and packages with separate chambers. The proposed components and systems will be demonstrated through in vitro experiments using the resources at Georgia Tech and MIT.

"Analyzing single neuron's property is a fundamental task to understand the nervous system and brain working mechanism. Investigating neuron morphology is an effective way to analyze neurons, since it plays a major role in determining neurons' properties. Recently, the ever-increasing neuron databases have greatly facilitated the research of neuron morphology. However, the sheer volume and complexity of these data pose significant challenges for computational analysis, preventing the realization of the full potential of such data. This interdisciplinary project will seek for new avenue to assemble the massive neuron morphologies and provide a unified framework for neuroscientists to explore and analyze different types of neurons. The research is able to tackle many challenges in neuroscience which are hard to solve with previous methods, including fine-grained neuron identification, latent pattern discovery and exploration, etc. The large-scale methods being developed will be particularly beneficial in the future of neuroscience, since more and more neurons are reconstructed and added to the databases. The computational methods and tools developed are very likely to be applicable for solving other bioinformatics problems, especially those dealing with large-scale datasets. The broader impact of this project not only includes educational support for undergraduate researchers and high school students, particularly women and those underrepresented groups, but also contributes to the research of neuroscience and other STEM fields.

The long-term goal of this project is to develop effective computational methods and tools for neuroscientists to interactively explore large-scale neuron databases with ultra-fine-grained accuracy, in real-time. This research has a strong multidisciplinary component that involves a nexus ideas from machine learning, information retrieval, and neuroinformatics. Particularly, novel ideas will be implemented in three inter-related components through the whole framework. The first one addresses the accurate and efficient neuron reconstruction and tracing based on deep learning models. The second addresses the efficient discovery of relevant instances among large-size neuron databases via multi-modal and online binary coding methods. The third part addresses intelligent visualization and interaction schemes for knowledge discovery and mining, equipped with interactive coding that can incorporate domain experts' feedback to enhance the query algorithms for fine-tuned results. Compared with previous methods and systems, this project will open a new avenue to assist neuroscientists analyzing and exploring large-scale neuron databases with high efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. The performance of proposed methods will be validated using public neuro-morphological databases (e.g., NeuroMorpho, BigNeuron) and compared with several benchmarks. The effectiveness of the tools to be developed will be evaluated by neuroscientists on domain-specific hypothesis-driven applications.

This project studies neuron tracing, also known as neuron reconstruction, which aims at building 3D morphological structures of neurons from imaging data, such as laser scanning microscopy images. A major challenge is that laser scanning microscopy images usually have low signal-to-noise ratio and may contain discontinued segments of neurite patterns, making it challenging to perform tracing directly from raw microscopy images. This raises the need of an effective and automatic denoising algorithm to reduce the effect of noise and discontinued segments. In this project, we developed a set of novel deep learning methods for improving the performance of 3D neuron reconstruction from microscopy images. We treat the de-noising problem as an image transformation task in which deep models transform an input image into an output image. The models are trained to determine which voxels in 3D microscopy images belong to neurons. We developed both supervised and self-supervised deep learning methods for denoising images. We used imaging datasets from the BigNeuron project and other biological and natural images to evaluate our methods. Results show that our methods outperform prior methods and lead to improved performance on downstream tasks. Multiple high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students have been trained throughout this project.

"Skeletal remains are important sources of information on temporal trends in human health. Porous cranial lesions (PCLs) are interpreted as indicators of nutrient deficiencies and chronic infections and are among the most common pathological findings in human skeletal remains. This doctoral dissertation project uses methods previously applied primarily in archaeological contexts to investigating the causes of PCLs and the health of individuals who live with them. Specifically, the researchers will use an archaeological reference sample to develop computed tomography (CT) criteria for identifying PCLs in living individuals. They will then link measures of individual health to PCL findings from existing CT scans of a living population. Protocols and tools developed for PCL analysis will be made freely available online. The project will strengthen institutional capacity for future research collaborations and support STEM student training at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Because PCLs are developed during childhood, the methods developed in this proposal will have implications for public health across the lifespan. 

PCLs in archaeological samples have been interpreted as evidence of both stress and resilience. This project attempts to resolve this ambiguity by leveraging existing data drawn from a living population to test the association of PCLs in the orbits (cribra orbitalia) and the cranial vault (porotic hyperostosis) with known health profiles. First, the researchers will develop a protocol to extend archaeological methods to determining the prevalence of PCLs in a living population. Specifically, investigators will employ both visual assessments of CT scans and machine learning to reliably identify the presence and extent of PCLs on cranial CT scans using a reference sample of archaeological crania (n = 600). Once developed, investigators will apply the protocol to identify PCLs on existing cranial CTs of 1,310 living adults with known health profiles. This will link childhood development of PCLs to measures of later life health, including biological markers, medical diagnoses, and self-reported wellness. Finally, this project tests the common interpretation of PCLs as indicators of childhood anemia. Using biological markers from dried blood spot samples from children in the same population of living individuals (n = 480), investigators will identify the underlying causes of individual anemia cases and test their association with a biological marker of active bone remodeling.

These lesions are commonly reported by archaeologists as skeletal indicators of childhood stress, who attribute them to either infectious or nutritional causes in early life.

We first tested the sensitivity and accuracy of clinical computed tomography scans for identifying cranial lesions in living people by scanning archaeological crania with a range of lesion presentations. We found that moderate to severe cases of cranial porosity could be reliably documented from CT scans using settings intended to diagnose cranial fractures.  

We then evaluated existing head scans of adults aged 40+ years from the Tsimane population of Bolivia for cranial lesions presumably developed in early childhood. Using twenty years of health data from the Tsimane Health and Life History Project, we investigated the relationship between 1) cranial lesions and childhood health and 2) cranial lesions and morbidity in later life.

We found that cranial lesions were not associated with other measures of childhood illness or growth disruption (memories of childhood sickness; leg length relative to total height). However, we do find that shared childhood household is an independent predictor of lesion status, supporting the idea that childhood environment plays a role in the development of these skeletal lesions.

There is some evidence that cribra orbitalia is associated with immunocompromise in Tsimane adults, suggesting lifelong health consequences of lesion-causing processes in early life. Cribra orbitalia is associated with lower measures for some markers of adaptive immunity (fewer B cells, na?ve CD4+ T cells, and a lower ratio of total CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells) and with a greater risk of developing active tuberculosis. Cribra cranii, on the other hand, predicts double the risk of headaches but is not associated with notable differences in physiological measures.

We also assayed dried blood spots from Tsimane children for measures of iron deficiency (serum transferrin receptor), inflammation (C-reactive protein), and skeletal activity (osteocalcin) to investigate relationships between nutrient deficiency, infection, and processes of skeletal change during childhood. At the time of writing analyses are still underway, but initial explorations show a negative relationship between iron levels and skeletal activity, perhaps suggesting that childhood anemia, a known cause of cranial changes, is not the predominant cause of porous cranial lesions in this population.

"Humans evolved very large brains relative to their body size, with a remarkable enrichment of neurons in the cerebral cortex. Extensive efforts in anthropology have focused on delineating the adaptive pressures that led to these changes during human evolution. However, the genetic changes underlying human brain expansion have not been fully explored. This project will test hypotheses about human brain evolution by studying the impact of human genetic variation on brain development using experimental models. This research has broad implications for understanding what makes the human brain unique at the cellular and molecular levels, with translational value for medical treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. During this research, undergraduate students pursuing careers in STEM will be mentored and trained in molecular biology and bioinformatics techniques in the laboratory. Research findings will be used as 1) an educational tool for spreading knowledge about human evolution and genetics with the general public, K-12 students, and undergraduate students, as well as 2) a motivational platform for the young, future women scientists in the Females Excelling More in Mathematics, Engineering and Science (FEMMES) Program. 

The proposed research takes a multi-disciplinary approach to investigate how human evolutionary history has shaped the molecular and physiological mechanisms of human brain expansion. In the laboratory, human and non-human primate neural cells will be studied to explore how genetic variation evolved in humans to shape the developing brain. This project uses a combination of gene editing, RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry to determine the functional role of human-specific genetic sequence during brain development that corresponds to changes in brain size. These findings will advance the understanding of the molecular evolution of the human brain.

Research in anthropology has helped delineate the adaptive pressures on brain expansion during our evolution. However, the genetics underlying human brain expansion, favored by natural selection, have not been well-explored. Prime candidates for the evolution of human brain expansion are genes that are unique to humans, disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders, and expressed in neural progenitor cells (NPCs)?the cells that build the brain by determining the number of neurons. In this study, we investigate the function of candidate NBPF genes, which have expanded in number in primate genomes and exceptionally in the human genome (Figure 1). This project experimentally tests hypotheses about human molecular origins by investigating the impact of human-specific genes on the development of the human cerebral cortex as well as establish a functional model for studying brain evolution. 

            Human and chimpanzee in vitro brain organoids?3D structures differentiated from stem cells that mimic in vivo brains?provide an unprecedented opportunity to generate functional data on how human-specific genetic changes shape the developing brain. Here, we used a two-step strategy to investigate the genetics of human cortical expansion: 1) gene editing to evaluate the effect of rapidly evolved human-specific genes in human brain organoids, and 2) genetic introduction of human genes into chimpanzee organoids to identify developmental mechanisms that determine cortex size.

            Expression of NBPF proteins has changed throughout primate evolution, resulting in novel expression of human NBPF proteins in NPCs. In this study, we found that NBPF proteins localize to the cytoplasm in human NPCs and show peak expression at microtubules during cell division (Figure 2). Compared to human NPCs, chimpanzee NPCs express very low levels of NBPF protein. We found evidence that NBPF proteins interact with each other, as well as other proteins that are important for cytoskeleton dynamics and communication with the extracellular matrix in human NPCs (Figure 3). Disruption to these aspects of cell biology during brain development can lead to clinical microcephaly (abnormally small brain). 

            Dynamic balance between NPC proliferation and differentiation informs neuronal identity and number. To investigate the role of human-specific NBPF in brain development, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing to deplete the expression of NBPF protein in NPCs. Using human brain organoid models, we observed a significant decrease in the number of proliferating cells, resulting in smaller organoids (Figure 4). In addition, NPCs in NBPF-depleted organoids started to differentiate to neurons earlier than control organoids, which acts to reduce the number of total neurons. Altogether, our findings support the hypothesis that NBPFs in human brain development influence NPC activity that is important to build a human brain. 

            Findings from this work have important implications for addressing interdisciplinary questions about human brain evolution as well as the role of NBPF proteins in neurodevelopmental disorders. This project has offered great opportunities for science communication and outreach locally and nationally, as well as mentorship and training.

"Humans have unique upright body posture and related anatomy, but paleontologists are not certain when these features first appeared in the hominin lineage. The aim of this doctoral research project is to functionally describe the anatomy of the primate neck to understand how differences in the neck are related to head posture, body posture, and locomotion in primates. The project will provide data that may be used for inferring when a human-like neck first appeared and how this anatomical change was associated with environmental, behavioral and biological factors. This study will employ a combination of 3D anatomical methods including CT scanning, digital muscle fascicle tracking, and biomechanical modeling, which will serve as training tools for future researchers and health care professionals. The 3D models generated in this study will be used in K-12 science education and outreach events for discussing human anatomy and primate conservation.

The objective of this study is to both characterize and quantify neck muscle anatomy in primates with different habitual body postures and locomotor behaviors. Using a biomechanical framework, the project will compare functional differences in neck musculature that are key for behaviors such as holding up the head and movement of the arms during suspension. Novel techniques including contrast-enhanced computed tomography, muscle fascicle tracking software, and 3D lever mechanics will be used to develop biomechanical models of how variation in muscle size, shape, and distribution is related to postural and locomotor behavior across primates. These biomechanical models will be applied to fossil hominins (Australopithecus sediba and Homo neanderthalensis) to interpret their neck anatomy and posture to more accurately understand and reconstruct their behaviors.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Missouri-Columbia,MO,8576,1919475,wardcv@missouri.edu,Carol,Ward,1,08/04/2019,08/15/2019,05/31/2022,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Functional myology of the primate head and neck with implications for hominin evolution,,"This project sought to understand the evolution of our own species through the lens of function in the musculoskeletal system. The ways in which the individual bones and muscles are arranged both internally and externally, can help us understand their function. The neck is a complex structure in that it supports the head, helps an organism navigate through its environment, and participates in feeding and swallowing. Primates are noted for diversity in locomotor behaviors, diet, as well as large brains relative to body size. As such, the head, neck, and musculature that spans between them can be potentially tied to any or all these functions.

While we know that species such as Australopithecus afarensis, which includes ?Lucy,? were bipedal, we still do not understand how their head was positioned relative to their trunk (i.e., neck posture) nor how much time they may have spent in trees. Further, we know that the ?Lucy? species was likely not the first upright biped in our lineage. In fossil human ancestors, the shape and size of the bones of the nuchal plane and cervical vertebrae (back of the head and neck) are thought to be a functional complex that helps balance and support of the head, rotates the neck, and serves as an anchor point to muscles involved in forelimb suspension. In particular, the position and the orientation of the foramen magnum and nuchal plane (parts of the cranium) and anatomy of the cervical vertebrae (neck bones), are used to make inferences about our own lineage and when and in what species upright posture and bipedal locomotion first appeared. Yet, no study to date has been able to quantify and understand how these muscles and bones work together to facilitate postural and locomotor behaviors. The goal of this study was to bridge our gap in knowledge on this subject using a variety of innovative techniques to understand how the neck works in our closest living relatives? the extant primates?before applying our knowledge to extinct species like our own fossil ancestors.

To understand how the nuchal muscles work across primates, this study used traditional dissection methods, contrast enhanced MicroCT scanning, as well as 3D lever mechanics to assess functional hypotheses. We sought to answer how postural and locomotor behaviors affect the size, shape and attachment sites of the muscles that span the back of the head and neck in a sample of primate cadavers. Specifically, this study was able to develop and apply new methods of semi-automatic muscle fascicle tracking, which allows for relatively non-invasive ways of quantifying muscle fascicle orientation, length, and number which are components of muscle function.

Results demonstrate that the shape and inferred function of the nuchal muscles do not reflect postural and locomotor behaviors as strongly as previously thought. There are a few exceptions to this finding. The first is that primates that have upright postures, like humans, demonstrate reduced force generation in a small muscle that extend the head and neck (longissimus capitis) compared to primates that have horizontal trunk postures. Second, primates that engage in vertical-clinging and leaping, like sifaka lemurs and the tarsier, may have modified neck muscles that allow them to rotate their head and neck more readily. Further, suspensory and semisuspensory behaviors (i.e., hanging from the arms) may influence the attachment size and orientation of the trapezius muscle in some primates, but this may not necessarily translate to an overall more powerful trapezius muscle.

Combined, these findings suggest that there may be more variables at play in determining the function nuchal musculature. More research is required to understand how the size and shape of the face and head, which house vital organs like the brain, affect the size and shape of the posterior neck muscles before making claims about how early human ancestors used their necks to interact with their environments.

"Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Treponema pallidum subp. pallidum bacteria. It has recently reemerged as an urgent worldwide health crisis. The origin of the disease has been a mystery since its sudden appearance in Europe at the end of the 15th century and its subsequent rapid global spread. It has long been debated whether syphilis was introduced to Europe, perhaps from the Americas, or evolved from a form of treponemal infection that had been in Europe all along.  Graduate student Ziyu Wang and collaborators at The Pennsylvania State University will take a multi-faceted approach to investigate the pathogen's genetic diversity over the past 500 years in Europe to explore several possibilities to explain syphilis' origin in Europe. The current T. pallidum pathogens - associated with several related diseases - likely represent only the most successful or recently emerged genetic variants. Examined through an anthropological lens, ancient genomes when considered within the context of human sociocultural systems yield clues about the processes through which pathogens have achieved their evolutionary success. Ultimately a more informed understanding of the factors that contribute to the complex and dynamic interactions between humans and their pathogens provides a deep-time foundation for predicting the evolutionary trajectories of modern infectious pathogens and human responses. Today, as in the past, STI-related stigma has done much to interfere with the development and implementation of effective intervention programs. Lessons learned from historic epidemics and the public response will provide valuable tools for training healthcare professionals, STI high-risk groups, and the public.

To untangle syphilis' origin, its evolution, and its worldwide spread, the research team will sequence T. pallidum genomes from representative specimens sampled from temporally and socially well-characterized European skeletal assemblages dating to the 16th to 19th centuries. Ancient T. pallidum has previously not been well studied because of the limited ability of conventional genetic techniques (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) to recover highly-degraded ancient pathogen DNA. Here a sensitive targeted hybridization capture technique will be used to recover complete, or near-complete, ancient T. pallidum genomes. By comparing temporally known ancient pathogen genomes with their modern equivalents, the research team can track the sequential changes that occurred in the pathogen's genetic history. Doing so will narrow the possible evolutionary scenarios for the origin of syphilis and point to when the pathogen variant that causes syphilis first emerged.

As a disease of great historical importance, the geographic origin of syphilis, in connection with its first recorded epidemic in Europe in 1495, has been at the center of a centuries-long debate. This was because the outbreak occurred at the beginning of a significant bidirectional exchange of humans, plants, animals, and microbes across the Atlantic. For centuries, the ""Columbian hypothesis"" claims that Columbus's crew introduced syphilis, a previously unknown disease, to Europe upon their return from the Americas in 1493. Alternatively, the pre-Columbian hypothesis argues that syphilis existed in Europe prior to Columbus. There are two nuanced views here, although both of them suggest an African origin for the disease. The first one, the Alternative hypothesis, pointed to the pathogen’s natural reservoirs found in wild non-human primates (NHPs) as a possible source, with the disease introduced to continental Europe through the slave trade prior to 1495. The second perspective (the Unitarian hypothesis) argues that the T. pallidum pathogen is ubiquitous around the globe. The pathogen spread with early Paleolithic human migrations out of Africa. Currently scientific data supporting these various narratives are limited. 

With 20th century medical knowledge, we now know that the precise causative agent of syphilis, TPA, is closely related to other T. pallidum subspecies of pertenue (TPE) and endemicum (TEN) that cause the endemic disease forms of yaws and bejel, respectively. These three diseases are collectively known as the human treponematoses. The pathogen subspecies of each disease form is morphologically and physiologically indistinguishable by microscopy or by serological tests of host antibodies. Healthcare professionals have to predominantly base their diagnoses on a careful consideration of clinical characteristics. However, the clinical manifestations of each disease form are highly variable, yet are strikingly similar to one another. Because of the overlap in clinical signs, diagnosis accuracy is frequently questioned, especially in regions where multiple treponematoses occur. Currently the precise identification of disease form by its responsible pathogen subspecies is only by molecular methods. 

Exactly which and how many forms of treponemal infection existed in Europe is currently unclear in historical documents and the archaeological record. Because syphilis is customarily known to be the only form of treponematosis that transmits sexually, it has been assumed that the bacterium responsible for the 1495 European epidemic is the same as, or has evolved into, TPA, the causative agent of modern syphilis. Although there are, at present, only a few such sequences, further work promises to clarify the evolutionary history of the treponemal diseases through a combination of ‘lost"" ancient T. pallidum genomes and paleopathological evidence.

To retrieve historical European T. pallidum genomes, we identified skeletal individuals with bony lesions consistent with the treponematoses in three large and well-characterized Danish archaeological skeletal assemblages: 1) Lindegarden, Ribe; (n=215; AD 1427-1805); 2) Gr&aring;br&oslash;dre, Svendborg (n=200; AD 1500-1600); and 3) Klosterkirken, Horsens (n= 221; AD 1750-1856). For a multi-stage paleogenomic study, we sampled teeth from individuals (&ge;15 years old) with (n=39) and without (n=11) skeletal lesions suggestive of treponemal infection. First, we screened metagenomic/shotgun sequences recovered from the teeth of these 50 individuals for genetic signatures of T. pallidum. Then, for 18 samples identified with putative T. pallidum DNA, we used a targeted whole genomic hybridization capture approach to enrich for T. pallidum DNA fragments prior to another round of sequencing. A novel ancient T. pallidum draft genome was identified in individual AG51 from the Gr&aring;br&oslash;dre cemetery in Svendborg, along with 17 samples of low-genome coverage. This newly reconstructed Danish ancient T. pallidum genome is phylogenetically placed within the TPE lineage. This indicates that TPE was an agent of treponematosis that existed in the once-living Danish community. This novel Danish TPE genome is closely related to all historical TPE genomes recovered from human remains dated to the 16th to 18th centuries. Our finding, when added to a growing body of ancient T. pallidum genomics evidence from the early modern Europe, suggests that the documented European ""syphilis"" epidemics starting in 1495, along with its subsequent global spread, might have been causes by multiple T. pallidum lineages, not just TPA. Drawing from multidisciplinary perspectives, we further suggest a complex evolutionary process of T. pallidum with a possible early origin from Africa and multiple dispersion events facilitated by human population movements throughout history.

"Scalp hair in the absence of body hair is a uniquely human trait, whose evolutionary significance is not well understood. This doctoral dissertation project will develop a digital tool for the quantitative measurement of hair fiber morphology, to investigate the underlying genetic architecture of hair morphology across human groups, and experimentally test the function of scalp hair as a barrier to solar heat gain. The methods developed as part of this project will advance our understanding of human adaptive traits and also inform forensic and dermatological research. Data collected for this project will increase the representation of understudied groups in research. This project will provide valuable research opportunities for undergraduates from groups underrepresented in STEM research fields and will generate materials for teaching about human biological diversity in a non-racial paradigm.

Human hair morphology varies on a continuous spectrum from straight to tightly curled; however, research in genetics, dermatology, and forensics incudes a range of descriptors that can be qualitative (e.g. wavy, frizzy) and racial (e.g. 'Caucasian hair,' 'African-type hair'). By developing a method to quantify hair morphology and studying the genetic variation in a diverse group of African Americans, this study leverages genetic admixture as a means of elucidating genotypes underlying hair morphology across human groups. The experimental work in this project will test the hypothesis that human scalp hair morphology evolved in early Homo as a protective mechanism against heat gain from solar radiation. This project will additionally carry out a series of tests of selection on candidate loci (previously associated with hair morphology or hair follicle development) to test whether there is evidence of selection in hair-related genes that would support a thermoregulatory explanation for the evolution of human scalp hair.

However, Lasisi is using her newly developed hair phenotyping methods to analyze previously collected hair samples and plans to push this research forward as sampling becomes feasible again. Preliminary results on the potential for discovering new hair-related genetic loci are presented in the methods paper (here). 
Lastly, Lasisi carried out a novel experimental study on the effect of scalp hair morphology on heat transfer. Her results demonstrated that the presence of scalp hair significantly reduces heat gained from solar radiation and that tightly curled hair, in particular, minimizes heat gain from solar radiation. 
Results discussed in this report can be found in Lasisi’s doctoral dissertation which is freely available (here).  
 
The research funded by this grant has allowed Lasisi to produce novel research on an aspect of human biological variation that has historically been racialized and that remains poorly understood. This work has formed the basis of many of Lasisi’s science communication efforts and she continues to share her research and knowledge of human evolutionary biology through various public and social media outlets.

"Old Dominion University is awarded an Early Faculty Career Development grant to support Dr Shuiwang Ji in research leading to a better understanding of the brain. The brain is an enormously complex system, and the analysis of brain data is thus an equally enormous challenge. Human brains contain billions of neurons and trillions of synapses (junctions); and each of them is unique in their basic biochemistry, functions, and dynamics. The brain is also a multi-level system organized across different spatial scales, ranging from genes, synapses, and cells to circuits, brain regions, and systems. Today, brain science is experiencing rapid changes and is expected to achieve major advances in the near future. Recent technological innovations are enabling scientists to capture the gene expression patterns, connectivity, and neuronal activities at increasing speed and resolution. This is generating a deluge of data that capture the brain activities at different levels of organization. To attack the central challenges of analyzing these new data, this project will develop a class of efficient, integrative, multidimensional, predictive, and correlative techniques and use them to analyze large-scale, high-resolution, and multi-modality sets of brain data. Specifically, this project will develop analytics tools to predict the cellular-resolution, brain-wide connectome (""wiring diagram"") from genetic transcriptional profiles. This analysis will elucidate the information pathway from genes to connectivity and ultimately, to function. This project will also integrate other brain dimensions by performing multidimensional network correlative analytics. In addition, this project will address the relationship between gene expression, cell types, and brain structures. The success of this project will be a new class of efficient, robust analytics methods that are flexible enough to be adapted for integrating, modeling, and mining current and future brain data.

The results of this project will have an immediate and strong impact on multiple disciplines, including brain data analytics and computational neuroscience, biological image informatics, and big data analytics. A future long term goal is to uncover basic underlying differences between normal and impaired brain functions. The unified treatment of brain data analytics will be readily transformable into new courses for training next-generation computational biologists. The multidisciplinary nature of this project provides unique opportunities for integrating its components into existing curricula. Brain science has been shown to be a valuable resource for inspiring scientific interests in K-12 students. Components of the project will be integrated into an existing high-school student internship program, thereby inspiring future science students. Underrepresented students will be especially encouraged to participate throughout the project. The results of this project will be disseminated in the form of peer-reviewed publications, open-source software, tutorials, seminars, and workshops.

The human brain contains billions of neurons and trillions of synapses; and each of them is unique in their fundamental biochemistry, functions, and dynamics. The brain is also a multi-level system organized across different spatial scales, ranging from genes, synapses, and cells to circuits, brain regions, and systems. To attack the central challenges of brain data analytics, I developed a class of efficient, integrative, multidimensional, predictive, and correlative techniques and use them to analyze large-scale, high-resolution, and multi-modality brain data. I performed predictive analytics in which the cellular-resolution, brain-wide connectome is predicted from genetic transcriptional profiles. This analysis elucidates the information pathway from genes to connectivity and ultimately, to function. Secondly, I integrated other brain dimensions by performing multidimensional network correlative analytics. This type of analysis is based on a new class of probability distributions defined on multidimensional data arrays. My third initiative addressed the relationship between gene expression, cell types, and brain structures. All of the novel analytics methods in this project is based on a common foundation of the sparsity learning paradigm, which was originally motivated by neuronal information processing mechanisms. Overall, I developed three novel and significant advances in the scientific field of computational brain data analytics. Each advance dramatically extended current analytics techniques towards understanding multi-level, complex brain systems. Altogether, I developed a unified approach to deciphering the brain structure and function and provide a systematic framework for developing the methodologies to implement them. Multiple high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students have been trained throughout this project.

"The science of forecasting where a species can live and how it responds to climate change is still in its infancy. A species' geographic range is the map of where a species can be found. It is fundamental to understanding species' ecology and evolution and increasingly plays a vital role in conservation. Collections of species ranges covering most of the 30,000 terrestrial vertebrate species are already available for scientific analysis. However, collections of species ranges from the other ~95% of species on the planet are rare. The time is ripe to change this. New access to vast quantities of data from biological inventories, museums, citizen science, and previously funded studies mean that adequate data are available to estimate the ranges of many more species. However, we are currently missing robust forecasting methods and the computational tools to produce large numbers of ranges. This project will develop the novel computational methods and algorithms needed to forecast the current state and future fate of the many thousands of poorly studied species ranges. These methods will be applied to forecast how 100,000+ plant species in the New World will respond to climate change. The researchers will test key assumptions in conservation biology about how species respond to changing climate and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots across North and South America have/will change over time.  The end result of their work will be a novel tool for the ecological community that has tremendous potential to guide biological sampling strategies, particularly in conservation and citizen science applications. 

The proposed research will examine whether biodiversity hotspots are constant through time and whether species climatic niches are phylogenetically conserved, two implicit assumptions with wide-reaching implications in conservation biology and basic ecology. This research will develop a workflow to predict species ranges for any taxonomic group using by combining occurrence data with GIS data. This workflow will be applied to all New World plants to study basic questions, such as how species richness varies across space and time (a topic studied almost exclusively in vertebrates and trees). Computationally, the project will address core challenges in data scrubbing, niche modeling practices, novel niche modeling methods, and mega-phylogeny analysis methods.  A freely available generic pipeline will be capable of linking biodiversity occurrence data to species ranges and scaling these computations to 1000s or 100,000s of species. This integrated pipeline will be implemented by: 1) appropriately scrubbing data to remove taxonomic and geographic errors, 2) identifying clear best practice methods for range modeling applicable across diverse species, 3) innovating range modeling methods that integrate diverse data such as presence only museum collections and abundance-based plot data 4) scaling computationally-intensive range modeling in an HPC environment, and 5) placing the outputs of the products in a phylogenetic context. This project will develop such a pipeline using a novel database of 20,000,000 observations of 100,000+ species of plants in the New World. The range forecasts produced will be used to test key assumptions in conservation biology about the phylogenetic conservatism of species climatic niches and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots over time. This research will make substantial contributions to scientific infrastructure through the development of a scientific codebase for the production of high-quality species ranges from primary biodiversity data.

The initial efforts in this project were to: 1) improve the largest database to date recording every scientific observation of a plant species available electronically. It eventually grew to have over 100,000,000 observations of plants with well over 100,000 species worldwide. 2) To use these observations to generate maps of species ranges, the areas where a species lives. A key focus in the first step was to scrub or clean the data. As you might imagine data collected by 1000s of scientists stored in hundreds of institutions is not particular standardized nor is it usually usually inspected for errors. But doing good science requires accurate information.  All of this data and the tools we developed are shared openly and freely with the scientific community to enhance their productivity in other biodiversity informatics endeavors (e.g. other groups of species). 

One key result from this work was discovering just how numerous rare species are. It has always been known that it was a rather common state to be rare (there are many more rare species than widely spread abundant species). But we were surprised just how many rare species there are among plants globally (almost 37% are extremely rare). There are more rare species than any existing theory predicted. We also mapped areas of the world known as hotspots that have a high number of rare species.  These areas become important targets for efforts to protect more land (e.g. by creating new national parks). In identifying these areas we also found that these areas are among some of the areas most impacted by humans and climate change, making their protection urgent.









Another important result was exploring the linkage between protected lands and the risk of extinction from future climate change. Although it is obvious that more protected lands is better for biodiversity and further that that should hold for reducing risk of extinction from climate change, quantitative relationships had not been produced for large areas before. Overall our assessment found that extinction risk drops most dramatically when increasing from about 15% protected lands to about 30%. Currently about 15% of land is protected, and many conservation treaties seek to protect up to 30%. This study validated that there are indeed major reductions in extinction risk in moving from where we are today to protecting about twice as much land. At the same time this study demonstrated the need for protecting more land, it also shows that there are major benefits to biodiversity even if a majority of the land remains devoted to human needs. Such win-win outcomes are desperately needed in conservation. 

In addition to informing conservation efforts and providing new tools to other scientists working in biodiversity informatics, this project provided training to about a dozen graduate students and postdocs in this newly emerging field at the interface of traditional ecology and data science. Most of these students plan to go into biodiversity informatics themselves, but some have transferred their data science skills into industry unrelated to biodiversity. Either way, training experts in data science helps to close the large gap between needed and available personnel in this rapidly growing field.
