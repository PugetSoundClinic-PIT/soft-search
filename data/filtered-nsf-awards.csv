"The functional molecules in cells are proteins - the expression, activity and interactions of particular proteins in any given cell define its structure and what it is capable of doing. The technologies used to study proteins on a large scale are collectively called proteomics. The main method used in proteomics is mass spectrometry (MS), which can calculate the molecular weight and abundance of molecules. The majority of proteomics workflows perform a step of protein digestion prior to MS. The result of digestion is that all the proteins become broken up into small chains, called peptides. This step has become common, because peptides are easier to analyse by MS, due to their lower mass, producing simpler data to interpret. One challenge in this digestion step is that some proteins break down quickly whereas for others digestion is incomplete, producing unreliable quantification data that are not fully understood or compensated for by current analysis software. To overcome this problem, the University of Texas Anderson Cancer Center will collaborate with the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom to develop an integrated suite of analysis techniques using a powerful statistical technique called Bayesian modelling. These advances will be incorporated into a freely available software suite.
  
Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) coupled to Liquid Chromatography (LC) is the primary technique used in proteomics. The most common approach is LC separation of tryptic fragments derived from a proteome digestion, followed by tandem MS of the peptides. This entire workflow is conceived as a series of discrete steps, some chemical, some instrumental, some informatics and some statistical. Existing software concentrates on subcomponents of the workflow, and comprise a series of deterministic, self-contained steps. This project will translate the whole protein quantification pipeline into a rigorous statistical framework underpinned by Bayesian methodology. The new framework will integrate evidence across all experimentally acquired datasets, and borrow strength from unused structure within a proteomics workflow, including digestion dynamics. The proposed pipeline consists of three synergistic developments (1) Utilization of all unidentified (peptide) features, as well as identified features, to infer the most likely mixture of proteins present in a sample; (2) Differential quantification of complex mixtures of known proteoforms; (3) Discovery of unknown proteoforms and all modifications (PTMs) carried by their quantification signatures. These advancements will elicit a step-change in quantification sensitivity and interpretation at the proteoform level for the first time. The end-to-end analysis solution will be made available within the user-centric standards compliant ProteoSuite package, and as a Galaxy workflow for high-throughput pipelines.",NSF,University of Pennsylvania,PA,98079,2016487,jeffrey.morris@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,Jeffrey,Morris,0,"From this award, we have developed a set of statistical tools designed for extracting meaningful information about proteins expressed in a clinical sample that might have clinical or biological utility, and would be missed by simple, standard approaches.  We treat these data as ""complex functional data"", a type of data increasingly encountered in many areas of biological and medical research.  The develop,ent of general rigorous methods for these data that can model the entire data set without discarding information contained in the rich data, while accounting for their complex internal structure, promises to make a strong impact in many areas of biomedical research, withthe key being the ability to uncover insights contained in the data that would have been missed by simplistic current analytical approaches.  

While motivated by and applied to protein data applications in which the protein expressions in a clinical sample are used to infer information about the patient's clinical response or undelrying biological processes, the methods have broad application in many other data types including but not limited to genomic data, wearable devices, imaging data, and climate data.  In this grant period, we have developed a suite of models, methods, and software to fit them and freely shared these with the broad research community.  Besides developing these tools, we have also applied them to reveal important insights into various types of cancers as well as glaucoma.  

This work has produced dozens of peer-reviewed publications in statistical, biological, and clinical journals as well as numerous talks at national and international conferences.

"Biologists are deluged with sequence data yet have derived comparatively little biological information from it. The accurate annotation of protein function is key to understanding life, but experimentally determining what each protein does is costly and difficult, and cannot scale up to accommodate the vast amount of sequence data already available. Therefore discovering protein protein function by computational, rather than experimental means, is of primary importance. Genomic sequence data are available from thousands of species,  and those are coupled with massive high-throughput experimental data. Together, these data have created new opportunities as well as challenges for computational function prediction. As a result, many computational annotation methods have been developed by research groups worldwide, but their accuracy and applicability need to be improved upon. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG) is to bring together computational biologists, experimental biologists and biocurators who are dealing with the important problem of predicting protein function, to share ideas, and create collaborations. To improve computational function prediction methods, the Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation algorithms (CAFA) was established as an ongoing experiment. CAFA was designed to provide a large-scale assessment of computational methods dedicated to predicting protein function. By challenging dozens of research groups worldwide to develop and provide their best software for function prediction, the researchers involved in the AFP-SIG will improve the ability of biologists to understand life at the molecular level. The AFP-SIG researchers will also generate experimental data from fruit-flies, fungi and bacteria to be used as benchmarks to test the software participating in CAFA, and a deeper understanding of these model organisms. 

It is now possible to collect data that comprehensively profile many different states of complex biological systems. Using these data it should be possible to understand and explain the underlying systems, but significant challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is that, as researchers collect more data from many different organisms in many different systems, they discover more and different genes. Assigning functions to these newly discovered genes represents a key step towards interpretation of high-throughput data. This leads to a critical need to assess the quality of the function prediction methods that researchers have developed in recent years. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG), founded in 2005, is to bring together bioinformaticians and biologists who are addressing this key challenge of gene function prediction. In addition to sharing ideas and creating collaboration, AFP-SIG has created CAFA: the Critical Assessment of (protein) Function Annotation. CAFA is a community-driven challenge to assess the performance of protein function prediction software, and it has been carried out twice since 2010.  The investigators will provide the following outcomes: (1) robust open-source software to be used in function prediction and assessment of function prediction methods, incorporated into the high-profile annotation pipelines of UniProt-GOA; (2) expansion of the AFP community by engaging bioinformaticians, biocurators and experimentalists, thereby improving the quality and relevance of function prediction methods; (3) large-scale experimental screens in Drosophila, Candida and Pseudomonas for novel associations of targeted functional terms with genes; (4) an expanded CAFA event, incorporating both the curated annotations from the literature and our own experimental screens, in the last two years of the project. The progress of the AFP-SIG and CAFA will be available from http://BioFunctionPrediction.org",NSF,Northeastern University,MA,82617,1854685,predrag@northeastern.edu,Predrag,Radivojac,0,"One of the key and most complex questions in the life sciences today is understanding the workings of life at a molecular level. In order to speed up discovery, however, it is necessary to combine experimental science and computation. Methodologies for protein function prediction are therefore an important component to the bigger questions as only a small fraction of these macromolecules can be studied in depth experimentally, where for the vast majority of them we might only be able to predict their biological roles. As there had been many methods for protein function prediction, we proposed to establish an independent and authoritative assessment of these techniques so that the scientific community and general public are aware of the state of the art in the field and also to stimulate further discovery in the field. We have done this successfully and fortunately we can report that in the past five years there has been an improvement in the overall accuracy of function prediction methods. Depending on their application, they can be used to understand general trends about functionalities of newly sequenced organisms or to prioritize biological experiments and optimize resource allocation. As part of the independent evaluation, we have performed our own experiments and have assigned functional terms to more than 1000 proteins from three species, thus demonstrating the synergy between experiment and computation. This project has also developed methodologies and approaches that extend to general science, mostly machine learning and through machine learning to many other fields. We have proposed new methods for dealing with data from so-called open world domains, where molecular data belongs, which will have applications in diverse fields. We have also established novel distance functions that unify some known distances across different types of data.  We have held four scientific meetings with more than 500 delegates in total, providing a forum for exchange of ideas and also networking opportunities. Finally, we have trained new generation of graduate students with the ability to think critically and work independently in this and related fields. We have also trained undergraduate researchers, two of whom have been from HBCU's. Both of these individuals have later proceeded to go to the graduate school. Overall, we believe this project has been highly successful.

"Humans have unique upright body posture and related anatomy, but paleontologists are not certain when these features first appeared in the hominin lineage. The aim of this doctoral research project is to functionally describe the anatomy of the primate neck to understand how differences in the neck are related to head posture, body posture, and locomotion in primates. The project will provide data that may be used for inferring when a human-like neck first appeared and how this anatomical change was associated with environmental, behavioral and biological factors. This study will employ a combination of 3D anatomical methods including CT scanning, digital muscle fascicle tracking, and biomechanical modeling, which will serve as training tools for future researchers and health care professionals. The 3D models generated in this study will be used in K-12 science education and outreach events for discussing human anatomy and primate conservation.

The objective of this study is to both characterize and quantify neck muscle anatomy in primates with different habitual body postures and locomotor behaviors. Using a biomechanical framework, the project will compare functional differences in neck musculature that are key for behaviors such as holding up the head and movement of the arms during suspension. Novel techniques including contrast-enhanced computed tomography, muscle fascicle tracking software, and 3D lever mechanics will be used to develop biomechanical models of how variation in muscle size, shape, and distribution is related to postural and locomotor behavior across primates. These biomechanical models will be applied to fossil hominins (Australopithecus sediba and Homo neanderthalensis) to interpret their neck anatomy and posture to more accurately understand and reconstruct their behaviors.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Missouri-Columbia,MO,8576,1919475,wardcv@missouri.edu,Carol,Ward,1,"This project sought to understand the evolution of our own species through the lens of function in the musculoskeletal system. The ways in which the individual bones and muscles are arranged both internally and externally, can help us understand their function. The neck is a complex structure in that it supports the head, helps an organism navigate through its environment, and participates in feeding and swallowing. Primates are noted for diversity in locomotor behaviors, diet, as well as large brains relative to body size. As such, the head, neck, and musculature that spans between them can be potentially tied to any or all these functions.

While we know that species such as Australopithecus afarensis, which includes ?Lucy,? were bipedal, we still do not understand how their head was positioned relative to their trunk (i.e., neck posture) nor how much time they may have spent in trees. Further, we know that the ?Lucy? species was likely not the first upright biped in our lineage. In fossil human ancestors, the shape and size of the bones of the nuchal plane and cervical vertebrae (back of the head and neck) are thought to be a functional complex that helps balance and support of the head, rotates the neck, and serves as an anchor point to muscles involved in forelimb suspension. In particular, the position and the orientation of the foramen magnum and nuchal plane (parts of the cranium) and anatomy of the cervical vertebrae (neck bones), are used to make inferences about our own lineage and when and in what species upright posture and bipedal locomotion first appeared. Yet, no study to date has been able to quantify and understand how these muscles and bones work together to facilitate postural and locomotor behaviors. The goal of this study was to bridge our gap in knowledge on this subject using a variety of innovative techniques to understand how the neck works in our closest living relatives? the extant primates?before applying our knowledge to extinct species like our own fossil ancestors.

To understand how the nuchal muscles work across primates, this study used traditional dissection methods, contrast enhanced MicroCT scanning, as well as 3D lever mechanics to assess functional hypotheses. We sought to answer how postural and locomotor behaviors affect the size, shape and attachment sites of the muscles that span the back of the head and neck in a sample of primate cadavers. Specifically, this study was able to develop and apply new methods of semi-automatic muscle fascicle tracking, which allows for relatively non-invasive ways of quantifying muscle fascicle orientation, length, and number which are components of muscle function.

Results demonstrate that the shape and inferred function of the nuchal muscles do not reflect postural and locomotor behaviors as strongly as previously thought. There are a few exceptions to this finding. The first is that primates that have upright postures, like humans, demonstrate reduced force generation in a small muscle that extend the head and neck (longissimus capitis) compared to primates that have horizontal trunk postures. Second, primates that engage in vertical-clinging and leaping, like sifaka lemurs and the tarsier, may have modified neck muscles that allow them to rotate their head and neck more readily. Further, suspensory and semisuspensory behaviors (i.e., hanging from the arms) may influence the attachment size and orientation of the trapezius muscle in some primates, but this may not necessarily translate to an overall more powerful trapezius muscle.

Combined, these findings suggest that there may be more variables at play in determining the function nuchal musculature. More research is required to understand how the size and shape of the face and head, which house vital organs like the brain, affect the size and shape of the posterior neck muscles before making claims about how early human ancestors used their necks to interact with their environments.

"Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Treponema pallidum subp. pallidum bacteria. It has recently reemerged as an urgent worldwide health crisis. The origin of the disease has been a mystery since its sudden appearance in Europe at the end of the 15th century and its subsequent rapid global spread. It has long been debated whether syphilis was introduced to Europe, perhaps from the Americas, or evolved from a form of treponemal infection that had been in Europe all along.  Graduate student Ziyu Wang and collaborators at The Pennsylvania State University will take a multi-faceted approach to investigate the pathogen's genetic diversity over the past 500 years in Europe to explore several possibilities to explain syphilis' origin in Europe. The current T. pallidum pathogens - associated with several related diseases - likely represent only the most successful or recently emerged genetic variants. Examined through an anthropological lens, ancient genomes when considered within the context of human sociocultural systems yield clues about the processes through which pathogens have achieved their evolutionary success. Ultimately a more informed understanding of the factors that contribute to the complex and dynamic interactions between humans and their pathogens provides a deep-time foundation for predicting the evolutionary trajectories of modern infectious pathogens and human responses. Today, as in the past, STI-related stigma has done much to interfere with the development and implementation of effective intervention programs. Lessons learned from historic epidemics and the public response will provide valuable tools for training healthcare professionals, STI high-risk groups, and the public.

To untangle syphilis' origin, its evolution, and its worldwide spread, the research team will sequence T. pallidum genomes from representative specimens sampled from temporally and socially well-characterized European skeletal assemblages dating to the 16th to 19th centuries. Ancient T. pallidum has previously not been well studied because of the limited ability of conventional genetic techniques (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) to recover highly-degraded ancient pathogen DNA. Here a sensitive targeted hybridization capture technique will be used to recover complete, or near-complete, ancient T. pallidum genomes. By comparing temporally known ancient pathogen genomes with their modern equivalents, the research team can track the sequential changes that occurred in the pathogen's genetic history. Doing so will narrow the possible evolutionary scenarios for the origin of syphilis and point to when the pathogen variant that causes syphilis first emerged.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,31972,1919662,ghp3@psu.edu,George,Perry,1,"Syphilis (caused by Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum; TPA) is a known sexually transmitted infection (STI) with a global distribution of approximately six million new cases annually. As a disease of great historical importance, the geographic origin of syphilis, in connection with its first recorded epidemic in Europe in 1495, has been at the center of a centuries-long debate. This was because the outbreak occurred at the beginning of a significant bidirectional exchange of humans, plants, animals, and microbes across the Atlantic. For centuries, the ""Columbian hypothesis"" claims that Columbus's crew introduced syphilis, a previously unknown disease, to Europe upon their return from the Americas in 1493. Alternatively, the pre-Columbian hypothesis argues that syphilis existed in Europe prior to Columbus. There are two nuanced views here, although both of them suggest an African origin for the disease. The first one, the Alternative hypothesis, pointed to the pathogen’s natural reservoirs found in wild non-human primates (NHPs) as a possible source, with the disease introduced to continental Europe through the slave trade prior to 1495. The second perspective (the Unitarian hypothesis) argues that the T. pallidum pathogen is ubiquitous around the globe. The pathogen spread with early Paleolithic human migrations out of Africa. Currently scientific data supporting these various narratives are limited. 

With 20th century medical knowledge, we now know that the precise causative agent of syphilis, TPA, is closely related to other T. pallidum subspecies of pertenue (TPE) and endemicum (TEN) that cause the endemic disease forms of yaws and bejel, respectively. These three diseases are collectively known as the human treponematoses. The pathogen subspecies of each disease form is morphologically and physiologically indistinguishable by microscopy or by serological tests of host antibodies. Healthcare professionals have to predominantly base their diagnoses on a careful consideration of clinical characteristics. However, the clinical manifestations of each disease form are highly variable, yet are strikingly similar to one another. Because of the overlap in clinical signs, diagnosis accuracy is frequently questioned, especially in regions where multiple treponematoses occur. Currently the precise identification of disease form by its responsible pathogen subspecies is only by molecular methods. 

Exactly which and how many forms of treponemal infection existed in Europe is currently unclear in historical documents and the archaeological record. Because syphilis is customarily known to be the only form of treponematosis that transmits sexually, it has been assumed that the bacterium responsible for the 1495 European epidemic is the same as, or has evolved into, TPA, the causative agent of modern syphilis. Although there are, at present, only a few such sequences, further work promises to clarify the evolutionary history of the treponemal diseases through a combination of ‘lost"" ancient T. pallidum genomes and paleopathological evidence.

To retrieve historical European T. pallidum genomes, we identified skeletal individuals with bony lesions consistent with the treponematoses in three large and well-characterized Danish archaeological skeletal assemblages: 1) Lindegarden, Ribe; (n=215; AD 1427-1805); 2) Gr&aring;br&oslash;dre, Svendborg (n=200; AD 1500-1600); and 3) Klosterkirken, Horsens (n= 221; AD 1750-1856). For a multi-stage paleogenomic study, we sampled teeth from individuals (&ge;15 years old) with (n=39) and without (n=11) skeletal lesions suggestive of treponemal infection. First, we screened metagenomic/shotgun sequences recovered from the teeth of these 50 individuals for genetic signatures of T. pallidum. Then, for 18 samples identified with putative T. pallidum DNA, we used a targeted whole genomic hybridization capture approach to enrich for T. pallidum DNA fragments prior to another round of sequencing. A novel ancient T. pallidum draft genome was identified in individual AG51 from the Gr&aring;br&oslash;dre cemetery in Svendborg, along with 17 samples of low-genome coverage. This newly reconstructed Danish ancient T. pallidum genome is phylogenetically placed within the TPE lineage. This indicates that TPE was an agent of treponematosis that existed in the once-living Danish community. This novel Danish TPE genome is closely related to all historical TPE genomes recovered from human remains dated to the 16th to 18th centuries. Our finding, when added to a growing body of ancient T. pallidum genomics evidence from the early modern Europe, suggests that the documented European ""syphilis"" epidemics starting in 1495, along with its subsequent global spread, might have been causes by multiple T. pallidum lineages, not just TPA. Drawing from multidisciplinary perspectives, we further suggest a complex evolutionary process of T. pallidum with a possible early origin from Africa and multiple dispersion events facilitated by human population movements throughout history.

"The human tongue and hyoid bone have been extensively studied for their role in the evolution of speech. Some researchers hypothesize that our unique tongue and hyoid morphology also makes us more prone to choking. This research uses advanced imaging techniques and computational modeling to test whether human hyolingual morphology is beneficial or detrimental for swallowing. While this research focuses on swallowing function in an evolutionary context, the findings of this research will also advance our understanding of normal swallowing mechanisms and therefore may have clinical applications. The software for the computational model generated by this project will be made freely available upon completion. This project provides mentored research not only to a woman in science but specifically one studying biomechanics, a field in which women are underrepresented. Furthermore, the project will support undergraduate research and training for a diverse group of students at the University of Chicago.

The short faces and low tongue, hyoid, and larynx of humans have been argued to be adapted for speech and maladapted for swallowing. Recent studies cast doubt on both of these claims, prompting further exploration of alternative hypotheses to explain the origin of the uniquely human hyolingual apparatus. This project tests the hypothesis that hyolingual biomechanics constrain morphology, specifically that a low hyolingual apparatus is necessary to maintain swallowing performance as the face becomes shorter. X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM), diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced CT (diceCT), and electromyography (EMG) will be used to obtain high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo measurements of bone, tongue, and muscle biomechanics, including hyolingual muscle length, velocity, and activity in a primate model system. These data will then be used to validate a computational model of the impacts on swallowing biomechanics and performance of variation in hyolingual position, and craniofacial morphology. Falsification of the constraint hypothesis would provide indirect support for the hypothesis that the morphology of the human vocal tract is the result of natural selection for speech performance. This project will inform future research on how the functional requirements of the hyolingual apparatus may have influenced the morphology of surrounding structures, e.g., the mandibular symphysis, in both extant and extinct taxa.",NSF,University of Chicago,IL,21974,1732175,rossc@uchicago.edu,Callum,Ross,1,"Swallowing is essential to vertebrate life, yet its biomechanical basis is poorly understood compared to other behaviors such as chewing, suction feeding, reaching, and locomotion. Human swallowing biomechanics is of clinical interest for treating dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, with neuromuscular rehabilitation. Swallowing is also of anthropological interest because purported adaptations for speech also allow food and air to mingle near an open larynx, which some argue renders humans maladapted to swallowing. However, this hypothesis has not been thoroughly tested and in fact is refuted by several studies of human feeding physiology. This dissertation research uses a macaque (Macaca mulatta) model system to determine the biomechanical basis of two important movements involved in bolus propulsion and airway protection&mdash;tongue base retraction and hyoid superoanterior excursion&mdash;and examines how changes in hyolingual and craniofacial morphology over the course of human evolution and ontogeny affect hyolingual biomechanics. Tongue base retraction was caused by neither extrinsic lingual muscle shortening nor hydrostatic deformation. Kinematic evidence suggests that suprahyoid muscles cause tongue base retraction by regionally changing tongue volume, which is consistent with a hydraulic linkage between the suprahyoid muscles and the tongue. These suprahyoid muscles not only actively shorten during tongue base retraction, but they also rotate as they move the hyoid. This rotation either amplifies or reduces hyoid velocity depending on the geometry of the muscle and the direction of rotation. In this way, suprahyoid muscles are functionally analogous to pennate muscles, which also exhibit fiber rotation and gearing. A computational model of hyoid range of motion validated against in vivo data demonstrates that hyoid descent&mdash;which is commonly assumed to be detrimental to swallowing&mdash;may actually help to maintain swallowing performance as the human face has shortened in recent evolutionary history, especially if tongue volume must be preserved to maintain a hydraulic linkage between the tongue and hyoid. Moreover, because mandibular morphology affects suprahyoid muscle length, selective pressure to maintain swallowing performance may have resulted in the emergence of humanity’s characteristic vertical mandibular symphysis and chin. However, geometric constraints require human suprahyoid muscles to shorten relatively more when the hyoid is descended, which may leave humans vulnerable to dysphagia not because the human airway allows for more mixing of food and air near the larynx but rather because of fundamental constraints on vertebrate skeletal muscle biomechanics. Given that muscles from the cranium, mandible, pharynx, soft palate, larynx, sternum, and scapula all converge on this nexus of the neck, the mammalian hyolingual apparatus may have an underappreciated role in shaping the structures from which it is so elegantly suspended.  

This project provided mentored research not only to women in science but specifically those studying biomechanics, a field in which women are underrepresented. The methodologies generated by this project can be used to generate further knowledge on how the functional requirements of the hyolingual apparatus may have influenced the morphology of surrounding structures, e.g., the mandibular symphysis, in both extant and extinct taxa.

"Understanding how gene by environment interactions result in specific phenotypes is a core goal of modern biology and has real-world impacts on such things as crop management. Developing and managing successful crop practices is a goal that is fundamentally tied to our national food security. By applying novel computational visual analytical methods, this project seeks to identify and unravel the complex web of interactions linking genotypes, environments and phenotypes. These methods will first need to be designed and developed into usable software applications that can handle large volumes of crop phenomics data. High-throughput sensing technologies collect large volumes of field data for many plant traits, such as flowering time, related to crop development and production. The maize cultivars used here come from multiple genotypes that have been grown under a variety of environmental conditions, in order to give the widest range of conditions for understanding the interactions. The resulting data sets are growing quickly, both in size and complexity, but the analytical tools needed to extract knowledge and catalyze scientific discoveries have significantly lagged behind. The methodologies to be developed in this project represent a systematic attempt at bridging this rapidly widening divide. The project is inherently interdisciplinary, involving close research partnerships among computer scientists, plant scientists, and mathematicians. The research outcomes will be tightly integrated with education using a multipronged approach that includes, among others, postdoctoral and student training (graduates and undergraduates), curriculum development for a new campus-wide interdisciplinary undergraduate degree in Data Analytics, conference tutorials for training phenomics data practitioners, and contribution to the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities (particularly women) in STEM fields through the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.


This project will lead to the design and development of a new, scalable, visual analytics platform suitable for hypothesis extraction and refinement from complex phenomics data sets. Focus on hypothesis extraction is critical in the context of phenomics data sets because much of the high-throughput sensing data being generated in crop fields are generated in the absence of specifically formulated hypotheses. Extracting plausible hypotheses from the data represents an important but tedious task. To this end, this project will apply and develop new capabilities using emerging advanced algorithmic principles, particularly from the branch of mathematics called algebraic topology that studies shapes and structure of complex data. The research objectives are three-fold. First, the project will employ and extend emerging algorithmic techniques from algebraic topology to decode the structure of large, complex phenomics data. Second, an interactive visual analytic platform will be developed to facilitate knowledge discovery using the extracted topological structures. Lastly, the quality and validity of a new visual analytic platform designed by this team will be tested using real-world maize data sets as well as simulated inputs as testbeds. The developed framework will encode functions for scientists to delineate hypotheses of three kinds: i) genetic characterization of single complex traits; ii) genetic characterization of multiple traits that share potentially pleiotropic effects; and iii) decoding and detailed characterization of genotype-by-environmental interactions, in particular, through a collaborative pilot study of maize flowering and growth traits. The expected significance of the proposed work is that biologists will be able to extract different types of testable hypotheses from plant phenomics data sets by employing a new class of visual analytic tools, and thus obtain a deeper understanding of the interactions among genotypes, environments and phenotypes. The project is potentially transformative in two ways: i) it will introduce advanced mathematical and computational principles into mainstream phenomic data analysis; and ii) it will usher in a new era where biologists spearhead data-driven hypothesis extraction and discovery with the aid of interactive, informative, and intuitive tools. The project will have a direct impact on the state of software in phenomics for fundamental data-driven discovery. To facilitate broader community adoption, the project will integrate the tools into the CyVerse Institute, and to a community phenomics software outlet. It will also lead to the development of automated scientific workflows.

"Bacteria may acquire novel DNA from other bacteria in their environment through the process of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This transferred DNA often encodes new functions that expand an organism's niche, change its relationships with its host or provide a competitive edge against other organisms within its environment. For example, antibiotic resistance genes are frequently observed to be transferred between organisms. New high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies now allow researchers to simultaneously sequence data from millions of different bacterial species in a single sample, called metagenome sequencing. Thousands of publicly available metagenomic sequence datasets exist for samples from very diverse ecologies, including: gut microbiomes from humans, animals and insects, soil and root communities, surfaces in built environments, hydrothermal mats and vents, wastewater treatment plants, freshwater sources and marine ecosystems. Using these datasets, the research team will develop a suite of computational tools for examining the mobile gene content of these datasets, to identify those genes that may shape the response of microbial communities to stress. Graduate students will carry out the research under the direction of the PI, while undergraduates will be trained to use the resulting methods through a series of hackathons aimed at building the computational science community focused on microbial community research. Recruiting efforts will be aimed at measurably increasing the diversity in computational biology throughout the greater Finger Lakes region. 

Functional characterization of microbial communities is often performed using metagenomic shotgun data, obtained by sequencing microbial samples in their entirety. Yet, despite its importance, few methods exist to distinguish genes that are inherited versus those genes which have been mobilized and transferred between organisms in this type of short-read sequence data. By providing new computational methods for reconstructing mobile genetic elements in short-read data, researchers can tap into the huge resource of existing metagenomic data to examine the role of HGT in shaping the functions of natural microbial communities. This research will be transformative for all fields of microbiology, including clinical microbiology, microbiome research, environmental microbiology, and microbial engineering.",NSF,Cornell University,NY,1029606,1661338,ibrito@cornell.edu,Ilana,Brito,1,"Final Outcomes 

The flexible portion of a bacterium?s genome?the DNA that is exchanged with other bacteria through the process of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)?allows the organism to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions by obtaining and incorporating novel functions, including antibiotic resistance. Despite the importance of flexible DNA in shaping the roles of individual bacteria, basic facts about the frequency and conditions that promote HGT in natural ecosystems remain unknown. In this project, we aimed to implement several computational methods, using experimental or computational data, to determine the microbial hosts of specific mobile genes or genetic elements and to understand the nature of transfer between organisms.

Hi-C is a method by which distant or unconnected pieces of DNA can be physically linked and sequenced. After applying this method to gut microbiome samples, hybrid pieces of DNA need to be carefully analyzed to determine its sources. We developed a computational pipeline to determine the connections and internally validate them. We show that our approach can repeatedly recapitulate associations between mobile elements and host bacterial genomes. This has been published in Nature Communications (doi:10.1038/s41467-020-18164-7) and the code is available on Github.

We developed a computational pipeline to analyze single-cell fusion PCR data from a new method called OIL-PCR (Figure 1) that links mobile genes with their hosts. In this work, we examined strain-level carriage of mobile genes. This work, including our computational pipeline, is now published and available in eLife (doi:10.7554/eLife.66834).

A major question related to HGT is what governs which bacteria transfer with which bacteria. To answer this question, we amassed over 12,000 genomes equally representing the bacterial tree of life and modeled the recent transfer of mobile genetic elements. We applied several machine learning approaches and obtain near-perfect predictions of the HGT network (Figure 2), concluding that niche-specific genes largely govern HGT across the tree of life, but subnetworks of the transfer of specific genes are defined by HGT machinery genes and genes reflecting barriers to HGT. We further show that our approach can predict HGT networks of even small collections of organisms living in a specific ecology (marine, soil, plant roots, or human gut).This work has been accepted to Science Advances (Zhou et al., Sci. Adv. 2021; 7 : eabj5056).

These and other methods are outlined in a review written by Brito (PI) published in Nature Reviews Microbiology (doi:10.1038/ s41579-021-00534-7).

Broader Impacts: A major accomplishment of this award was our annual microbial genomics hackathons, held in 2018 and 2019 (our 2020 hackathon was canceled due to pandemic-related campus shutdowns). Our hackathons attracted both undergraduates and graduate students, who joined teams and apply computational tools to answer questions of their own choosing related to antibiotic resistance and microbiomes. Over the course of a weekend, with copious mentoring by faculty, senior graduate students and postdocs, students successfully applied a range of computational tools. The hackathon was paired with a 1-credit introductory course exposing students to the topic and basic coding skills. Students greatly appreciated the experience and it largely improved their confidence and overall interest in applying these tools and seeking future opportunities to broaden their education in computational biology.

"Due to the rapidly increasing volume of biological data from sequencing, imaging, and other technologies, data processing needs in the Life Sciences are now on par with physical and engineering disciplines. Importantly, the distributed nature of data generation in biology makes this situation even more challenging. Today one can hardly find a research institution or university without multiple high-throughput DNA sequencing machines, and there are often references to a ""data crisis"" in biology. Federal agencies, and the NSF in particular, are investing heavily in cyberinfrastructure by supporting development of high performance computing (HPC) resources such as the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE). Yet to a large extent, these resources remain unknown to biological researchers who overwhelmingly continue to rely on fragile in-house computation. The goal of this project is to ensure effective utilization of federal funds that have been invested into development of the national computing infrastructure. This project will extend the Galaxy software platform to leverage existing NSF hardware resources, increasing the value of existing infrastructure for biology researchers that were previously unable to take full advantage of these resources.

This project will follow a comprehensive approach that addresses the needs of experimental scientists, tool developers, and administrators of high performance compute systems (HPC). Access to national compute infrastructure will be expanded so that Galaxy will function as a middleware interface to existing heterogeneous environments such as XSEDE or individual systems such as Jetstream. Software components necessary to optimize Galaxy as a link between researchers and existing HPC will be developed based on pilot projects with the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), XSEDE, PSC, and Indiana University. (2) XSEDE resources to enable interactive data exploration and visualization will be leveraged to expand Galaxy's current capacity for dynamic scientific data analysis.  Integration with Interactive Analysis Environments, such as Jupyter or RStudio will allow manipulation and creation of Galaxy datasets using common scripting languages. Taking advantage of XSEDE resources will enable Galaxy's interactive environments and visual analytics to scale to large datasets and sophisticated workflows. (3) Sustainable training and outreach will focus on creating and disseminating curricula that enable investigators to learn skills needed to analyze large datasets. Creation of pre-configured infrastructure components for running workshops and develop modules for undergraduate and graduate face-to-face and on-line classes will expand the current educational portfolio to scale support for increasing numbers of Galaxy users, including disciplines beyond life sciences such as Natural Language Processing.

This infrastructure serves thousands of researchers worldwide performing millions of analyses every year (see https://galaxyproject.org/galaxy-project/statistics/). Specifically, this software enables individual research groups, labs or intitutions to deploy ""Galaxy instances"". An instance of Galaxy is an application that allows users to apply a wide variety of command-line, web-based, or interactive tools to any type of data through a web-browser (or programmatically via application programming interface [API]). A Galaxy instance can be configured to manage local or remote computational resources to schedule tool runs on any modern computational infrastructure including local hardware, conventional clusters, commercial or public clouds, and so on. The Galaxy team also develops and operates the Galaxy ToolShed--a growing repository of &gt;8,500 analysis tools available for use in Galaxy. The ToolShed is closely aligned with the BioConda community, making it simple to add BioConda tools to the ToolShed and enabling Galaxy to automatically resolve software dependencies of analysis tools. The Galaxy software ecosystem also includes scheduling tools, tool development utilities, training infrastructure, and many other components.

The main public Galaxy site (https://usegalaxy.org) is an example of a Galaxy instance. It is located at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) and schedules jobs on a variety of geographically distributed resources such as Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and JetStream cloud at Indiana University. It supports thousands of users running hundreds of thousands jobs per month and stores &gt;5Pb of user data.

There is a comprehensive collection of tutorials covering all aspects of Galaxy from basic functionality to advanced analyses (https://training.galaxyproject.org). It is an excellent resource for learning about the system we seek to continue building as described in this proposal.

"An award is made to the University of Maryland to bring together a network of butterfly monitoring groups and experts in both informatics and statistics to develop a series of tools to greatly expand the access and use of butterfly data and knowledge. Citizen-scientists throughout North America perform thousands of surveys as part of a continent-wide network of butterfly monitoring programs, yet data from these surveys, are little known due to a lack of:  1) knowledge about and access to the data, 2) tools to visualize and share these critical data sets, and 3) appropriate models for analysis. Through this project, several new tools will be developed and launched, including a web interface and visualization tool for a continental-scale butterfly monitoring program, a framework for the distribution and visualization for data emerging from a large network of butterfly monitoring programs, and a web-enabled database of species traits, and a suite of statistical models to analyze data resulting from the most common types of butterfly monitoring protocols. 

All efforts will be targeted toward developing tools that are broadly transferrable among butterfly monitoring programs as well as other insect monitoring programs, such as those focused on dragonflies, crickets, ladybeetles, and bees.   Tools will be designed to be useful not just to the scientific and management communities, but also for the general public, the primary collectors of butterfly monitoring data.  Throughout this project, undergraduates, graduates, and post-doctoral associates will be involved in all stages to foster education in information technology and statistical analysis.",NSF,Georgetown University,DC,177315,1738243,Leslie.Ries@georgetown.edu,Leslie,Ries,0,"Historically, the most common type of biodiversity data was specimens collected in the field and kept in museums.  However, over the past 30 years, the focus of biodiversity data collection has shifted radically from museum specimens to large-scale citizen science data collection programs, and nowhere is this more obvious than for butterflies.  Butterfly monitoring has grown exponentially over the last few decades with programs expanding in North America, Europe, and Asia.  Yet as late as the mid-2000s, the availability of large-scale survey data in North America was little known and even less used by the public or the scientific community.  Indeed, by 2006 there were only five peer-reviewed studies published using large-scale butterfly survey data from any North American program, even though these data had been collected since the mid-1970s (Fig. 1).  At the time, there was also a small but growing network of regional butterfly monitoring programs that used academic-like structured surveys (called Pollard Walks).  However, the use and even knowledge of those butterfly monitoring data in North America was hindered due to a series of informatics-related barriers. 

The overarching goal of this project was to eliminate those barriers, promote the knowledge and use of butterfly monitoring data in North America and provide the cyber-infrastructure to support and expand this growing network.  Note that this award to Georgetown University (DBI 1738243) is a transfer of an award originally made to the University of Maryland (DBI 1147049).  The final outcomes described here include achievements made during the performance phases at both the University of Maryland and Georgetown University.   In addition to the three goals defined in the original proposal, we substantially expanded the scope of our project by adding three additional goals.   We describe the final outcomes under each of these six goals.

1) Develop a data management system which includes a download and visualization tool for survey data from the North American Butterfly Association (NABA) count program.  

All historical data (back to 1977) were ingested into a new platform developed to manage, share and visualize these data.  This included over 600,000 observations made during 10,000 surveys across the US and Canada.  This web-enabled database was launched in 2015 and is available at www.webutterfly.org.  Data from these NABA surveys have been used in 8 peer-reviewed publications since the launch of this original project in 2012.  

2) Develop the best statistical approaches and research tools to analyze butterfly monitoring data.  

Much of the statistical development was accomplished and published in the papers presenting results from the various monitoring programs.  To date, the programs which we have used for scientific publications were largely from NABA (8 publications), The Ohio Butterfly Monitoring Network (7 publications) and the Illinois Butterfly Monitoring Network (4 publications).  Two methods papers (one on integrating data from multiple regional networks and one on using data for joint species distribution models) were also published in 2016.

3) Develop a knowledgebase of butterfly life history and ecological traits

We have digitized records from over 10 North American Field guides to butterflies.  We summarized those traits in an initial database for 500 species of butterflies.  That work is being continued under the auspices of an ongoing NSF-funded project GoLife: 1541557 (ButterflyNet--an integrative framework for comparative biology).  We anticipate that the trait database from this work will be released online in 2020.    

4) Expanded scope:  Develop a data management and visualization system for regional butterfly monitoring programs.

During our inaugrual workshop in May 2012, a lack of data management tools was identified as a primary barrier to the expansion and use of butterfly monitoring data from regional monitoring programs.  We thus developed an online portal, called PollardBase (www.pollardbase.org) which was launched in 2014.  Currently there are over 15 programs with 600 active users on Pollardbase and we have ingested approximately 12000 historical survey data into the portal and over 9000 additional surveys have been entered directly by PollardBase volunteers.   

5) Expanded scope: Develop an umbrella organization to serve the needs of those producing, using, or developing systems to manage and share citizen-science butterfly data in North America.

In our inaugural workshop in May 2012, we decided to form an umbrella organization to serve the wider needs and more closely connect the butterfly monitoring community.  As such, we formed the North American Butterfly Monitoring Network and PI-Ries currently serves as its director (www.thebutterflynetwork.org).  A sister site focused on monarch-centric citizen science (www.monarchnet.org) was also launched. 

6) Expanded scope: Use butterfly data in undergraduate teaching to introduce students to data-intensive approaches to ecology.

PI Ries has worked with two classroom instructors to bring these approaches into the classroom based on NABA butterfly data.  She has recently submitted a manuscript to Ecosphere describing these various activities (and including a formal assessment of outcomes for one of them).

"Analyzing single neuron's property is a fundamental task to understand the nervous system and brain working mechanism. Investigating neuron morphology is an effective way to analyze neurons, since it plays a major role in determining neurons' properties. Recently, the ever-increasing neuron databases have greatly facilitated the research of neuron morphology. However, the sheer volume and complexity of these data pose significant challenges for computational analysis, preventing the realization of the full potential of such data. This interdisciplinary project will seek for new avenue to assemble the massive neuron morphologies and provide a unified framework for neuroscientists to explore and analyze different types of neurons. The research is able to tackle many challenges in neuroscience which are hard to solve with previous methods, including fine-grained neuron identification, latent pattern discovery and exploration, etc. The large-scale methods being developed will be particularly beneficial in the future of neuroscience, since more and more neurons are reconstructed and added to the databases. The computational methods and tools developed are very likely to be applicable for solving other bioinformatics problems, especially those dealing with large-scale datasets. The broader impact of this project not only includes educational support for undergraduate researchers and high school students, particularly women and those underrepresented groups, but also contributes to the research of neuroscience and other STEM fields.

The long-term goal of this project is to develop effective computational methods and tools for neuroscientists to interactively explore large-scale neuron databases with ultra-fine-grained accuracy, in real-time. This research has a strong multidisciplinary component that involves a nexus ideas from machine learning, information retrieval, and neuroinformatics. Particularly, novel ideas will be implemented in three inter-related components through the whole framework. The first one addresses the accurate and efficient neuron reconstruction and tracing based on deep learning models. The second addresses the efficient discovery of relevant instances among large-size neuron databases via multi-modal and online binary coding methods. The third part addresses intelligent visualization and interaction schemes for knowledge discovery and mining, equipped with interactive coding that can incorporate domain experts' feedback to enhance the query algorithms for fine-tuned results. Compared with previous methods and systems, this project will open a new avenue to assist neuroscientists analyzing and exploring large-scale neuron databases with high efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. The performance of proposed methods will be validated using public neuro-morphological databases (e.g., NeuroMorpho, BigNeuron) and compared with several benchmarks. The effectiveness of the tools to be developed will be evaluated by neuroscientists on domain-specific hypothesis-driven applications. The outcome of the project will be made available at the following websites: http://webpages.uncc.edu/~szhang16/  and https://github.com/divelab/.",NSF,Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station,TX,146452,2028361,sji@tamu.edu,Shuiwang,Ji,1,"Investigating the shapes of neurons is fundamental to understanding brain functions. This project studies neuron tracing, also known as neuron reconstruction, which aims at building 3D morphological structures of neurons from imaging data, such as laser scanning microscopy images. A major challenge is that laser scanning microscopy images usually have low signal-to-noise ratio and may contain discontinued segments of neurite patterns, making it challenging to perform tracing directly from raw microscopy images. This raises the need of an effective and automatic denoising algorithm to reduce the effect of noise and discontinued segments. In this project, we developed a set of novel deep learning methods for improving the performance of 3D neuron reconstruction from microscopy images. We treat the de-noising problem as an image transformation task in which deep models transform an input image into an output image. The models are trained to determine which voxels in 3D microscopy images belong to neurons. We developed both supervised and self-supervised deep learning methods for denoising images. We used imaging datasets from the BigNeuron project and other biological and natural images to evaluate our methods. Results show that our methods outperform prior methods and lead to improved performance on downstream tasks. Multiple high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students have been trained throughout this project.

"Skeletal remains are important sources of information on temporal trends in human health. Porous cranial lesions (PCLs) are interpreted as indicators of nutrient deficiencies and chronic infections and are among the most common pathological findings in human skeletal remains. This doctoral dissertation project uses methods previously applied primarily in archaeological contexts to investigating the causes of PCLs and the health of individuals who live with them. Specifically, the researchers will use an archaeological reference sample to develop computed tomography (CT) criteria for identifying PCLs in living individuals. They will then link measures of individual health to PCL findings from existing CT scans of a living population. Protocols and tools developed for PCL analysis will be made freely available online. The project will strengthen institutional capacity for future research collaborations and support STEM student training at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Because PCLs are developed during childhood, the methods developed in this proposal will have implications for public health across the lifespan. 

PCLs in archaeological samples have been interpreted as evidence of both stress and resilience. This project attempts to resolve this ambiguity by leveraging existing data drawn from a living population to test the association of PCLs in the orbits (cribra orbitalia) and the cranial vault (porotic hyperostosis) with known health profiles. First, the researchers will develop a protocol to extend archaeological methods to determining the prevalence of PCLs in a living population. Specifically, investigators will employ both visual assessments of CT scans and machine learning to reliably identify the presence and extent of PCLs on cranial CT scans using a reference sample of archaeological crania (n = 600). Once developed, investigators will apply the protocol to identify PCLs on existing cranial CTs of 1,310 living adults with known health profiles. This will link childhood development of PCLs to measures of later life health, including biological markers, medical diagnoses, and self-reported wellness. Finally, this project tests the common interpretation of PCLs as indicators of childhood anemia. Using biological markers from dried blood spot samples from children in the same population of living individuals (n = 480), investigators will identify the underlying causes of individual anemia cases and test their association with a biological marker of active bone remodeling.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of California-Santa Barbara,CA,31044,1945794,gurven@anth.ucsb.edu,Michael,Gurven,1,"This project was the first study to examine porous cranial lesions in the bones of the orbits (cribra orbitalia) and cranial vault (cribra cranii) in a population-representative sample of living people. These lesions are commonly reported by archaeologists as skeletal indicators of childhood stress, who attribute them to either infectious or nutritional causes in early life.

We first tested the sensitivity and accuracy of clinical computed tomography scans for identifying cranial lesions in living people by scanning archaeological crania with a range of lesion presentations. We found that moderate to severe cases of cranial porosity could be reliably documented from CT scans using settings intended to diagnose cranial fractures.  

We then evaluated existing head scans of adults aged 40+ years from the Tsimane population of Bolivia for cranial lesions presumably developed in early childhood. Using twenty years of health data from the Tsimane Health and Life History Project, we investigated the relationship between 1) cranial lesions and childhood health and 2) cranial lesions and morbidity in later life.

We found that cranial lesions were not associated with other measures of childhood illness or growth disruption (memories of childhood sickness; leg length relative to total height). However, we do find that shared childhood household is an independent predictor of lesion status, supporting the idea that childhood environment plays a role in the development of these skeletal lesions.

There is some evidence that cribra orbitalia is associated with immunocompromise in Tsimane adults, suggesting lifelong health consequences of lesion-causing processes in early life. Cribra orbitalia is associated with lower measures for some markers of adaptive immunity (fewer B cells, na?ve CD4+ T cells, and a lower ratio of total CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells) and with a greater risk of developing active tuberculosis. Cribra cranii, on the other hand, predicts double the risk of headaches but is not associated with notable differences in physiological measures.

We also assayed dried blood spots from Tsimane children for measures of iron deficiency (serum transferrin receptor), inflammation (C-reactive protein), and skeletal activity (osteocalcin) to investigate relationships between nutrient deficiency, infection, and processes of skeletal change during childhood. At the time of writing analyses are still underway, but initial explorations show a negative relationship between iron levels and skeletal activity, perhaps suggesting that childhood anemia, a known cause of cranial changes, is not the predominant cause of porous cranial lesions in this population.

"Humans evolved very large brains relative to their body size, with a remarkable enrichment of neurons in the cerebral cortex. Extensive efforts in anthropology have focused on delineating the adaptive pressures that led to these changes during human evolution. However, the genetic changes underlying human brain expansion have not been fully explored. This project will test hypotheses about human brain evolution by studying the impact of human genetic variation on brain development using experimental models. This research has broad implications for understanding what makes the human brain unique at the cellular and molecular levels, with translational value for medical treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. During this research, undergraduate students pursuing careers in STEM will be mentored and trained in molecular biology and bioinformatics techniques in the laboratory. Research findings will be used as 1) an educational tool for spreading knowledge about human evolution and genetics with the general public, K-12 students, and undergraduate students, as well as 2) a motivational platform for the young, future women scientists in the Females Excelling More in Mathematics, Engineering and Science (FEMMES) Program. 

The proposed research takes a multi-disciplinary approach to investigate how human evolutionary history has shaped the molecular and physiological mechanisms of human brain expansion. In the laboratory, human and non-human primate neural cells will be studied to explore how genetic variation evolved in humans to shape the developing brain. This project uses a combination of gene editing, RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry to determine the functional role of human-specific genetic sequence during brain development that corresponds to changes in brain size. These findings will advance the understanding of the molecular evolution of the human brain.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Regents of the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor,MI,31039,1919671,sbielas@umich.edu,Stephanie,Bielas,1,"Humans have exceptionally large brains relative to their body size, with a remarkable enrichment of neurons in the cerebral cortex? the region critical for memory, cognition, and social behavior. Research in anthropology has helped delineate the adaptive pressures on brain expansion during our evolution. However, the genetics underlying human brain expansion, favored by natural selection, have not been well-explored. Prime candidates for the evolution of human brain expansion are genes that are unique to humans, disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders, and expressed in neural progenitor cells (NPCs)?the cells that build the brain by determining the number of neurons. In this study, we investigate the function of candidate NBPF genes, which have expanded in number in primate genomes and exceptionally in the human genome (Figure 1). This project experimentally tests hypotheses about human molecular origins by investigating the impact of human-specific genes on the development of the human cerebral cortex as well as establish a functional model for studying brain evolution. 

            Human and chimpanzee in vitro brain organoids?3D structures differentiated from stem cells that mimic in vivo brains?provide an unprecedented opportunity to generate functional data on how human-specific genetic changes shape the developing brain. Here, we used a two-step strategy to investigate the genetics of human cortical expansion: 1) gene editing to evaluate the effect of rapidly evolved human-specific genes in human brain organoids, and 2) genetic introduction of human genes into chimpanzee organoids to identify developmental mechanisms that determine cortex size.

            Expression of NBPF proteins has changed throughout primate evolution, resulting in novel expression of human NBPF proteins in NPCs. In this study, we found that NBPF proteins localize to the cytoplasm in human NPCs and show peak expression at microtubules during cell division (Figure 2). Compared to human NPCs, chimpanzee NPCs express very low levels of NBPF protein. We found evidence that NBPF proteins interact with each other, as well as other proteins that are important for cytoskeleton dynamics and communication with the extracellular matrix in human NPCs (Figure 3). Disruption to these aspects of cell biology during brain development can lead to clinical microcephaly (abnormally small brain). 

            Dynamic balance between NPC proliferation and differentiation informs neuronal identity and number. To investigate the role of human-specific NBPF in brain development, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing to deplete the expression of NBPF protein in NPCs. Using human brain organoid models, we observed a significant decrease in the number of proliferating cells, resulting in smaller organoids (Figure 4). In addition, NPCs in NBPF-depleted organoids started to differentiate to neurons earlier than control organoids, which acts to reduce the number of total neurons. Altogether, our findings support the hypothesis that NBPFs in human brain development influence NPC activity that is important to build a human brain. 

            Findings from this work have important implications for addressing interdisciplinary questions about human brain evolution as well as the role of NBPF proteins in neurodevelopmental disorders. This project has offered great opportunities for science communication and outreach locally and nationally, as well as mentorship and training.

"Scalp hair in the absence of body hair is a uniquely human trait, whose evolutionary significance is not well understood. This doctoral dissertation project will develop a digital tool for the quantitative measurement of hair fiber morphology, to investigate the underlying genetic architecture of hair morphology across human groups, and experimentally test the function of scalp hair as a barrier to solar heat gain. The methods developed as part of this project will advance our understanding of human adaptive traits and also inform forensic and dermatological research. Data collected for this project will increase the representation of understudied groups in research. This project will provide valuable research opportunities for undergraduates from groups underrepresented in STEM research fields and will generate materials for teaching about human biological diversity in a non-racial paradigm.

Human hair morphology varies on a continuous spectrum from straight to tightly curled; however, research in genetics, dermatology, and forensics incudes a range of descriptors that can be qualitative (e.g. wavy, frizzy) and racial (e.g. 'Caucasian hair,' 'African-type hair'). By developing a method to quantify hair morphology and studying the genetic variation in a diverse group of African Americans, this study leverages genetic admixture as a means of elucidating genotypes underlying hair morphology across human groups. The experimental work in this project will test the hypothesis that human scalp hair morphology evolved in early Homo as a protective mechanism against heat gain from solar radiation. This project will additionally carry out a series of tests of selection on candidate loci (previously associated with hair morphology or hair follicle development) to test whether there is evidence of selection in hair-related genes that would support a thermoregulatory explanation for the evolution of human scalp hair.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,31703,1847845,ngj2@psu.edu,Nina,Jablonski,1,"Co-PI Tina Lasisi completed her Ph.D. research on the project: ""Doctoral Dissertation Research: Investigating the genetic architecture and adaptive characteristics of human hair."" 
The project aimed to improve our understanding of how and why human’s evolved scalp hair that is variable in morphology. This work involved the development of new quantitative methods for phenotyping hair, analyses of genetic variation associated with hair morphology, and experimental work on heat transfer in relation to scalp hair. 
Lasisi successfully developed and released a Python package that allows for the automated analysis of both cross-sectional and longitudinal hair fiber images. Additionally, she has develop laboratory protocols for the preparations of cross-sectional and longitudinal (curvature) hair samples. Both the protocols and image analysis package are freely available and can be found through the project website (here) as well as the open-access publication on the methods (here). 
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, participant recruitment for the genetic research component could not be carried out as planned. However, Lasisi is using her newly developed hair phenotyping methods to analyze previously collected hair samples and plans to push this research forward as sampling becomes feasible again. Preliminary results on the potential for discovering new hair-related genetic loci are presented in the methods paper (here). 
Lastly, Lasisi carried out a novel experimental study on the effect of scalp hair morphology on heat transfer. Her results demonstrated that the presence of scalp hair significantly reduces heat gained from solar radiation and that tightly curled hair, in particular, minimizes heat gain from solar radiation. 
Results discussed in this report can be found in Lasisi’s doctoral dissertation which is freely available (here).  
 
The research funded by this grant has allowed Lasisi to produce novel research on an aspect of human biological variation that has historically been racialized and that remains poorly understood. This work has formed the basis of many of Lasisi’s science communication efforts and she continues to share her research and knowledge of human evolutionary biology through various public and social media outlets.

The brain is an enormously complex system, and the analysis of brain data is thus an equally enormous challenge. Human brains contain billions of neurons and trillions of synapses (junctions); and each of them is unique in their basic biochemistry, functions, and dynamics. The brain is also a multi-level system organized across different spatial scales, ranging from genes, synapses, and cells to circuits, brain regions, and systems. Today, brain science is experiencing rapid changes and is expected to achieve major advances in the near future. Recent technological innovations are enabling scientists to capture the gene expression patterns, connectivity, and neuronal activities at increasing speed and resolution. This is generating a deluge of data that capture the brain activities at different levels of organization. To attack the central challenges of analyzing these new data, this project will develop a class of efficient, integrative, multidimensional, predictive, and correlative techniques and use them to analyze large-scale, high-resolution, and multi-modality sets of brain data. Specifically, this project will develop analytics tools to predict the cellular-resolution, brain-wide connectome (""wiring diagram"") from genetic transcriptional profiles. This analysis will elucidate the information pathway from genes to connectivity and ultimately, to function. This project will also integrate other brain dimensions by performing multidimensional network correlative analytics. In addition, this project will address the relationship between gene expression, cell types, and brain structures. The success of this project will be a new class of efficient, robust analytics methods that are flexible enough to be adapted for integrating, modeling, and mining current and future brain data.

The results of this project will have an immediate and strong impact on multiple disciplines, including brain data analytics and computational neuroscience, biological image informatics, and big data analytics. A future long term goal is to uncover basic underlying differences between normal and impaired brain functions. The unified treatment of brain data analytics will be readily transformable into new courses for training next-generation computational biologists. The multidisciplinary nature of this project provides unique opportunities for integrating its components into existing curricula. Brain science has been shown to be a valuable resource for inspiring scientific interests in K-12 students. Components of the project will be integrated into an existing high-school student internship program, thereby inspiring future science students. Underrepresented students will be especially encouraged to participate throughout the project. The results of this project will be disseminated in the form of peer-reviewed publications, open-source software, tutorials, seminars, and workshops. All findings, publications, software, and data will be made publicly available at the project website: http://compbio.cs.odu.edu/CAREER/",NSF,Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station,TX,449380,1922969,sji@tamu.edu,Shuiwang,Ji,0,"The brain is an enormously complex system, and analysis of brain data is thus an equally enormous challenge.

This analysis elucidates the information pathway from genes to connectivity and ultimately, to function. Secondly, I integrated other brain dimensions by performing multidimensional network correlative analytics. This type of analysis is based on a new class of probability distributions defined on multidimensional data arrays. My third initiative addressed the relationship between gene expression, cell types, and brain structures. All of the novel analytics methods in this project is based on a common foundation of the sparsity learning paradigm, which was originally motivated by neuronal information processing mechanisms. Overall, I developed three novel and significant advances in the scientific field of computational brain data analytics. Each advance dramatically extended current analytics techniques towards understanding multi-level, complex brain systems. Altogether, I developed a unified approach to deciphering the brain structure and function and provide a systematic framework for developing the methodologies to implement them. Multiple high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students have been trained throughout this project.

"The science of forecasting where a species can live and how it responds to climate change is still in its infancy. A species' geographic range is the map of where a species can be found. It is fundamental to understanding species' ecology and evolution and increasingly plays a vital role in conservation. Collections of species ranges covering most of the 30,000 terrestrial vertebrate species are already available for scientific analysis. However, collections of species ranges from the other ~95% of species on the planet are rare. The time is ripe to change this. New access to vast quantities of data from biological inventories, museums, citizen science, and previously funded studies mean that adequate data are available to estimate the ranges of many more species. However, we are currently missing robust forecasting methods and the computational tools to produce large numbers of ranges. This project will develop the novel computational methods and algorithms needed to forecast the current state and future fate of the many thousands of poorly studied species ranges. These methods will be applied to forecast how 100,000+ plant species in the New World will respond to climate change. The researchers will test key assumptions in conservation biology about how species respond to changing climate and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots across North and South America have/will change over time.  The end result of their work will be a novel tool for the ecological community that has tremendous potential to guide biological sampling strategies, particularly in conservation and citizen science applications. 

The proposed research will examine whether biodiversity hotspots are constant through time and whether species climatic niches are phylogenetically conserved, two implicit assumptions with wide-reaching implications in conservation biology and basic ecology. This research will develop a workflow to predict species ranges for any taxonomic group using by combining occurrence data with GIS data. This workflow will be applied to all New World plants to study basic questions, such as how species richness varies across space and time (a topic studied almost exclusively in vertebrates and trees). Computationally, the project will address core challenges in data scrubbing, niche modeling practices, novel niche modeling methods, and mega-phylogeny analysis methods.  A freely available generic pipeline will be capable of linking biodiversity occurrence data to species ranges and scaling these computations to 1000s or 100,000s of species. This integrated pipeline will be implemented by: 1) appropriately scrubbing data to remove taxonomic and geographic errors, 2) identifying clear best practice methods for range modeling applicable across diverse species, 3) innovating range modeling methods that integrate diverse data such as presence only museum collections and abundance-based plot data 4) scaling computationally-intensive range modeling in an HPC environment, and 5) placing the outputs of the products in a phylogenetic context. This project will develop such a pipeline using a novel database of 20,000,000 observations of 100,000+ species of plants in the New World. The range forecasts produced will be used to test key assumptions in conservation biology about the phylogenetic conservatism of species climatic niches and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots over time. This research will make substantial contributions to scientific infrastructure through the development of a scientific codebase for the production of high-quality species ranges from primary biodiversity data.  The results of the project can be found via the following websites (http://bien.nceas.ucsb.edu/bien/ and bien3.org).",NSF,University of Connecticut,CT,62149,1913673,cory.merow@gmail.com,Cory,Merow,0,"This project is in the rapidly growing field of biodiversity informatics - the assemblages of large datasets that can inform scientists about biodiversity. 

The initial efforts in this project were to: 1) improve the largest database to date recording every scientific observation of a plant species available electronically. It eventually grew to have over 100,000,000 observations of plants with well over 100,000 species worldwide. 2) To use these observations to generate maps of species ranges, the areas where a species lives. A key focus in the first step was to scrub or clean the data. As you might imagine data collected by 1000s of scientists stored in hundreds of institutions is not particular standardized nor is it usually usually inspected for errors. But doing good science requires accurate information.  All of this data and the tools we developed are shared openly and freely with the scientific community to enhance their productivity in other biodiversity informatics endeavors (e.g. other groups of species). 

One key result from this work was discovering just how numerous rare species are. It has always been known that it was a rather common state to be rare (there are many more rare species than widely spread abundant species). But we were surprised just how many rare species there are among plants globally (almost 37% are extremely rare). There are more rare species than any existing theory predicted. We also mapped areas of the world known as hotspots that have a high number of rare species.  These areas become important targets for efforts to protect more land (e.g. by creating new national parks). In identifying these areas we also found that these areas are among some of the areas most impacted by humans and climate change, making their protection urgent.









Another important result was exploring the linkage between protected lands and the risk of extinction from future climate change. Although it is obvious that more protected lands is better for biodiversity and further that that should hold for reducing risk of extinction from climate change, quantitative relationships had not been produced for large areas before. Overall our assessment found that extinction risk drops most dramatically when increasing from about 15% protected lands to about 30%. Currently about 15% of land is protected, and many conservation treaties seek to protect up to 30%. This study validated that there are indeed major reductions in extinction risk in moving from where we are today to protecting about twice as much land. At the same time this study demonstrated the need for protecting more land, it also shows that there are major benefits to biodiversity even if a majority of the land remains devoted to human needs. Such win-win outcomes are desperately needed in conservation. 

In addition to informing conservation efforts and providing new tools to other scientists working in biodiversity informatics, this project provided training to about a dozen graduate students and postdocs in this newly emerging field at the interface of traditional ecology and data science. Most of these students plan to go into biodiversity informatics themselves, but some have transferred their data science skills into industry unrelated to biodiversity. Either way, training experts in data science helps to close the large gap between needed and available personnel in this rapidly growing field.

"Large-scale in situ hybridization (ISH) screens are providing an abundance of data showing spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression that are valuable for understanding the mechanisms of gene regulation. Knowledge gained from analysis of Drosophila expression patterns is widely important, because a large number of genes involved in fruit fly development are commonly found in humans and other species. Thus, research efforts into the spatial and temporal characteristics of Drosophila gene expression images have been at the leading-edge of scientific investigations into the fundamental principles of different species development. Drosophila gene expression pattern images enable the integration of spatial expression patterns with other genomic datasets that link regulator with their downstream targets. This project addresses the computational challenges in analyzing Drosophila gene expression patterns by leveraging a new bioinformatics software system. It focuses on designing principled bioinformatics and computational biology algorithms and tools that will integrate multi-modal spatial patterns of gene expression for Drosophila embryos' developmental stage recognition and anatomical ontology term annotation, and will infer gene interaction networks to generate a more comprehensive picture of gene function and interaction. The bioinformatics methods resulting from the project activities are broadly applicable to a variety of fields such as biomedical science and engineering, systems biology, clinical pathology, oncology, and pharmaceutics. Novel tools to enhance courses and research experiences for diverse populations of students are planned to broaden participation in science. 

This project investigates three challenging problems for studying the Drosophila embryo ISH Images via innovative bioinformatics algorithms: 1) the sparse multi-dimensional feature learning method to integrate the multimodal spatial gene expression patterns for annotating Drosophila ISH images, 2) the heterogeneous multi-task learning models using the high-order relational graph to jointly recognize the developmental stages and annotate anatomical ontology terms, 3) the embedded sparse representation algorithm to infer the gene interaction network. It is innovative to apply structured sparse learning, multi-task learning, and high-order relational graph models to Drosophila gene expression patterns analysis and holds great promise for scientific investigations into the fundamental principles of animal development. The algorithms and tools as outcomes of this research are expected to help knowledge discovery for applications in broader scientific and biological domains with massive high-dimensional and heterogeneous data sets. This project facilitates the development of novel educational tools to enhance several current courses at University of Texas at Arlington. The PIs engage minority students and under-served populations in research activities to provide opportunities for exposure to cutting-edge scientific research. For further information see the web site at: http://ranger.uta.edu/~heng/NSF-DBI-1356628.html",NSF,University of Pittsburgh,PA,112577,1836866,heng.huang@pitt.edu,Heng,Huang,0,"Our research findings are highly relevant to the interdisciplinary research of machine learning and bioinformatics. The investigation of this project produces several important outcomes.

 

1. We developed new multi-dimensional visual descriptors integration algorithm for Drosophila gene expression patterns anatomical annotations. To facilitate the search and comparison of Drosophila gene expression patterns during Drosophila embryogenesis, it is highly desirable to annotate the tissue-level anatomical ontology terms for ISH images. In ISH image annotations, the image content representation is crucial to achieve satisfactory results. However, existing methods mainly focus on improving the classification algorithms and only using simple visual descriptor. We proposed a novel structured sparsity-inducing norms based feature learning model to integrate the multi-dimensional visual descriptors for Drosophila gene expression patterns annotations. The new mixed norms are designed to learn the importance of different features from both local and global point of views. We successfully integrated six widely used visual descriptors to annotate the Drosophila gene expression patterns from the lateral, dorsal, and ventral views. The empirical results show that the proposed new method can effectively integrate different visual descriptors, and consistently outperforms related methods using the concatenated visual descriptors.

 

2. We developed a novel multi-instance learning model with learning biological relevance for Drosophila ISH image annotations. We explored the multi-instance learning (MIL) model for annotating Drosophila ISH gene expression images. We proposed to directly assess the relevance between annotation terms and image panels by using the Class-to-Bag (C2B) distance for MIL. We apply our new approach to automatic gene expression pattern classification and annotation on the Drosophila melanogaster species. Our experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the new multi-instance learning method.

 

3. We conducted biological network inference via minimizing joint capped norms based matrix recovery model. We used the low-rank matrix recovery model to predict the new links in biological networks. We proposed a new robust matrix recovery model to address the above two challenges. The joint capped trace norm and capped L1-norm are used to tightly approximate the rank minimization and enhance the robustness to outliers. The evaluation experiments are performed on both synthetic data and network link prediction task. All empirical results show our new method outperforms the existing matrix recovery methods. We applied the new model to infer the incomplete gene interaction network from Drosophila gene expression images.

 

4. We also designed new deep learning model to infer the incomplete gene interaction network from Drosophila gene expression images. We used the emerging deep neural network embedding model to predict the new links in biological networks. Network embedding has attracted increasing attention in recent data mining research with many important applications. We proposed a novel self-paced network embedding method. Specifically, our method can adaptively capture the informativeness of each node based on the current training state, and sample negative context nodes in terms of their informativeness. The proposed self-paced sampling strategy can gradually select difficult negative context nodes with training process going on to learn better node representations. Moreover, to better capture the node informativeness for learning node representations, we extended our method to the generative adversarial network framework, which has the larger capacity to discover node informativeness. The extensive experiments have been conducted on the biological network datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

 

5. We addressed the fast image retrieval problem of Drosophila gene expression data via designing a new unsupervised deep generative adversarial hashing network method. Considering the labeled Drosophila images are lacking, we proposed a new deep unsupervised hashing function, called HashGAN, which efficiently obtains binary representation of input Drosophila images without any supervised pretraining. In our experiments, HashGAN outperforms the previous unsupervised hash functions in image retrieval and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various datasets.

 

6. We designed new bilevel distance metric learning model to enhance the Drosophila gene expression image annotations. We integrated both feature extraction and metric learning into one joint optimization framework and proposed a new bilevel distance metric learning model. Specifically, the lower level characterizes the intrinsic data structure using graph regularized sparse coefficients, while the upper level forces the data samples from the same class to be close to each other and pushes those from different classes far away. Experiments on Drosophila gene expression image data demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our method.

 

7. We released the machine learning software tools at the project website.

 

We published over 40 full-length papers related to this project in peer-reviewed conference proceedings and journals.

 

This project supported three Ph.D. students (one of them is female) at University of Pittsburgh and University of Texas at Arlington. All of them have graduated and one of them becomes a tenure-track assistant professor in Purdue University.

 

The research materials produced in this project are used in teaching several graduate courses at University of Texas at Arlington and University of Pittsburgh.

"The expansion of scientific knowledge is continually improving human understanding of the brain and other biological systems.  Increasingly, however, it is becoming clear that many of the capacities of the brain arise from rich and complex interactions among its many regions.  Conversely, disorders of the brain and body often arise from subtle deficits that gradually impair the coordinated function of these interacting neural and biological systems until, at last, they begin to collapse and major symptoms are expressed.  Because these networks of interactions are too complex to simply intuit, scientists construct computer models so that the work of many different scientific studies can be brought together and gradually constructed into a unified understanding of the intricate systems under study.  This leads to broader understandings of our complex brains and bodies that would not be possible without such quantitative models.  The goal of the Myriad project is to provide a software platform for biological modeling that makes it much easier to harness the power of modern parallel-processing computer systems.  A second goal is to implement a simulator that uses this platform to create detailed models of neurons and neural networks.   
 	 
Myriad is a compartmental simulator platform based on a shared-memory architecture and designed for computational speed based on NVIDIA GPU (CUDA) or parallel CPU execution.  Its transformative potential arises from its capacity to automatically parallelize any compartmental model, including those with dense analogue interactions that presently cannot be effectively parallelized, and without requiring the end user to write special, platform-specific parallelization code. Myriad's shared-memory design eschews message-passing, and utilizes a radically granular design approach that flattens hierarchically defined cellular models and can even break up individual isometric compartments by state variable.  Specifically, all models that can be represented as isometric, stateful nodes (compartments) connected by any number of arbitrary mechanisms can be simulated with a high degree of parallelism, automatically thread-scaled to the number of available threads and load-balanced with very fine granularity to maximize the utilization of available CPU or GPU cores.  Programmatically, end-user models are defined in a Python-based environment and converted into fully-specified C99 code (for CPU or GPU) via code generation techniques that are enhanced by a custom abstract syntax tree (AST) translator and, for NVIDIA GPUs, a custom object specification for CUDA enabling fully on-card execution.  The first applications of Myriad will be to simulate biophysically realistic computational models of neurons and networks.  Importantly, however, Myriad's generic compartmental solver will be able in principle to parallelize any model framework that can be represented as stateful nodes coupled pairwise by arbitrary mechanisms.  Accordingly, to extend Myriad into new scientific areas of study (e.g., gene regulatory networks, epidemiological models, host-virus interactions, ecological systems) will require development only at the higher Python-based software layer, presumably by experts in the relevant field.  Finally, as present parallelization strategies are only able to accelerate sparselycoupled models, computational modeling recently has been drawn towards that subset of scientific questions capable of being addressed by these methods.  The release of Myriad may reopen the full breadth of quantitative biological questions that can be effectively addressed by parallel simulation.  Updates on the Myriad project can be found at http://cplab.net/myriad.

Our initial efforts were to develop the simulator from scratch, but with the growing availability and performance of GPU-aware machine learning frameworks like PyTorch we shifted our strategy to make use of these developments.  Specifically, we wrote a model design framework for neuronal and neuromorphic networks, now called Sapicore, that is layered atop PyTorch but bypasses some of its higher-level methods (applicable to deep networks), instead adapting it to serve the dissimilar needs of biologically inspired neuronal and neuromorphic network modeling. 

The intellectual merit of this project centers around the need for tools that support the current generation of brain-inspired modeling.  This includes both computational neuroscience modeling, for purposes of better understanding the brain and its function, and neuromorphic modeling, a growing field within artificial intelligence that seeks to use brain-inspired networks in artificial systems.  Compared with the presently-dominant deep network methods, neuromorphic networks are more task-specific, learn more rapidly and flexibly, and when deployed on compatible hardware are much, much more energy-efficient.  However, they are constrained by our nascent understanding of how such decentralized networks can be most efficiently programmed for purpose.  Ascertaining the mechanisms of well-characterized brain networks, and adapting them for purpose in artificial systems, is an effective approach to this early-stage problem.  Our Sapicore framework serves this strategy. 

The broader impacts of this project include the open-source and freely-distributable software package Sapicore.  Sapicore is distributed via PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/sapicore/); its source code is freely available at http://github.com/cplab/sapicore, and programmer documentation is available at https://cplab.github.io/sapicore/index.html.

"In closely related animal species, differences in patterns of growth and development are often responsible for differences in adult anatomy. This doctoral dissertation project will study cranial anatomy in a number of primate species, taking into account trajectories of growth and development, and use those data to reconstruct the growth and development trajectories of ancestral species. The project will advance knowledge about primate adaptation and life history, and will also generate novel shape measurement tools for studying growth, development and anatomy that will be useful across a number of biological disciplines. Undergraduate students will participate in the processing and analysis of shape measurements, thereby teaching them technical skills in geometric morphometrics, mathematics, and statistical analysis. The project will also support public science outreach activities to share these biological concepts and methodological advances with a broader audience. 

The objective of this investigation is to examine how evolution has shaped craniofacial growth and development to produce the morphological diversity observed in catarrhines. Geometric morphometric methods will be used to measure an ontogenetic cranial series of 26 extant catarrhine species, from which trajectories of ontogenetic shape change will be calculated. To address ancestral morphologies, this project will reconstruct the cranial ontogenetic trajectory of the last common ancestor (LCA) of all extant catarrhines, as well as those of the LCA of cercopithecoids, hominoids, and hominins, allowing for a comparison of ancestral trajectories with those of extant taxa. As adult morphologies are largely the product of patterns of growth and development, these ancestral ontogenetic trajectories will be used to make determinations about the cranial shapes of adult catarrhine ancestors. This project will also address the role of cranial size in the production of adult morphologies through an evaluation of the hypothesis of size as a 'line of least evolutionary resistance,' whereby size changes may be a first step in adaptation and diversification, with size responding more quickly than shape to environmental change. Using the latest advances in phylogenetic comparative methods, this hypothesis will be tested through direct comparisons of vectors of ontogenetic shape change in the catarrhine skull, and by examining the catarrhine phylogeny for rate shifts in the evolution of cranial size and in cranial size-shape relationships.

The aims of this dissertation project necessitated a balance of a large number of species from multiple age groups, requiring a targeted approach of visiting multiple museums with large enough sample sizes. From these museums, a total of 1,397 specimens from 31 species of primates were collected, which exceeded the projected collection goal by ~400 specimens. After the data were collected, they needed to be processed so that they would be suitable for analysis. Undergraduate students were incorporated in this data processing, which taught them technical skills in data management of large datasets, mathematics, and statistical software. The collection and analysis of these data resulted in the successful completion of a doctoral dissertation and the awarding of a Ph.D. degree in biological anthropology.

            This project advances our understanding of primate evolution, and the role of growth and development in producing cranial shape differences among species. One of the key findings of this research was the falsification of a long held hypothesis that differences in skull shape between closely related primate species are due mostly to differences in body size. The large sample collected with these funds was used to demonstrate that this interpretation is too simplistic, and that natural selection on cranial shapes themselves (rather than on body size alone) is likely to be shaping the cranial anatomy of humans and their closest relatives. This research has also demonstrated that adult cranial shape is not solely determined from the cranial shapes of juveniles, that is, the pattern in which the cranium develops plays a crucial role in the production of adult cranial shapes. This has important implications for future studies of primate evolution because it demonstrates that the analysis of shape changes associated with growth and development can provide evidence for how differences in adult cranial shapes are accomplished. These results have been presented at national conferences (the American Association of Physical Anthropologists annual meetings), and are currently being prepared for publication in order to disseminate these results more widely. Once this investigation is published (projected submission for publication date: July, 2019), the cranial data will be made available to researchers who request them, and shared on PRIMO, the NYCEP Primate Morphology database (http://www.nycep.org/primo), to make them widely available (anticipated date of upload to PRIMO: late 2019). Additional publications are also in preparation, which will use the novel shape measurement tools for studying growth that were developed for this project in order to identify the characteristics of ancestral primate skull shape. This will further our understanding of the processes responsible for the evolution of the primate skull.

"Age-at-death estimation is central to bioarchaeological and forensic research, for reconstructing past population demographics and for narrowing down the identity of individuals from their unidentified remains. Recent advances in genetics have led to the identification of DNA methylation markers that change with age and could be used in new methods of age prediction, but generally using tissue types that are not always available in archaeological and forensic contexts. In this doctoral dissertation project, samples of human bone across a range of known ages will be analyzed to determine regions of the genome that change most reliably with age. These data will be used to develop a method of predicting an individual's age from their bones, which may show different patterns of methylation compared with other tissue types. The protocol and algorithms used in this project will be made freely available online, and the project will support graduate and undergraduate training and research in a STEM discipline.

While age-associated changes in DNA methylation are well known in the field of epigenetics, most research conducted so far has been in blood and saliva tissues that can be easily obtained from living individuals. DNA methylation patterns are known to differ significantly between tissue types, and epigenetic age prediction models developed for a particular tissue type cannot be automatically applied to another. Therefore, in order to extend the applicability of DNA methylation-based age prediction to forensic contexts, more research on specific forensically relevant tissues is necessary. In this project, the researchers will first generate a genome-wide DNA methylation dataset from human bone collected through a body donation program. DNA will be extracted from these bone samples and their DNA methylation levels will be measured at over 850,000 sites across the genome using a commercially available array. This dataset will be analyzed statistically to identify specific regions of the genome that vary in a strong, predictable manner with age. The DNA methylation patterns at these regions will be used to develop a statistical model that can accurately estimate chronological age. Finally, a protocol to target and measure methylation levels at only these highly age-associated genomic regions will be developed, which will allow the age estimation method to be applied at a much lower cost

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,SUNY at Stony Brook,NY,31514,1753951,brenna.henn@stonybrook.edu,Brenna,Henn,1,"The goal of this project was to develop a new method of estimating age at death from skeletal remains by using DNA extracted from bone. Most methods currently employed by forensic scientists rely on specific physical features of the bones or teeth, which indicate how far along the individual was in their development in order to estimate how old they were when they died. However, this class of methods can be difficult to apply consistently, and they tend to be less useful for estimating adult age precisely, since most skeletal development processes are complete by early adulthood. In this project, we explored a molecular method of estimating human age based on DNA methylation. DNA methylation is a chemical modification to the DNA structure that has been shown to exhibit certain characteristic patterns of change with age.

We extracted DNA from bone samples of 42 different deceased people of known age and measured DNA methylation at over 800,000 different sites across the entire genome. Our samples were drawn from two different contexts; the first were recently deceased individuals who donated their bodies to Stony Brook University, SUNY for anatomy courses, while the second were individuals who has donated their bodies to the Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State (FACTS) for forensic research, and were exposed to natural processes of degradation outdoors for 2-3 years. While we successfully obtained high quality DNA methylation from the Stony Brook University donations, we found that the outdoor forensic specimens were highly degraded and levels of DNA methylation could not be reliably measured. We combined our new dataset with publicly available bone methylation data, and used this information to develop a statistical model to estimate age. Overall, the individuals we studied ranged in age from 49 to 112 years. We found that using measures of DNA methylation from 50 distinct regions of the genome, we could estimate individual age within 8.8 years.

Previous research has developed age estimation models using DNA methylation for other tissues, such as blood, saliva, and brain, but very little attention had been paid to tissues like bone that can survive intact well after an individual has passed away. Compared to a previously published DNA methylation-based age prediction method, we demonstrate that even more accurate estimates of chronological age can be generated for human bone from 7-fold fewer genomic sites. The results of our project demonstrate that DNA methylation-based age estimation is possible for bone. With a statistical model such as the one we developed, these techniques coudl be applied to a variety of important real-world cases. For example, forensics departments all over the country are routinely tasked with identifying deceased persons based on skeletal remains. With more accurate methods, such as that developed through this project, the process of investigating missing persons cases is likely to become more streamlined and are more successful. The post-mortem DNA damage in our forensic samples does, however, highlight several practical considerations related to the application of any method that relies on good-quality DNA, including preservation and the type of bone chosen.

"The population history of First Nations people cannot be fully understood without knowing the genetic effects of European colonization, including whether these effects differed for indigenous men versus women. In this doctoral dissertation project, the student co-PI will study a population of First Nations people through time by comparing DNA diversity of contemporary community members to those of their ancestors from archaeological sites. Using both maternal (mitochondrial) and paternal (Y-chromosome) DNA for modern and ancient samples will provide information on the genetic diversity and structure before and after European colonization and identify effects that differed for males and females. This project will support graduate student training and mentoring, including experience as teaching assistants for the genomic lab portion of the SING (Summer internship for INdigenous peoples in Genomics) workshop where indigenous peoples learn how to use genomics as a tool and form a network of indigenous scientists. Using a community based approach, this project completes research in a collaborative way with indigenous communities, resulting in more accurate information and enhanced scholarship. 

Researchers have speculated about the demographic effects of European colonization, the population genetic structure of Native Americans pre-contact, the amount of European admixture and the estimates of the number of indigenous Americans present pre-contact. It has been difficult to quantify these demographic changes because there are no published datasets with large numbers of ancient individuals and their descendants. In this project, mitochondrial and Y-chromosome DNA data will be combined with existing archaeological information and documented oral histories to infer the effects of European Colonization on males and females in the ancient Prince Rupert Harbour (PRH) population and modern descendants. The researchers hypothesize that the effects of European colonization will be greater for men than women because of differences in activity patterns and admixture.  The large sample size present in the PRH population, in addition to the long-term continual habitation in the coastal area, provides a unique dataset to use as comparative data for other researchers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,IL,31168,1751424,malhi@illinois.edu,Ripan,Malhi,1,"This project generated and provided DNA data on approximately 100 ancient individuals from a community prior to European Contact in North America. The ancient DNA data was compared to DNA data from present-day descendant individuals to learn about the biological impacts of European colonization on Indigenous peoples. A major outcome of the project is that overall, a major loss of DNA variation from the ancient community, prior to European contact, was identified compared to the present-day descendant community. Along with historical records, this is interpreted as a result of warfare and impacts of disease on Indigenous peoples as a result of European colonialism. In addition, Y-chromosomes identified as belonging to Indigenous males in the ancient community, prior to European contact, were either lost or replaced with Y-chromosomes belonging to males of European descent in the present-day Indigenous community. This is likely the result of European males replacing Indigenous males as a result of European colonialism in the genetic pool of the present-day Indigenous community.  

This project also trained a graduate student with an interdisciplinary focus including the life sciences and social sciences. The student was specifically trained in molecular biology and bioinformatic techniques and analyses as well as community-based methods. The student received her PhD, increasing the number of female scientists in STEM fields, and is currently a postdoctoral fellow at an academic institution.

"Addressing the food needs of an increasing global population in the 21st century will require significant improvements in agriculture akin to the Green Revolution of the previous century. To address this goal it is of critical importance to understand as much as possible about the functions of the tens of thousands of genes present in each plant species, in order to select those functions of most relevance to engineering favorable traits such as drought tolerance or increased grain quality.  Much of what is currently known about plant gene function comes from experiments in model plant systems such as Arabidopsis thaliana, but because of evolutionary relatedness this information can be used to predict the functions of genes in crop species such as maize and rice, and to provide targeted hypotheses that can be followed up by further experiments.  This project will increase both the efficiency and accuracy of gene function prediction in plants by organizing and integrating high quality data from a number of sources and presenting it in a user-friendly format that makes clear the evolutionary relationships between genes.  The team will develop software for visualizing the evolutionary relationships as a gene family tree, providing an organizing framework for disparate experimental observations from a number of experimental systems.  The project will provide software for use, and for data sharing, by a broad community of both researchers and students.  The project?s inclusion of local community college students will provide training and increase participation in computer science, genomics and plant biology by groups that are underrepresented in these fields.

The project output will be a powerful and intuitive software tool for inferring plant gene function from phylogenetic relationships and experimental evidence.  To achieve this goal the project aims are to: 1) assemble sets of phylogenetic trees using selected model organism and plant genomes, along with a suite of web services to ensure easy access to the data; 2) follow user-driven design principles to design and build the user interface, in order to visualize the phylogenetic trees and associate the genes within each tree with high quality functional information including Gene Ontology annotations, gene expression patterns, protein domains, sequence variations and mutant phenotypes; 3) provide an analysis platform that streamlines workflows and includes personal workspaces for users to add their own data and make it public when their work is completed, thus enriching the knowledgebase; and 4) produce workshops, course materials and online content to train scientists at all academic levels on how to use the software. The results of the project will be available at http://www.phoenixbioinformatics.org/treevision/.",NSF,Phoenix Bioinformatics Corporation,CA,1261211,1661543,huala@phoenixbioinformatics.org,Eva,Huala,1,"One of the great challenges facing modern biology is understanding the  rules of life, more specifically understanding the sets of rules that  predict an organism's observable characteristics that together make up  its phenotype.  We have built a new online resource, PhyloGenes, for  integration and display of plant gene function information on  precomputed phylogenetic trees for gene families spanning 40 plant  species and 10 non-plant model species.   PhyloGenes enables researchers  to observe and understand the evolution of gene function within these  gene families, which in turn underlies the observable physical traits  that distinguish one plant species from another.  Additionally, this new  online resource enables the translation of knowledge gleaned from the  study of model species to other species that may be more difficult to  study directly.  We aim to make it easier to use knowledge from model  species to understand the function of genes that control traits in other  plant species, including crops like corn, rice, soybean, wheat and  cotton as well as other species that can help us understand the  evolution of plants because of their position in the species tree.
 
 PhyloGenes contains information about 8,519 gene families containing  1,259,624 genes. We display information about experimentally determined  gene functions for 34,495 of these genes from 5,989 gene families, and  another 541,974 genes from 3,679 families are shown with functions that  are predicted based on their evolutionary relationship to genes that  have been studied. Each gene family page in PhyloGenes is composed of a  gene tree on the left, with speciation and gene duplication nodes  clearly indicated. These nodes can be collapsed or expanded, and trees  can be customized to display only the desired species. To the right of  the tree, gene function data are presented in rows aligned with the  genes in the tree. Experimentally validated gene functions are presented  as GO terms with evidence codes and literature citations. The function  panel display can be customized to show only the desired information and  can be swapped with a multiple sequence alignment with conserved  residues highlighted and each sequence aligned to the corresponding gene  within the tree. We have also provided a tool that allows a user to add  proteins from other species to see where they map within the PhyloGenes  trees and infer their function based on what is known about related  genes.

"The rapid expansion of massively-parallel sequencing (MPS, or ""next-generation sequencing"") technology has revolutionized molecular microbial ecology by making the detailed analysis of complex communities over time and space a tractable research pursuit for small research groups. While the advent of MPS methods has allowed microbial ecologists to ask meaningful questions with ever-greater precision, it brings significant challenges to individual small laboratories struggling to manage megabytes or even gigabytes of data. This project will sustain the web service VAMPS (Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures, http://vamps.mbl.edu), which removes the need for individual research groups to make the considerable investment in computational infrastructure and bioinformatic support otherwise necessary to process, analyze, and interpret MPS data for microbial ecology. VAMPS is a free, open-source database-driven website that allows researchers using MPS data to analyze the diversity of microbial communities and the relationships between communities, to explore these analyses in an intuitive visual context, and to download analyses and images for publication. Any web-capable device can be used to upload, process, explore, and extract data and results from VAMPS, and the VAMPS development team is available to assist in all aspects of data processing and analysis. VAMPS encourages researchers to share sequence and metadata, and fosters collaboration between researchers of disparate biomes who recognize common patterns in shared data. VAMPS currently hosts more than 200 projects encompassing more than 5000 datasets and over 250 million sequence tags, is used by nearly 1000 investigators from around the world, and has supported at least 15 NSF-funded projects. VAMPS provides unique educational opportunities through its combination of data from a variety of environments, its integration of sequence cluster-based and taxonomy-based analytical and visualization tools, and the instruction provided by project developers.

VAMPS is designed for visualization, exploration, and analysis of amplicon tag data in a comparative context. Sequence data and associated metadata can be uploaded directly by users or by sending data to the VAMPS project team; MPS reads can be automatically quality filtered and assigned to both taxonomic structures and to taxonomic-independent clusters. These can then be linked to metadata and compared using a wide variety of analytical and visualization tools. Each result is extensively hyperlinked to other analysis and visualization options, promoting data exploration and leading to a greater understanding of data relationships. A major strength of VAMPS is that researchers can compare not only datasets within their own projects but can compare these with datasets from projects such as NSF-funded Long Term Ecological Research projects, the International Census of Marine Microbes, the Human Microbiome Project, and hundreds of other individual projects. The project will support: 1) Active releases of QIIME, OTU clustering methods, oligotyping, and other methods as authors release new versions. 2) A VAMPS administrator to support users in uploading and trimming data and the use of the many VAMPS visualization and analysis tools, exporting data for other analytical methods and images for publication, and facilitating collaborations and adding new portals. 3) Incorporation of new publicly available data. Projects of particular interest include the Earth Microbiome Project, the American Gut Project, and Terra Oceans that have or will have data that would benefit the research community if made available through VAMPS. 4) Adapting analysis capabilities to other appropriate genes as requested by the community. 5) Hardware and software maintenance and data storage.

The ability to generate 107 reads from 100 samples for a single project with relative ease brings with it many downstream complications.  Beyond the computational resources and skills needed to analyze data, it is difficult to compare datasets, which may represent spatial or temporal gradients, changes to a community in response to nutrients or stress, or the response of a biota to its host, in an intuitive and interactive manner that leads to hypothesis generation.

This project sustained the web service VAMPS (Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures, http://vamps.mbl.edu).  VAMPS is a free, open-source database-driven website that allows researchers using data from massively-parallel sequencing (MPS, or ""next-generation sequencing"") projects to analyze the diversity of microbial communities and the relationships between communities, to explore these analyses in an intuitive visual context, and to download analyses and images for publication.

Key outcomes of the award include:

1. Conversion from the original VAMPS website (vamps.mbl.edu) to VAMPS2 (vamps2.mbl.edu).  VAMPS2 uses node.js code design refactoring for improved maintainability, modularity, and portability.  The speed of real-time analyses is significantly improved over VAMPS, particularly the ability to analyze many datasets simultaneously.  The new user interface represents considerable input from our many users and includes the ability to more easily manage multiple visual analyses, the ability to save projects (sets of datasets and taxonomies), and the ability to select between alternate taxonomies. 

2. Extensive search and selection options to navigate the 1,000+ projects and 200,000+ datasets in VAMPS2.  Users can:

    a) select projects or datasets by owner (user), portal, name, partial name, or key word;

    b) select datasets based on metadata criteria, environmental source, or amplicon target;

    c) select datasets over a specified geographic range;

    d) find all datasets containing a designated taxon;

    e) find all occurrences of a sequence or similar sequence using BLAST.

3.  Creation of ten data portals for ""meta projects"" including the Coral Microbiome Project; the Census of Deep Life; the Human Microbiome Project; the International Census of Marine Microbes; Microbial Inventory Research Across Diverse Aquatic Long Term Ecological Research Sites; Microbiology of Built Environments; and the Plastisphere.  

4. Improved data submission tools, including Django API for sequence and metadata cleaning and confirmation.

5. Extensive improvements to the VAMPS2 database, including switching database code to MariaDB, removing obsolete tables, cleaning data and data structures, and extensive normalization.  This has resulted in improved response times despite a drastic increase in database size.

6. The new VAMPS2 database can store metagenomic data (ie data is not constrained to regions of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene).  This represents a significant advance in our goal to expand VAMPS services.  In addition to multiple regions of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic samll subunit amplicon target regions we have added as proof of principle ITS1 and more than 30 fungal ITS1 datasets.  Development of new tools to fully analyze metagenomic data is outside the objectives and resources of this project but will be pursued by other means.

7. The VAMPS database can be accessed directly via API using instructions available here: https://github.com/hsosik/MBVL/tree/master/prototypes/vamps_api_interaction

At the conclusion of the project, VAMPS contained records of more than 430 million unique sequences representing more than 6 billion amplicon reads, from nearly 215 thousand datasets organized in more than a thousand different projects.  

Each year of the award hundreds of new users registered to use VAMPS.  In addition to project leads submitting data to the site this includes dozens of users per project that use the site to collaboratively analyze their data.  Beyond these, more than a hundred new users each year register to use publicly available data for research and education.  Portals to metaprojects such as ""the human microbiome"" or ""the plastisphere"" facilitate the use of VAMPS as an educational tool. 

VAMPS has been used in the MBL Advanced Training Course STAMPS (Strategies and Techniques for the Analysis of Microbial Population Structure), which trains ~60 graduate students, postdocs, and PIs each year in methods of metagenomic sequence analysis. 

VAMPS is used in the University of Chicago undergraduate course Microbes Across Environments, taught every fall at the MBL since 2017.  VAMPS is particularly effective in introducing non-majors and others without extensive bioinformatic training to concepts of microbial community analysis.

Beginning in early 2020, the MBL began a program of immersion experiences for secondary school students.  VAMPS was used as an easily accessible tool for microbial community analysis that required no computational experience.  Though this program has been curtailed by the pandemic we expect it to continue and for VAMPS to be a critical tool in the microbiome component.

"Comparative analyses of DNA and amino acid sequences is a powerful paradigm in biology, including evolution, ecology, development, and medicine. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software is a widely used tool to apply state-of-the-art methods for sequence analysis in these biological disciplines. MEGA provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to enable researchers to explore their primary data and results interactively, along with an integrated analytical engine that makes a large repertoire of evolutionary analysis methods easily accessible. MEGA is used by thousands of researchers in biology and has become a major teaching tool in universities worldwide. However, MEGA is primarily for use on Windows operating systems, which limits its utility and impact. The goal of this project is to (a) make MEGA cross-platform; (b) ready MEGA for community contributions and third-party expansion of functionalities; and (c) add a workflow GUI in MEGA to enable researchers to assemble pipelines and workflows that are becoming essential for rigorous, reproducible, and automated analytics in this era of big data. These developments will lead to a major enhancement of software infrastructure in biology and related interdisciplinary areas, all of which are critical in modern biological research. They will advance education through the development of tutorials, and benefit underserved populations through workshops and teaching. 

Comparative analyses of DNA and amino acid sequences, a powerful paradigm in computational biology, have grown and adapted to the changing needs of biological sciences. Due to its increasing analytical complexity, successful application of the comparative paradigm requires efficient, sophisticated, and intuitive software. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA, now in version 7) software is among the most widely used tools for sequence analysis, as it provides a powerful and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), giving researchers tools for exploring their data and visualizing results interactively, and placing a large repertoire of state-of-the-art evolutionary analysis methods at their fingertips. This ""Development"" proposal is to modernize and re-engineer MEGA using cutting edge software libraries and development philosophies. It will ensure that this vital community resource not only remains useful for the next decade, but also becomes cross-platform and extensible for community integration of new methods and tools. The project will leverage modern open source application development stacks and libraries, drawing upon web technologies (JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS) for a platform agnostic application, which will lead to an open source, cross-platform MEGA GUI that is ready for community contributions and third-party expansion of functionalities. It will also add a new workflow system (AppFlows) to enable researchers to assemble pipelines and workflows that are becoming essential for rigorous, reproducible, and automated analytics in this era of big data. The new AppDepot in MEGA will host add-ins and extensions (small and large) developed by community programmers by reusing MEGA-X components and core libraries. AppDepot will bridge the gap between computational/statistical method developers and biological users, as the large installed base of MEGA will immediately make new methods available to many to test and use. All of these results will be available from www.megasoftware.net .",NSF,Temple University,PA,998419,1661218,s.kumar@temple.edu,Sudhir,Kumar,1,"Analysis of DNA and amino acid sequences has become common in many fields in biological sciences. These analyses require computer software that is intuitive and efficient. The MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) software makes a large repertoire of state-of-the-art analytical methods available to researchers in a powerful and intuitive tool that enables data exploration and visualizations interactively. In this software-engineering project, we successfully transformed MEGA from a Windows-only software to one that is now available for use on macOS and Linux operating systems. The project also expanded the collection of analytical methods and made all methods more computationally efficient, allowing for bigger data analytics on a desktop computer. Major new and improved versions of MEGA were disseminated annually, with versions with minor updates released more frequently. During the grant period (2017-2021), MEGA was downloaded &gt;500,000 times by researchers from a very large number of institutions and countries. MEGA use was cited in more than &gt;60,000 research articles, spanning &gt;100 fields in biological sciences. The broader impact of MEGA in education was also extensive, as MEGA was downloaded over 1 million times by students. An expanded wider impact was realized through our teaching-related articles that introduced MEGA and related resources to K-12 and undergraduate students and teachers. Overall, this project led to major enhancements of software infrastructure in biology and related interdisciplinary areas, all of which are critical in modern biological research and education.

"Understanding how gene by environment interactions result in specific phenotypes is a core goal of modern biology and has real-world impacts on such things as crop management. Developing and managing successful crop practices is a goal that is fundamentally tied to our national food security. By applying novel computational visual analytical methods, this project seeks to identify and unravel the complex web of interactions linking genotypes, environments and phenotypes. These methods will first need to be designed and developed into usable software applications that can handle large volumes of crop phenomics data. High-throughput sensing technologies collect large volumes of field data for many plant traits, such as flowering time, related to crop development and production. The maize cultivars used here come from multiple genotypes that have been grown under a variety of environmental conditions, in order to give the widest range of conditions for understanding the interactions. The resulting data sets are growing quickly, both in size and complexity, but the analytical tools needed to extract knowledge and catalyze scientific discoveries have significantly lagged behind. The methodologies to be developed in this project represent a systematic attempt at bridging this rapidly widening divide. The project is inherently interdisciplinary, involving close research partnerships among computer scientists, plant scientists, and mathematicians. The research outcomes will be tightly integrated with education using a multipronged approach that includes, among others, postdoctoral and student training (graduates and undergraduates), curriculum development for a new campus-wide interdisciplinary undergraduate degree in Data Analytics, conference tutorials for training phenomics data practitioners, and contribution to the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities (particularly women) in STEM fields through the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.


This project will lead to the design and development of a new, scalable, visual analytics platform suitable for hypothesis extraction and refinement from complex phenomics data sets. Focus on hypothesis extraction is critical in the context of phenomics data sets because much of the high-throughput sensing data being generated in crop fields are generated in the absence of specifically formulated hypotheses. Extracting plausible hypotheses from the data represents an important but tedious task. To this end, this project will apply and develop new capabilities using emerging advanced algorithmic principles, particularly from the branch of mathematics called algebraic topology that studies shapes and structure of complex data. The research objectives are three-fold. First, the project will employ and extend emerging algorithmic techniques from algebraic topology to decode the structure of large, complex phenomics data. Second, an interactive visual analytic platform will be developed to facilitate knowledge discovery using the extracted topological structures. Lastly, the quality and validity of a new visual analytic platform designed by this team will be tested using real-world maize data sets as well as simulated inputs as testbeds. The developed framework will encode functions for scientists to delineate hypotheses of three kinds: i) genetic characterization of single complex traits; ii) genetic characterization of multiple traits that share potentially pleiotropic effects; and iii) decoding and detailed characterization of genotype-by-environmental interactions, in particular, through a collaborative pilot study of maize flowering and growth traits. The expected significance of the proposed work is that biologists will be able to extract different types of testable hypotheses from plant phenomics data sets by employing a new class of visual analytic tools, and thus obtain a deeper understanding of the interactions among genotypes, environments and phenotypes. The project is potentially transformative in two ways: i) it will introduce advanced mathematical and computational principles into mainstream phenomic data analysis; and ii) it will usher in a new era where biologists spearhead data-driven hypothesis extraction and discovery with the aid of interactive, informative, and intuitive tools. The project will have a direct impact on the state of software in phenomics for fundamental data-driven discovery. To facilitate broader community adoption, the project will integrate the tools into the CyVerse Institute, and to a community phenomics software outlet. It will also lead to the development of automated scientific workflows. Project website: http://tdaphenomics.eecs.wsu.edu/",NSF,Washington State University,WA,761428,1661348,ananth@eecs.wsu.edu,Anantharaman,Kalyanaraman,1,"The project represents the first concrete demonstration of topological data analysis for plant phenomics data. Topological data analysis is one of the emerging mathematical principles with a wide range of real-world applications. The project was able to successfully demonstrate how topological data analysis can be used to analyze plant phenomics data sets and help in extracting different types of hypotheses relating to how different genotypes (crop varieties) interact with various environmental variables (e.g., temperature, humidity) to effect certain key phenotypic traits (e.g., plant height, growth rate). The project also demonstrated, through application on real-world data sets, that this interaction is not all the same, and that there is tremendous diversity in the way to different genotypes interact with different environmental variables.

 

From a computational standpoint, the project’s developments contributed to the mathematical and algorithmic foundations in topological data analysis, including in data modeling, feature extraction, hypothesis formulation, and interactive visualization. It created an open source software toolkit for complex multi-dimensional data sets that have become a feature in multiple data-driven domains.

 

The project led to the training of multiple graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdocs, on various interdisciplinary topics at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and biology and life sciences.

"With support from the Advances in Biological Informatics in the Division of Biological Infrastructure, Professor Bryan Carstens and his research group at the Ohio State University will further develop the P2M2 software package, so that it can better estimate how multiple events may shape population genetics. Most of the differences among living organisms ultimately can be traced to genetic variation, including humans. Patterns of genetic differences in a species appear across different groups, due to events such as changes in population size, migration between populations, or long periods of isolation. Understanding, for example, how beneficial mutations can be established in a natural population of a certain size that has migration limits is important for understanding aspects of human health, conservation genetics, breeding in agriculture and many other research areas.  Recent technological advances have made it fast and inexpensive to obtain genetic sequences from many individuals, assuming samples can be collected. A number of software packages provide models that estimate what prior events looked like from current genetic data, including biological parameters such as population size or migration rate. However, each assumes a particular mathematic model of population demography and are limited to estimating parameters from a subset of the biological processes that may influence genetic variation. A poor match between the assumptions of the analytical model and the true population history will produce inaccurate parameter estimates that are likely to mislead the biological inference. This project will develop software that enables biologists to assess how appropriate a particular software package is to a given set of genetic data. Therefore, it will benefit society by improving the quality of biological inferences drawn from genetic data, ranging from efforts to protect endangered species to investigations into the history of viral pathogens.

Bayesian inference is commonly used to analyze genetic data because it provides a computationally efficient approach to identifying highly-probable regions of parameter space, but all such inference is conditional on the models chosen to use in the analysis. While analytical models exist that can estimate parameters associated with all population-level biological processes, such as genetic drift, phylogenetic divergence, gene flow, population size change, etc., computational limitations prevent any given analytical model of incorporating more than a handful of these processes. Biologists typically choose which analytical method to use intuitively, and generally lack approaches for assessing the absolute statistical fit of a model given the genetic data. Consequently, the inferences that result from the analysis of genetic data are effectively conditional on the appropriateness of the model used to analyze the data, although they are rarely presented in such terms. The proposed work will develop and implement a considerable expansion of the P2C2M R package, which currently implements posterior predictive simulation to assess the statistical fit of a single model - the multispecies coalescent model. The work will expand P2C2M such that the statistical fit of additional coalescent methods can be evaluated. By expanding P2C2M, the work promotes the consideration of model fit as an important step within the overall process of making biological inferences from genetic data. Biologists have devoted a great deal of energy to justify the models that they use to analyze their data using verbal reasoning and qualitative arguments, but have generally lacked the tools and statistical framework to do so in a direct quantitative manner. P2C2M will provide these tools by the time of project completion. As a direct consequence of the expanded P2C2M R package, the inferences made by evolutionary geneticists will be more insightful and because researchers and their audiences will have enhanced confidence in the choice of analytical models from which these inferences are derived. The work will enhance biological inferences with important societal benefit, such as the identification of cryptic species, understanding the demography of invasive species and disease vectors, and the movement of alleles across the landscape in endangered species. Updated project code will be available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/P2C2M/index.html and other supplemental information distributed at https://carstenslab.osu.edu/.",NSF,Ohio State University,OH,403649,1661029,carstens.12@osu.edu,Bryan,Carstens,1,"This project was concerned with understanding how biologists can best assess the statistical models that they use to analyze genetic data. While this may seem estoteric, genetic data form the basis for many biological inferences that are of practical importance, for example about species identification, the history of invasive species, and pathogen transmission. Because these analyses have potential real-world consequences, biologists need to be able to verify that the statistical model that they have chosen to do the data analysis is appropriate for the data that they are analyzing. This project explored a general strategy for conducting this verification known as posterior predictive simulation, and developed specific applications for different types of questions. We also established that certain questions are inherently challenging to this approach.

Much of the work conducted here involved statistical modelling and software development. In addition to the talks and papers that we produced for an audience of other scientists, there were multiple people trained as a function of this work. Some of these scientists are now in other academic positions as postdoctoral researchers or tenure track faculty, while others are in positions at hospitals or working for non-governmental conservation organizations. Regardless of their placement, the advanced training received by the personnel on this award represents an inherent benefit to society. Below some main outcomes are discussed:

1. One of the main outcomes of this project was the development of software that is intended to apply to certain types of use cases where biologists analyze genetic data. For example, genetic data are often applied to the question of species boundaries in groups where species are difficult to identify in visual ways. The P2C2M-GMYC R package offers an efficient protocol for verifying that the properties of the data are appropriate for this type of analysis. 

2. A second outcome was the development of a different R package, P2C2M SNAPP, which allows users to explore whether a phylogenetic model is appropriate to use for their data. This question is relevant because often times researchers are not able to identify species boundaries, and as such do not know whether their samples represent many populations within a widespread species or multiple independent species. 

3. A third type of outcome is synthesis of knowledge. The project also resulted in synthetic work that was intended to report on aspects of this project that did not directly result in software packages. For example, a manuscript published in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution summarized many findings for a technical audience and speculated on venues that future work might explore (i.g., https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(21)00342-6).

"This dissertation project is an investigation of genetic relationships among populations of Neotropical monkey species, to better understand how populations change over time and become different species. Specifically, the project will address species boundaries, patterns and consequences of hybridization, and how human impact on the environment affects species' persistence and movement through the landscape. This research will result in science-based tools for conservation managers, including the development of genetic tools to improve species management practices, the identification of potential locations for habitat corridors, and recommendations on how to maintain population viability in human-impacted environments. The project will provide numerous opportunities for student training, public science outreach and international research collaborations.

The blond capuchin monkey occurs in the Atlantic rainforest of northeastern Brazil, and given the extent of historic loss and fragmentation of this habitat, extant populations exist in relative isolation. The extent to which this fragmented landscape impacts the blond capuchin's genetic diversity is not known. Using a genomic approach, this study will (1) describe the evolutionary relationships among species in the robust capuchin lineage, (2) examine the presence of hybrid zones between capuchins of the northern Atlantic Forest and Caatinga habitats, and (3) contribute to our understanding of how human-modified habitats have affected primate genetic variation and population connectivity. This project addresses fundamental questions about speciation and population genetics and contributes to conservation efforts that require substantial knowledge of species' natural and evolutionary history.",NSF,University of Texas at Austin,TX,21685,1650844,anthony.difiore@austin.utexas.edu,Anthony,Di Fiore,1,"We used a genomic approach to investigate the evolutionary relationships, patterns of hybridization between the blond capuchin monkey and its congeners, and to examine the spatial genetic variation within and among populations of blond capuchins. The blond capuchin monkey is a Neotropical primate endemic to Atlantic Forest of Brazil, which is a highly fragmented and impacted environment, considered one of the hotspots of species diversity and endemicity. This ecosystem occupies less than 12% of its original extent and provides an ideal habitat to study the impact of fragmentation and anthropogenic factors on primate persistence and gene flow through the landscape. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Instituto Chico Mendes de Conserva&ccedil;&atilde;o da Biodiversidade (Chico Mendes Institute for Conservation of the Biodiversity, ICMBio/Brazil) have recently classified the blond capuchin monkey as Endangered (EN) due its small current geographic range and the steep reduction in population size it has experienced in the recent past. Because of its Atlantic Forest distribution, doubts on its evolutionary relationships with other capuchins, and the possible importance of ongoing natural and human-facilitated hybridization it is very important to conduct a broad genetic study that generates information to improve conservation actions for the species.

Our project aimed to use a genomic approach 1) to describe the evolutionary relationships and history of the capuchin monkeys of the northern Atlantic Forest and Caatinga biomes of Brazil; 2) to identify the presence of hybrids between the blond capuchin monkey and two of its congeners; and 3) to characterize the population structure of blond capuchin monkey populations living in an anthropogenically impacted landscape.

Towards this end, we obtained DNA samples from 250 individuals from the 8 known capuchin monkey species and discovered genetic markers throughout the genomes of individuals from nine populations of blond capuchin monkey, four populations of wild bearded capuchins, and two populations of wild yellow-breasted capuchins from deep within the geographic ranges of each of these species, as well as from 6 populations of capuchins in potential hybrid zones and of Amazonian capuchin monkeys. To date, we have standardized the use of a novel method for identifying and rapidly genotyping thousands of molecular markers throughout the genome of capuchins and have started to conduct the final bioinformatic analysis to address our research questions.

Our project has provided mentoring opportunities for nine undergraduate students from both Federal and State Universities in Paraiba, Brazil. All these undergraduate students received a broad training in ecological data collection, DNA extraction, and GIS software and analysis. Three of these students developed their final undergraduate thesis using data from the field expeditions. In addition, two students are being trained in statistical analysis and processing of genomic data using bioinformatics as we conduct the final analytical steps of this project.

Finally, one of the most important impacts of this project will be the generation of science-based recommendations for conservation managers on identifying potential areas for habitat corridors and on increasing our knowledge of the impacts and outcomes that decreasing connectivity and population fragmentation have on evolutionary and short-term genetic variation in primates. Therefore, our project contributes to the improvement of conservation actions outlined in the Conservation Action Plan (PAN-PRINE) for the threatened primates of northeastern Brazil, which was developed with the involvement of researchers, conservationists, agroindustry representatives, and local communities. One of the proposed actions is the development and maintenance of a habitat corridor in the Paraiba state of Brazil, and we are working with the PAN-PRINE committee to incorporate this project?s results and recommendations into the ongoing conservation plan.

An additional priority of this project was to support local community involvement in the conservation of the blond capuchin monkey. The involvement of local community has been reinforced through the delivery of conservation workshops in local schools, the distribution of banners and handouts with pictures of the threatened monkeys, and dissemination of information about their conservation to local jurisdictions. Additionally, members of local communities living near surveyed forest fragments were hired as field guides and trained to become field assistants, improving their knowledge and involvement in the conservation activities. Furthermore, we have presented the data on the standardization of the methods and results from field expeditions at national and international scientific meetings and have participated at local workshops to help improving conservation actions for the species.

"Many anatomical and physiological characteristics of modern humans are thought to have evolved through changes in the timing of early growth and development, and the mouse is a primary model organism for studying such changes. This dissertation project will develop more accurate methods for determining the developmental age of mice during embryogenesis and investigate changes in developmental timing that may have driven the evolution of anatomical features that separate modern humans from their closest relatives and ancestors. The age estimation methodology produced by this research will be integrated into a freely available, online staging tool. Research conducted within the scope of this project will also help to create opportunities for female undergraduate and high school students to gain valuable experience in data collection and analysis, and to present original research at local and national symposia.

The purpose of this research is to address long-standing questions about how changes in the timing of development, either in the rate, the onset time, or the offset time of the development of specific anatomical features during embryogenesis, affect adult morphology. Experimental systems provide a potentially illuminating context to address these questions, but the inability to estimate the relative developmental age of an embryo with precise temporal resolution remains a significant problem. This project will establish a staging system that will precisely estimate the relative development of an embryo in hours, an order of magnitude more precise than existing developmental staging systems. The method, which will estimate developmental ages between embryonic day 9 and embryonic day 15 (E9-E15) using only a photograph of the mouse hindlimb, represents an easy-to-implement tool that mitigates interobserver error. The staging system will then be used to determine the extent to which human-specific anatomy, such as the reduced projection of the face, is produced by a shift in developmental timing, by studying the rate and timing of developmental events in mice carrying mutations that simulate changes in facial anatomy that occurred in human evolution. The results of this research will provide valuable and necessary clarification of the relationships among genotype, phenotype, and timing of developmental events, producing innovative solutions to questions about the nature of human development.",NSF,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,31355,1650824,jta10@psu.edu,Joan,Richtsmeier,1,"A major aim of this project was to examine the historically based idea that humans resemble juvenile apes because they develop more slowly than their ape counterparts. We tested this using a novel experimental and laboratory mice that can be bred over relatively short periods of time. We used mice carrying a mutation that caused changes in shape and relative proportions of the head that resemble those that occured during human evolution (reduced projection of the face, rounded skull when viewed from above). We were able to show that mice whose heads changed in ways similar to shape changes seen in skulls during human evolution do not develop more slowly than their typically developing littermates. This suggests that the changes seen in human evolution do not require a reduced rate of development to occur.

In addition, we identified a genetic combination (the interaction of two genetic mutations) in one of our mouse strains that is associated with a decreased rate of development compared to their genetically normal littermates. This result is important because it shows that specific combinations of genetic mutations can alter the pace of developmental events, despite the fact that none of the individual mutations affect developmental timing in isolation.

To enable a test of changes in rate and timing of development we needed to develop a staging system that enabling the sorting of specimens according to their level of development. We produced a freely-available on-line tool to estimate the level of development of mouse embryos aged embryonic day 10-15 (E10-E15) called the embryonic Mouse Ontogenetic Staging System (eMOSS). This tool is designed to assist researchers by enabling them to order their specimens according to their level of development (that does not always correspond with chronological age), and also allows for comparisons between research projects done by different labs and/or projects using different strains of mice.

This research addresses a number of broader impacts. The major technical accomplishment of this research, the eMOSS staging system, is free for other researchers to use at https://limbstaging.embl.es/, providing a valuable tool for researchers working in developmental biology without imposing a financial burden on institutions with fewer financial resources. This project has also provided the opportunity for training of several female undergraduates in valuable research methods and project design, supporting the Richtsmeier Lab?s goal of enabling the early careers of female scientists. Images generated during this project have been used in presentations at several undergraduate classes at Penn State, and will be used in education presentations in primary and secondary educational settings as well.
