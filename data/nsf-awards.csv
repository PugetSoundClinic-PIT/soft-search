"The ability to record events (“memory”) is a crucial part of many complex systems. Recording events allows these systems to modify their behavior based on previous interactions, report on their history, or communicate local information to a global community. Biological systems will benefit greatly from the creation of memory elements. Biological memories in bacterial or mammalian cells could be used to monitor a person’s microbiome, develop smart materials that respond to the environment, or create specialized sensors that react to biotoxins. Biological memories in living cells themselves require a controlled environment. This environment not only ensures their long-term survival and viability but also allows for the controlled reading and writing of the memory. Reading and writing will ultimately be how these systems are “programmed” and how the data they collect can be acted upon. This project creates novel bio-memories using devices that move small amounts of liquids (microfluidics). Microfluidics are used to test in parallel many biological-memory configurations to determine which are the best at testing specific environmental signals (e.g. toxins, metals, hormones). The best of these memories are then integrated with low-cost, embedded electronics that can read their outputs as well as control the microfluidic environments housing the memories and allowing external signals to “write” information in the memories. Biological memories, microfluidics, and electronics together form what is called “Hybrid Bio-Electronic Microfluidic Memory Arrays”. These devices will explore numerous interdisciplinary challenges and create opportunities for exploring applications at the boundaries of computer science, synthetic biology, and materials science.  To maximize this project’s impact, all of the research including the microfluidic and electronics designs and software will be made open source. All genetic memory elements will be provided to the scientific community. More than 48 undergraduate students will be mentored during the project period via NSF sponsored programs and summer research programs at Boston University. 

This project has a three-phase structure, where in the first phase biological memories are developed with the aid of a high-throughput, electronically augmented microfluidic screening platform. Recombinase enzymatic reactions on DNA will act as the irreversible memories while epigenetic, chromatin modifications will act as the reversible mechanism. This phase will involve the creation of 1000’s of potential memory elements. In the second phase, the top candidates from the first phase are combined in a massively parallel, highly integrated microfluidics platform to develop the eventual deployed microfluidic as well as establishing the operating and control conditions needed for the memories. Finally, in phase three, a small-scale deployment environment is created to observe and tune the performance of the newly created Hybrid Bio-Electronic Microfluidic Memory Arrays in an aquatic deployment scenario meant to replicate real-world bio-sensing applications for heavy metals and other environmental signals. These phases explicitly address three bio-memory challenges (create, control, and deploy) using state-of-the-art biological reversible and irreversible memories, droplet microfluidics, and customized embedded semiconductor-based electronics.

"Nontechnical Abstract:
The electrical systems that living organisms employ for bio- computations, such as sensing, intelligent responsiveness, and adaptation, require much less power than currently available man-made electronic systems. This project is developing ultralow-power electronic components and systems for signal retrieval, processing, and storage with power consumption comparable to biological systems. The project takes a fundamentally new approach to improving computing efficiency and storage capacity that can form the basis for self-sustained living or hybrid micro-electronic systems. These electronics that have power requirements similar to biology can naturally interface with biological systems, which is important for potential applications in brain-mimic computation, self-sustained microbots, advanced human-machine interfaces, and prosthetics. The interdisciplinary nature of the research provides an excellent platform for outreach and broadening participation in STEM education.
 
Technical Abstract:
Bioinspired electronics, such as sensing, computing, and memory devices, have generated substantial interest because of their potential high efficiency in information retrieval, processing, and storage. Although functional emulation of biological systems has led to many emerging high-performance electronic devices, there is a fundamental difference in the signal amplitude and power requirements. Biological signal processing, such as sensory detection, neural computation, and memory consolidation, uses action potentials (50-100 mV) that approach the thermodynamic limit, whereas conventional electronic systems function with much higher amplitude (> 0.5 V). As a result, the functional emulation of biosystems has not yet reached the ultralow-power information processing found in biosystems, ultimately limiting the integration density or capacity of computation and storage. The goal of the project is to investigate mechanisms and integrate principles in synthetic materials, electronics, and biology to realize computing devices, memory, and sensors that can function at biological-power levels. Borrowing materials and principles from microbes, the general method is to develop hybrid electronic materials, components, and systems. The research team employs specific approaches including: (i) harnessing catalytic principles in microbial systems to lower the functional voltage in electronics, (ii) incorporating bio-derived materials in devices to improve performance, and (iii) creating efficient interfaces between electronics and microbes to enable self-supported systems. These advances are expected to establish the foundation for future ultralow-power information processing, which is fundamentally related to the ultimate computing efficiency and storage capacity.

This SemiSynBio-II program (NSF 20-518) grant supports research on biological signal processing, such as sensory detection, neural computation, and memory consolidation with funding from the Division of Materials Research (DMR) of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate (MPS), the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) of the Biological Sciences Directorate (BIO),the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF) of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate (CISE), and the Division of Electrical,Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) of the Engineering Directorate (ENG).

"The functional molecules in cells are proteins - the expression, activity and interactions of particular proteins in any given cell define its structure and what it is capable of doing. The technologies used to study proteins on a large scale are collectively called proteomics. The main method used in proteomics is mass spectrometry (MS), which can calculate the molecular weight and abundance of molecules. The majority of proteomics workflows perform a step of protein digestion prior to MS. The result of digestion is that all the proteins become broken up into small chains, called peptides. This step has become common, because peptides are easier to analyse by MS, due to their lower mass, producing simpler data to interpret. One challenge in this digestion step is that some proteins break down quickly whereas for others digestion is incomplete, producing unreliable quantification data that are not fully understood or compensated for by current analysis software. To overcome this problem, the University of Texas Anderson Cancer Center will collaborate with the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom to develop an integrated suite of analysis techniques using a powerful statistical technique called Bayesian modelling. These advances will be incorporated into a freely available software suite.
  
Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) coupled to Liquid Chromatography (LC) is the primary technique used in proteomics. The most common approach is LC separation of tryptic fragments derived from a proteome digestion, followed by tandem MS of the peptides. This entire workflow is conceived as a series of discrete steps, some chemical, some instrumental, some informatics and some statistical. Existing software concentrates on subcomponents of the workflow, and comprise a series of deterministic, self-contained steps. This project will translate the whole protein quantification pipeline into a rigorous statistical framework underpinned by Bayesian methodology. The new framework will integrate evidence across all experimentally acquired datasets, and borrow strength from unused structure within a proteomics workflow, including digestion dynamics. The proposed pipeline consists of three synergistic developments (1) Utilization of all unidentified (peptide) features, as well as identified features, to infer the most likely mixture of proteins present in a sample; (2) Differential quantification of complex mixtures of known proteoforms; (3) Discovery of unknown proteoforms and all modifications (PTMs) carried by their quantification signatures. These advancements will elicit a step-change in quantification sensitivity and interpretation at the proteoform level for the first time. The end-to-end analysis solution will be made available within the user-centric standards compliant ProteoSuite package, and as a Galaxy workflow for high-throughput pipelines.",NSF,University of Pennsylvania,PA,98079,2016487,jeffrey.morris@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,Jeffrey,Morris,0,02/25/2020,09/01/2019,08/31/2020,Bilateral BBSRC-NSF/BIO: Bayesian Quantitative Proteomics,"['Wilson KI, Godara P, Jasien JV, Zohner YE, Morris JS Girkin CA, Samuels BC, Downs JC~Intra-Subject Variability and Diurnal Cycle of Ocular Perfusion Pressure as Characterized by Continuous Telemetry in Nonhuman Primates.~Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science~61~2020~1~~10.1167/iovs.61.6.7~0~ ~0~ ~18/10/2021 13:15:34.486000000', 'Zhang Y, Morris JS, Terry SN, Rao AUK, Baladandayuthapani V~Radio-iBAG: Radiomics-based Integrative Bayesian Analysis of Multiplatform Genomic Data~The Annals of Applied Statistics~13~2019~1957~~10.1214/19-aoas1238~0~ ~0~ ~18/10/2021 13:15:34.510000000', 'Turner DC, Miranda M, Morris JS, Girkin CA and Downs JC~Acute Stress Increases Intraocular Pressure in Nonhuman Primates~Ophthalmology Glaucoma~2~2019~210~~10.1016/j.ogla.2019.03.010~0~ ~0~ ~18/10/2021 13:15:34.476000000', 'Morris JS, Hassan MM, Amin HM and Kaseb AO~Rejoinder to Sun et al.~Hepatology~~2020~~~10.1002/hep.31619~0~ ~0~ ~18/10/2021 13:15:34.440000000', 'Liu Y, Li M and Morris JS~Function-on-scalar quantile regression with application to mass spectrometry proteomics data~The Annals of Applied Statistics~14~2019~521~~10.1214/19-AOAS1319~0~ ~0~ ~18/10/2021 13:15:34.416000000', 'Morris JS, Luthra R, Liu Y, Duose D, Lee W, Reddy N, Windham J, Chen H, Tong Z, Zhang B, Wei W, Manyam G, Broom B, Alvarez H, Katkhuda R, Morris V, Overman M, Mentor D, Davis JS, Kopetz S, and Maru D.~Gene Signature Classifier for Consensus Molecular Subtyping of Colorectal Carcinoma-Discovery and Validation in a CLIA-Certified Setting.~Clinical Cancer Research~~2020~~~10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-2403~0~ ~0~ ~18/10/2021 13:15:34.453000000', 'Morris JS, Hassan MM, Zohner EM, Wang Z, Xiao L, Rashid A, Abdel-Wahad R, Ballard K, Wolff RA, George B, Li L, Allen G, Li D, Wang W, Raghave K, Yao J, Amin HM, and Kaseb AO.~HepatoScore-14: Measures of biological heterogeneity significantly improve prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma risk~Hepatology~~2020~1~~10.1002/hep.31555~0~ ~0~ ~18/10/2021 13:15:34.443000000', 'Morris JS, Hassan MM, Amin HM and Kaseb AO~Rejoinder to Hou, Liu and Hsu.~Hepatology~~2020~~~10.1002/hep.31620~0~ ~0~ ~18/10/2021 13:15:34.430000000', 'Fazio MA, Girard MJA, Lee W, Morris JS, Borgoyne CF, Downs JC.~The Relationship Between Scleral Strain Change and Differential Cumulative Intraocular Pressure Exposure in the Nonhuman Primate Chronic Ocular Hypertension Model.~Investigative Opthalmology and Visual Science~60~2019~4141~~10.1167/iovs.19-27060.~0~ ~0~ ~18/10/2021 13:15:34.396000000', 'Yang H, Baladandayuthapani V, Rao AUK, and Morris JS~Quantile Function on Scalar Regression Analysis for Distributional Data~Journal of the American Statistical Association~115~2020~90~~10.1080/01621459.2019.1609969~0~ ~0~ ~18/10/2021 13:15:34.496000000', 'Turner DC, Edmiston AM, Zohner YE, Byrne K, Siegfried WP, Girkin CA, Morris JS, Downs JC~Transient Intraocular Pressure Fluctuations: Source, Magnitude, Frequency and Associated Mechanical Energy~Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science~60~2019~2572~~10.1167/iovs.19-26600~0~ ~0~ ~18/10/2021 13:15:34.456000000', 'Evrard YA, Srivastava A, Randjelovic J, Doroshow JH, Dean DA 2nd, Morris JS, Chuang JH; NCI PDXNet Consortium~Systematic Establishment of Robustness and Standards in Patient-Derived Xenograft Experiments and Analysis~Cancer Research~80~2019~2286~~10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-3101~0~ ~0~ ~18/10/2021 13:15:34.393000000', 'Jasien JV, Zohner YE, Asif SK, Rhodes LA, Samuels BC, Girkin CA, Morris JS, Downs JC.~Comparison of Extraocular and Intraocular Pressure Transducers for Measurement of Transient Intraocular Pressure Fluctuations Using Continuous Wireless Telemetry~Scientific Reports~10~2020~20893~~10.1038/s41598-020-77880-8~0~ ~0~ ~18/10/2021 13:15:34.410000000', 'Menter DG, Davis JS, Broom B, Overman MJ, Morris JS, and Kopetz S.~Back to the Colorectal Cancer Consensus Molecular Subtype Future~Current Gastroenterology Reports~21~2019~5~~10.1007/s11894-019-0674-9.~0~ ~0~ ~18/10/2021 13:15:34.426000000']","From this award, we have developed a set of statistical tools designed for extracting meaningful information about proteins expressed in a clinical sample that might have clinical or biological utility, and would be missed by simple, standard approaches.  We treat these data as ""complex functional data"", a type of data increasingly encountered in many areas of biological and medical research.  The develop,ent of general rigorous methods for these data that can model the entire data set without discarding information contained in the rich data, while accounting for their complex internal structure, promises to make a strong impact in many areas of biomedical research, withthe key being the ability to uncover insights contained in the data that would have been missed by simplistic current analytical approaches.  

While motivated by and applied to protein data applications in which the protein expressions in a clinical sample are used to infer information about the patient's clinical response or undelrying biological processes, the methods have broad application in many other data types including but not limited to genomic data, wearable devices, imaging data, and climate data.  In this grant period, we have developed a suite of models, methods, and software to fit them and freely shared these with the broad research community.  Besides developing these tools, we have also applied them to reveal important insights into various types of cancers as well as glaucoma.

"Biologists are deluged with sequence data yet have derived comparatively little biological information from it. The accurate annotation of protein function is key to understanding life, but experimentally determining what each protein does is costly and difficult, and cannot scale up to accommodate the vast amount of sequence data already available. Therefore discovering protein protein function by computational, rather than experimental means, is of primary importance. Genomic sequence data are available from thousands of species,  and those are coupled with massive high-throughput experimental data. Together, these data have created new opportunities as well as challenges for computational function prediction. As a result, many computational annotation methods have been developed by research groups worldwide, but their accuracy and applicability need to be improved upon. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG) is to bring together computational biologists, experimental biologists and biocurators who are dealing with the important problem of predicting protein function, to share ideas, and create collaborations. To improve computational function prediction methods, the Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation algorithms (CAFA) was established as an ongoing experiment. CAFA was designed to provide a large-scale assessment of computational methods dedicated to predicting protein function. By challenging dozens of research groups worldwide to develop and provide their best software for function prediction, the researchers involved in the AFP-SIG will improve the ability of biologists to understand life at the molecular level. The AFP-SIG researchers will also generate experimental data from fruit-flies, fungi and bacteria to be used as benchmarks to test the software participating in CAFA, and a deeper understanding of these model organisms. 

It is now possible to collect data that comprehensively profile many different states of complex biological systems. Using these data it should be possible to understand and explain the underlying systems, but significant challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is that, as researchers collect more data from many different organisms in many different systems, they discover more and different genes. Assigning functions to these newly discovered genes represents a key step towards interpretation of high-throughput data. This leads to a critical need to assess the quality of the function prediction methods that researchers have developed in recent years. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG), founded in 2005, is to bring together bioinformaticians and biologists who are addressing this key challenge of gene function prediction. In addition to sharing ideas and creating collaboration, AFP-SIG has created CAFA: the Critical Assessment of (protein) Function Annotation. CAFA is a community-driven challenge to assess the performance of protein function prediction software, and it has been carried out twice since 2010.  The investigators will provide the following outcomes: (1) robust open-source software to be used in function prediction and assessment of function prediction methods, incorporated into the high-profile annotation pipelines of UniProt-GOA; (2) expansion of the AFP community by engaging bioinformaticians, biocurators and experimentalists, thereby improving the quality and relevance of function prediction methods; (3) large-scale experimental screens in Drosophila, Candida and Pseudomonas for novel associations of targeted functional terms with genes; (4) an expanded CAFA event, incorporating both the curated annotations from the literature and our own experimental screens, in the last two years of the project.

In order to speed up discovery, however, it is necessary to combine experimental science and computation. Methodologies for protein function prediction are therefore an important component to the bigger questions as only a small fraction of these macromolecules can be studied in depth experimentally, where for the vast majority of them we might only be able to predict their biological roles. As there had been many methods for protein function prediction, we proposed to establish an independent and authoritative assessment of these techniques so that the scientific community and general public are aware of the state of the art in the field and also to stimulate further discovery in the field. We have done this successfully and fortunately we can report that in the past five years there has been an improvement in the overall accuracy of function prediction methods. Depending on their application, they can be used to understand general trends about functionalities of newly sequenced organisms or to prioritize biological experiments and optimize resource allocation. As part of the independent evaluation, we have performed our own experiments and have assigned functional terms to more than 1000 proteins from three species, thus demonstrating the synergy between experiment and computation. This project has also developed methodologies and approaches that extend to general science, mostly machine learning and through machine learning to many other fields. We have proposed new methods for dealing with data from so-called open world domains, where molecular data belongs, which will have applications in diverse fields. We have also established novel distance functions that unify some known distances across different types of data.  We have held four scientific meetings with more than 500 delegates in total, providing a forum for exchange of ideas and also networking opportunities. Finally, we have trained new generation of graduate students with the ability to think critically and work independently in this and related fields. We have also trained undergraduate researchers, two of whom have been from HBCU's. Both of these individuals have later proceeded to go to the graduate school. Overall, we believe this project has been highly successful.

"Non-technical abstract:
The goal of this project is to develop new ways of connecting electronics, biology, and information using living communities of bacteria. The majority of microbes on earth do not live as solitary cells. Instead, they form remarkably complex communities which are able to thrive in nearly every environment from the bottom of the ocean to the human gut. If we can integrate communities of bacteria with microelectronics, perhaps we could combine the impressive energy efficiency, environmental resilience, and multifunctional chemical sensing of bacterial biofilms, with the flexibility and programmability of modern semiconductors. The project engages the broader community by offering interdisciplinary courses on bioelectronics and computing, providing research opportunities for high school students and undergraduates, and organizing workshops that bring together researchers and industry representatives from different disciplines to investigate frontiers at the intersection of electronics, computing, and biology. These research goals and educational opportunities are relevant to many areas in the modern workforce, including computing, biotechnology, and synthetic biology.

Technical abstract:
This project explores hybrid information systems using bacterial biofilms integrated with semiconductor technology. Microbial biofilms are highly complex systems with emergent order, which can survive in widely varying environments. It was recently observed that Bacillus subtilis cells in biofilms can use ion channels to propagate electrical potential waves among populations of thousands of individual bacteria. Thanks to signal regeneration by downstream cells, these electrical signaling modes have the potential to travel farther than by diffusion alone, and they offer a unique opportunity for new modes of interfacing electronics and biology. The first goal of the project is to design a hardware platform which incorporates living biofilms on active custom semiconductor chips, which can both sense and actuate signaling within the biofilms. The second goal is to study the underlying mechanisms of electrical signaling and oscillations within single biofilms, as well as signaling between multiple nearby biofilms. The third goal is to utilize the electrical properties of the biofilm to encode abstract information written using addressable electrical stimulation, and to perform hybrid computations using programmable networks of coupled biofilm oscillators. These research activities are integrated with opportunities for cross-disciplinary educational programs involving both underserved Rhode Island students and the broader scientific community.

"This doctoral dissertation project will examine the energetic cost of brown adipose tissue (BAT), a heat-producing tissue known to be activated under cold conditions, in 100 adults from a lower-latitude population. Research on BAT in adults has been relatively understudied, and this project will expand the available data and geographic scope for investigating BAT’s role in human heat production, energy allocation, and cold adaptation. The project will advance fundamental knowledge in human biology, and may also inform public health research on obesity and diabetes. In addition to the direct transmission of some data to study participants, project outcomes will be shared with the greater public through platforms such as social media, public talks, and publications in open-access journals. Furthermore, this study will foster research collaborations with local research assistants, who will develop STEM research skills and facilitate the smooth and culturally appropriate implementation of the project. 

BAT has been extensively studied in hibernating mammals and in human infants, but fewer studies have focused on its functions in adults. Researchers have suggested that BAT may have played a role in human evolution as an adaptive defense mechanism against chronic cold and that it may also be useful in reducing risks of metabolic diseases given its physiological effects on metabolism. In this study, BAT function will be examined in a lower-latitude population showing an average body size and shape that is morphologically best adapted to retain heat despite living in a warm region. BAT will be inferred by comparing metabolic rates and heat dissipation in the chest and shoulder area (main BAT location in adults) at room temperature and at mild cold exposure. Simultaneously, fasting glucose levels as well as respiratory quotients (a ratio determining metabolic substrates consumed) will be measured before and after BAT activation to determine BAT’s use of glucose. By determining the metabolic and heat-producing capabilities of BAT in the study population, this research will parse out how BAT may be a physiological reflection of cold adapted morphology and by extension how BAT may have played a role in the successful dispersal of humans into different ecological settings independent of their morphology. A better understanding of the energy consumption and glucose disposal of BAT can provide insight into its potential utility in weight gain and diabetes prevention. These potential health benefits of BAT activation are especially important for regions burdened by high rates of obesity and diabetes.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Notre Dame,IN,26476,1945331,cocobock@nd.edu,Cara,Ocobock,1,03/17/2020,03/15/2020,02/28/2022,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Thermogenesis and energetic costs in humans,,"This project ""Thermogenesis and Energetic Costs in Humans"" investigated brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity and its associated metabolic health effects in Samoans. This work determined whether BAT, a heat-producing tissue was activated in a warm-climate population and how its associated effects on health may vary between Samoan adults. All data was collected in collaboration with and by the local non-profit Obesity, Lifestyle and Genetic Adaptations (OLaGA) study group in Apia, Samoa (n=100) between January and July 2021. The findings from this study provide some of the first evidence for the metabolic effects of BAT in a warm-climate population. Given the potential health benefits, such as reduced blood sugar levels and increases in the numbers of calories burned, associated with BAT, inferring BAT in a sample with obesity plays a critical role in our understanding of how BAT could benefit public health in Samoa and elsewhere. 

The study outcomes show that BAT activity can be inferred in humans independent of their climatic environment. The heat-producing capacities of BAT are activated at their highest rate when an individual experiences cold exposure, previously leading human biologists to believe that BAT is a cold-adapted trait found only in cold-adapted and cold-acclimatized populations. Our findings provide evidence that BAT is also found in adults with little to no daily cold exposure. Furthermore, this study provides additional evidence to a growing body of work showing that BAT is not only activated in adults with obesity but also contributes to greater rates of blood sugar use, ultimately reducing the risk of type II diabetes. These outcomes have several main takeaways contributing to future research questions and health interventions. 

First, evidence of BAT in Samoans suggests that BAT is a pan-human trait, found across all populations, independent of evolutionary history. While additional data is needed to compare the variation in the metabolic effects of BAT between populations and individuals, these results suggests that BAT is a common cold-adapted trait that likely played a role in the successful expansion of humans across various climates, providing additional protection from climatic fluctuations as groups migrated across the globe. Our results, thus, provide further evidence for the adaptability of humans and further informs us about the evolutionary history and success of humans in surviving and thriving in various environments. 

Second, this project is the accumulation of data showing how BAT activity is beneficial for metabolic health and may be used for obesity and type II diabetes prevention in the future. Blood glucose levels decreased significantly in Samoans with obesity and at high risk of type II diabetes suggesting that BAT is using blood sugar for heat production. This increased disposal of blood sugar decreases the risk of type II diabetes. Future work will further investigate the variation in the effects of BAT on metabolic health between populations and individuals, leading to evidence-based community-specific health interventions combating cardiovascular and metabolic disease. 

Third, this project directly contributed to participants’ understanding of their personal metabolic health as all participants left their testing appointment with a feedback sheet summarizing their personal metabolic and bio-health marker results complete with health and weight loss recommendations and tips. Together with the Samoan Ministry of Health a larger information campaign will result in the dissemination of the study results to the community and beyond, raising awareness about the benefits of BAT research and participating in research studies. 

Fourth, research assistants who participated in data collection were all trained by the co-PI Niclou and have gained new skills such as measuring skin heat dissipation and cooling protocols for inferring BAT. Using these skills, this local Samoan research team will be able to implement new research questions, study designs, and protocol developments in Samoa, contributing to the growing public health research efforts and interventions in their own country. 

Finally, this project also contributed to the scientific and educational training of a PhD student (Niclou). Niclou will continue working on BAT research, further delving into its evolutionary and health aspects. So far, this project has resulted in a completed and defended doctoral dissertation, multiple conference presentations (with two more to be presented later this year), and three papers that will be submitted for peer-review in academic publications in the near future. The project has also received attention outside of the field of anthropology and academia. Niclou was invited to talk about her research on podcasts and at workshops, helping spread the word about the need for greater research on BAT and its beneficial effects on health. We aim to continue sharing our findings in Samoa and in the US with fellow researchers and with the public.

"This doctoral research project examines how trauma experienced by women may be transmitted across generations, affecting their well-being and the well-being of their children. Working with populations who have endured high-stress environments, the investigators will conduct in-depth interviews with women when they are pregnant and subsequently measure markers of stress in those women and their infants, to understand how trauma affects women and children socially, emotionally, and biologically. Through these bio-ethnographic methods, the project will advance our understanding of epigenetic responses to the environment in humans. The project will also contribute to graduate training and mentoring and may inform public health research and behavioral health interventions. 

This project considers how biosocial inheritance, or the means by which social adversity or advantage is transmitted across generations, may play a role in intergenerational trauma. Specifically, this project considers (1) how women enduring adverse environments subjectively construct their traumatic experience; (2) whether maternal trauma may be ""molecularized"" at the level of the epigenome; (3) whether maternal traumatic experience is associated with neuroendocrine stress during pregnancy; and (4) whether maternal epigenetic or neuroendocrine signals correspond to those seen in offspring in early life. In this study of 112 mother-infant dyads, mothers' subjective appraisals of trauma will be elicited through semi-structured and life history interviews, which will be used to contextualize their responses to a survey of traumatic exposure and a trauma symptoms checklist. Their biological incorporation of trauma will be assessed with measures of DNA methylation and hair cortisol concentration. Methylation will be measured at five genes that are involved in the neuroendocrine stress response: NR3C1, FKBP5, BDNF, SLC6A4, and MAOA. To evaluate for broader patterns of epigenetic modification, epigenome-wide methylation analyses will also be conducted. To investigate the potential for intergenerational programming, this project will measure chronic cortisol secretion in mothers, cortisol reactivity following a modest stressor in infants at eight weeks of age, and DNA methylation at these five stress-related loci in both mothers and infants.

I asked: How do Latin American migrant women accommodate traumatic histories and motherhood amid the COVID-19 pandemic? My ethnography demonstrates the powerful ways women cope with histories of trauma and ongoing adversity. Using the metaphor of the monarch butterfly, I consider processes of migration from Latin America and adjustment to life in the U.S., motherhood including the sacrifices women make for the betterment of their children, and metamorphosis, or transformations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing structural vulnerability. Using person-centered ethnography, oral history, and archival data, I consider women's experiences within their political, social, historical, and cultural contexts.

First, I re-evaluate the demographic category of ""Latinx,"" consider patterns of migration from Latin America to New Haven, examine relationships between the Black and Latinx communities of New Haven, and trace movements of collective organizing for empowerment of the New Haven Latinx community. 

Second, I narrate the lives of migrant mothers, attending to their experiences of state failure in Latin America, ongoing structural violence in the U.S., and adaptation, focusing on the ways women orient themselves toward the futures of their children. I coin the terms ""strategic coupling"" to characterize the ways women engage in romantic and legal relationships with men to access social, political, and financial capital; ""imperative resilience"" to describe cognitive and social strategies of survival and resistance to oppressive regimes; and ""intergenerational fortitude"" to refer to the ways women harness the wisdom, experience, and values of their maternal forbearers to better support their children.

Finally, I discuss the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on migrant populations, expose the racism Latina mothers experience during pregnancy and birth and the ways they are excluded from services for which they are eligible when seeking healcare, and discuss policy solutions to mitigate the harms of structural vulnerability for Latin American migrant mothers.

Through this engaged and ethnographic work, I aim to promote structural competency for scholars and clinicians and advance health equity for migrant communities.

"To continue to remain competitive in the global economy, the U.S. must utilize its diverse talents to advance scientific knowledge and technological innovation. This project aims to increase the diversity of STEM researchers and professoriate. The American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) will continue the Lighting the Pathway (LTP) program, started in August 2014, to increase the representation of American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians in STEM faculty positions at colleges and universities across the country. The LTP program provides mentorship, professional development, community, and network-building opportunities year-round, both in-person and virtually, to facilitate LTP students successfully completing their degrees, advancing to the next academic stage, and persisting along the STEM academic career path. Planned activities will reinforce Native cultural identity, leverage existing resources, and create a network of Native STEM scholars and faculty. The LTP program helps scholars to overcome feelings of isolation both socially and culturally by connecting them with Native peers and mentors and with their broader STEM community. An evaluation component will be used to understand which critical elements of the LTP program are most effective in retaining students in STEM. The evaluation will assess the impact of the program on scholar persistence in STEM. Knowledge gained from this evaluation can inform the design of training programs for other underrepresented groups.

The project will recruit Native undergraduate, graduate and postdoc students whose major field of study is in the biosciences, engineering and/or geosciences. Over the course of 5 years, AISES will recruit a total of 72 students with interest in a career in academia. Each cohort group of 18 students will engage in the program for a period of two years, with possibility of staying in the program for continued mentoring and career guidance. Each LTP student will be matched with a senior faculty mentor, who will provide guidance in the student's academic endeavors and help in navigating the STEM career path. LTP participants will be encouraged to present their research work at a relevant scientific conference in their field of study. Students and mentors will also attend the AISES National Conference with a specific day dedicated to faculty career development. Additionally, the LTP students will receive professional development and coaching through webinars, assistance with applying for fellowship, and other activities relevant to success in a STEM career. The program will assist undergraduate participants in securing research experiences, provide training in leadership and other professional skills that will help them advance to the next academic level. These findings will serve as a guide for future, expanded-scale projects and will also inform application to other underrepresented groups.

This project is supported by the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO), Engineering (ENG) and Geosciences (GEO).

"This project intends to study the core enzymes that drive the production and breakdown of carbohydrates. These enzymes, called the carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes), are found in all living organisms and particularly in plants and plant-associated microbes. The complex carbohydrates found in plant cell walls are the most abundant, and renewable, organic material on Earth. If we had efficient systems to convert them to biomaterials and biofuels they would be attractive targets for bio-manufacturing projects. Important effects in the natural world are (i) the CAZymes produced by plant microbial pathogens cause plant cell wall breakdown leading to devastating crop loss ($5 billion in the United States and Canada each year) and (ii) bacteria in animal guts produce hundreds of CAZymes that digest the carbohydrates in the diet, some of which may have positive, and others toxic, consequences to the host. The research approach combines genomics and bioinformatics: the genome of a green algae will be sequenced and then bioinformatics tools will be used to carry out data analysis. This green algae is the common ancestor of all land plants, its genome compared to those of plants will show how evolution has modified core carbohydrate chemistry to meet changing environmental challenges. Bioengineering of these enzymes may well contribute to the development of a more sustainable and secure bioeconomy (e.g., bioenergy and agricultural industries) in the US, as part of the global Genomics market, whose value is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020. Students trained in the course of this project will be poised to become the next generation of scientists, able to exploit their understanding of comparative genome sequence analysis to create new understanding and novel applications. The educational and outreach objectives of this project are to engage students as active participants in the research activities, including data analysis, and to to train undergraduate students and K-12 Science teachers to understand the basics of genome sequencing and comparison methods, including hands-on skills. 


In the first Aim, new bioinformatics programs will be developed to allow in-depth CAZyme annotation with predicted biochemical activities. In the second Aim, the genomic context of CAZymes will be studied in microbial genomes and metagenomes of various ecological environments. Overall four computational tools will be developed, integrated, and delivered as a CAZyme bioinformatics web portal named dbCAN2. These free online tools will facilitate CAZyme research in various research fields such as genomics, carbohydrate, bioenergy, plant disease, food security, human gut microbiome, evolution and ecology. In the third Aim, this project will sequence and mine the genomes and transcriptomes of algae and early plants for CAZymes. This includes sequencing the genome and transcriptome of a green alga Zygnema circumcarinatum, the immediate ancestor of all land plants that is extremely critical for understanding the early evolution of carbohydrate-rich cell walls. The specific education activities include: (i) working with the Office of Student Engagement and Experiential Learning (OSEEL) of Northern Illinois University to bring undergraduate students, particularly under-represented minority students, into CAZyme bioinformatics research; (ii) collaborating with the Center for Secondary Science Teacher Education of NIU to integrate DNA sequencing and data analysis topics into the curriculum of the Teacher Licensure Program as well as the professional development programs for K-12 Science teachers; and (iii) incorporating Zygnema genome annotation as new lab components into BIOS308 (Genetics) and BIOS441 (Practical Bioinformatics).

"Human reproduction requires females to invest significant amounts of caloric energy into pregnancy, lactation, and childcare. It has been proposed that females have evolved ways to vary how much energy they spend on reproduction in response to energy availability, which has commonly been indexed by body fat. Excess body fat can adversely affect reproductive hormone pathways and disrupt menstrual cycles, and it is not clear whether this might in part be due to the influence of body fat levels on sensitivity to stress. This  research project examines female reproductive function among women in a population with comparatively high body fat levels who have been shown previously - in contrast to other populations - to experience relatively low rates of irregular menstrual cycles. In addition to contributing to a greater understanding of the diversity of body fat-reproductive function associations, this project supports scientific training for female graduate students and scientists in the research community, and helps strengthen scientific partnerships with local communities. 

Reproductive biologists have developed two scientific models to describe the relationship between ovarian function and caloric energy availability. The Lipostatic Model suggests that female reproductive function is closely associated with body fat levels, while the Metabolic Model suggests that female reproductive function is more strongly affected by caloric energy deficiencies. This project tests these models among females with high body fat levels by 1) examining the prevalence of menstrual irregularity and loss of ovulation among a study sample of approximately 150 females of mid-reproductive age, and 2) assessing reproductive hormone levels across the menstrual cycle in relation to body fat levels and physical activity. By using gold-standard dual x-ray absorptiometry to estimate subcutaneous fat together with wearable physical activity monitors to quantify daily physical activity, the project can address the question of whether high body fat levels protect female reproductive function from energetic stress caused by increased caloric demands.

"Bipedalism, or upright walking, is a defining characteristic of modern and ancestral humans. It was one of the earliest defining traits of the human lineage and played a significant role in shaping our behavior and anatomy. To better understand the evolution of bipedalism, many researchers have studied the pelvis, foot, and vertebral column, all of which play a part in bipedal movement; somewhat less attention has been paid to the knee joint despite its essential role during human bipedalism. This doctoral dissertation research project studies the movement and anatomy of the knee joint and the results of the research can be relevant both for understanding the origins and evolution of human upright walking, as well as functional anatomy of the knee joint. Given the high frequency of knee replacement in the U.S., this offers one key example of how evolutionary understandings can potentially inform medical perspectives, and approaches to injury prevention and intervention.

The goal of this research is to investigate the relationship between knee joint anatomy and locomotor function in modern primates to help understand the pattern of locomotor behavior in hominin and hominoid fossil records. This project is carried out in three complementary phases that combine modern primate kinematic data, modern primate skeletal data, and data collected from the distal femur, proximal tibia, and patella of fossil hominins and hominoids. These phases include collection of kinematic data on gait and degree of knee extension in living primates as they walk bipedally, skeletal sample measurements in individuals of the same species from museum collections, and application of results of the first two phases to interpret anatomy in the human and ape fossil record. Ultimately the results of this research can inform paleoanthropological perspectives regarding the body form from which modern human bipedalism evolved.

"Central to unraveling the origin of primates - the mammalian group to which humans belong - are the fossils of plesiadapiforms, extinct members of a group (Euarchonta) consisting of primates and closely related mammals. While some plesiadapiforms have long been suggested to share characteristics with some contemporary primates, additional analyses of the plesiadapiforms using newer, state-of-the-art methodologies can further advance our understanding of primate origins. This doctoral dissertation project uses methods such as high-resolution X-ray micro computed tomography (μCT) to analyze and compare the cranial anatomy of plesiadapiforms to that of extant primates and other placental mammals. Detailed cranial comparisons are generated that can add to the evaluation of evolutionary relationships among plesiadapiforms, extant primates, and other euarchontan mammals, in the context of a new evolutionary tree. This project also provides numerous opportunities for outreach through mentorship, public science engagement events, and data sharing. Insights from this project can be incorporated into programs that facilitate participation from groups underrepresented in STEM. The investigators also train undergraduate and master’s students in aspects of CT scan data processing, 3D printing, computer coding, and basic fossil preparation. The investigators plan to make all data generated from this project, such as CT scan data and data matrices, freely available on public online repositories to allow for repeatability and to enable future studies on primate evolution.

Plesiadapiform crania have traditionally played an important role in hypotheses about primate origins but remain poorly understood because they are unknown for a large majority of plesiadapiform species and because many of the known cranial specimens have not been analyzed using modern CT techniques. This study uses modern high-resolution CT technology to document new plesiadapiform cranial anatomy, reevaluate previously published cranial descriptions, and make thorough cranial comparisons among primates and other placental mammals. These data are incorporated into a new character-taxon matrix that is analyzed using both parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic methods to assess evolutionary relationships. Results from these analyses can allow investigators to assess (i) which, if any, cranial features are uniquely shared among plesiadapiforms and primates of modern aspect, (ii) interrelationships among plesiadapiform families, and (iii) hypotheses of plesiadapiform evolutionary relationships within Euarchonta. Ultimately, these new data can provide clarity on previously proposed shared cranial features among plesiadapiforms and primates of modern aspect and will promote a better understanding of the divergence of primates from other mammals and the first steps in primate evolutionary history.

Most project collaborators are scholars from groups historically underrepresented in STEM research. 

Nursing is commonly associated with extremely stressful conditions and poor cardiometabolic health outcomes, including coronary heart disease (CHD), metabolic disorders, obesity, and gastrointestinal complaints, especially in rotational/night shifts and in high stress hospital environments. This project compares biomarker and survey data from a cohort of nurses as they engage in differing types of shift work. Using a cross-sectional sample survey of nurses, the investigators measure both shift and non-shift nurses’ indicators of microbial diversity/composition, inflammation, intestinal permeability, and metabolism. Survey data are used to record diet, activity level, socioeconomic status, demographics, and shift-work conditions to assess how these factors may mediate metabolic and microbial outcomes. Biological samples and questionnaires are collected from a focused group who have not engaged in rotating shift work in over a year, starting in their first month of shiftwork, followed by monthly sampling for four months. It is predicted that gut microbiome composition among shift work and non-shift work nurses will differentiate as nurses begin shiftwork. Ultimately, the results of this project aim to illuminate one of the ways in which frontline shift labor may become embodied.

"Studies of conserved biological processes require model organisms that share attributes with humans. Most model organisms are easily grown in the laboratory and enable experimental manipulations. Over the last forty years, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has been instrumental in numerous fundamental advances in genetics, developmental biology, and neurobiology. However, all of these discoveries come from studies of a single genetic strain of the species. This limitation is similar to the argument that we can understand all of human biology by the study of a single person in our species. This project seeks to expand the C. elegans Natural Diversity Resource (CeNDR), which includes nearly 2,000 genetically distinct strains from across the world, and create the Caenorhabditis Natural Diversity Resource (CaeNDR), incorporating almost 2,000 C. briggsae and more than 700 C. tropicalis strains. This combined genetic diversity facilitates discoveries about the evolution of physiological and behavioral traits, including responses to chemical and biotic stresses. Because humans share many of the same genes and processes as this nematode species, studies using these organisms can teach us a great deal about how the human population varies and how evolution works.

CaeNDR has three major goals: (1) Collect, organize, and disseminate wild Caenorhabditis strains; (2) Organize and disseminate whole-genome sequence and variant data for wild strains; and (3) Provide a genetics portal to facilitate mappings and interpretations of results. The project will further increase the capacity of CaeNDR by expanding the set of strains and preparing them for easy dissemination to the community, adding new tools and extensibility to existing CaeNDR genomic resources, and releasing all of the data for the three Caenorhabditis species on an updated and redesigned website (CaeNDR.org) with critical improvements to security, infrastructure costs, and user interface and experience. The extensive CaeNDR user-base from C. elegans will be amplified by researchers using C. briggsae and C. tropicalis, allowing for novel comparative approaches across the Caenorhabditis genus. Most research groups do not have the combination of experimental, computational, and statistical training to easily perform studies of natural variation. This project will make these tools available and usable by a large number of research laboratories across diverse model organism communities.

"Life sciences have become a core part of public policy and scientific solutions to address problems affecting nearly all aspects of society, including climate change, defense, public health and medicine, clean energy and energy independence, industry (i.e., the bioeconomy), agriculture, and sustainable development. Convergence of the life sciences with other scientific disciplines is a core enabler of advances across these sectors.  In 2016, the National Science Foundation (NSF) established a program on Understanding the Rules of Life (URoL) to identify generalizable rules that govern biological systems at micro- and macro-scales.  With support from this award, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Board on Life Sciences (NASEM) will conduct a retrospective analysis of the URoL program. For this analysis, the NASEM will interact with URoL principal investigators individually and in group settings to understand the program’s: a) achievements; b) integration of multi-disciplinary, systems-level approaches; c) broader implications for studying highly-complex systems, future scientific questions, and future societal needs; and d) the production of generalizable rules that apply to different fields and scales. The outcomes from these discussions will be include a proceedings, which will be peer reviewed and published through the established NASEM processes.
 
The NSF URoL Big Idea challenged scientists across numerous disciplines to identify rules that govern how biological systems function at various scales and complexities, and determine which of those rules are generalizable across systems. The assessment and synthesis activities supported by this award are designed explicitly to: a) identify rules of life that apply within systems of similar scale and complexity; b) determine which of those rules also apply to systems of differing scales and complexity; and c) capture the contributions from the multidisciplinary teams in URoL-funded research towards providing insight into successful methods for collaborating across scientific disciplines. NASEM has published several reports describing convergence of the life sciences with other disciplines, which will inform discussions with URoL investigators and the project outcomes. Critical themes from unstructured and structured discussions will be captured to ensure that the outcomes of the assessment are informative to NSF and the broader scientific community.  Furthermore, the knowledge gained about effective multidisciplinary research environments will enable future scientists to establish and lead multidisciplinary teams toward addressing future societal and scientific problems.

"The Gulf of Mexico supports a wide array of habitats, from wetlands to reefs that maintain high levels of biodiversity, estimated at over 15,000 species; with up to 20% unknown to science.  The lack of biodiversity knowledge is significant in the context of this region with frequent hurricanes and human influences, like oil spills, that can impact and often interrupt valuable ecosystem services, including fisheries. Since its founding in 1980, Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) has built a marine biodiversity collection over well over 15,000 specimens representing over 500 species.  This valuable research and education resource is of value for assessing impacts to the Gulf of Mexico including coastal loss, hurricanes, and oil spills. It represents a substantial set of marine and coastal collections, especially for invertebrates, for the Louisiana coast. The Louisiana portion of the Gulf coast is unique.  It is affected by the Mississippi River outflow, extensive wetland systems, the Dead Zone, and human influences due to the higher concentrations of oil and gas refineries and wells. It is also a region affected by severe storms, including hurricanes.  And due to building damage during Hurricane Ida, the collections at LUMCON are at risk.
 
This proposal seeks to secure LUMCON’s natural history collections for future research and education. Specifically, the project will secure curatorial staff to aid in conservatory efforts, relocate and secure LUMCON’s natural history collections in a new location, and assess the condition of the current collection and develop and implement a cataloging system to facilitate and inform the strategy for growing the collection. In addition, the project will create a paid minority summer internship program based on collections research. The student will train on collections-based research and learn museum collections methods.

"Tulane University’s fish collection, named in honor of Royal D. Suttkus, who collected most of its specimens, is the largest research collection of post-larval (juvenile to adult-sized) fish specimens in the world, presently housing 7,407,714 specimens in 204,105 cataloged species lots.  The collection is unique among fish collections for having repetitive samples taken from the same sites over several decades and high numbers of lots with large numbers of specimens of common fish species.  Specimens from the Suttkus Fish Collection support a wide breadth of published research, from taxonomic descriptions to studies of anatomy, invasive species, community ecology, conservation, microplastics in the environment, archaeology, and machine-learning based species classification. The collection will continue to grow by 900,000 additional specimens in 64,000 lots following Tulane’s recent acquisition of most of the specimens in the University of Louisiana Monroe’s (ULM) Neil H. Douglas Fish Collection, which Tulane led an effort to rescue in 2017.  The proposed project will provide for curatorial and databasing needs of both the Suttkus and Douglas fish collections.  Students from New Orleans Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) will be recruited for internships that will involve them in the project and introduce them to careers in biodiversity research and collections care. 
 
This project will make significant improvements to the Suttkus Fish Collection, expanding the collection to a third building on Tulane’s Hebert Center campus, creating two large collection storage areas in Bunker A-2 and moving jar lots from the collection’s other two buildings to these new storage areas.  To further secure the resource, curatorial needs will be addressed for the jar lots as they are being handled and specimens and data from the Neil H. Douglas (ULM) fish collection will be integrated into the Suttkus Fish Collection.   A problem in the large-specimen facility (Bunker A-15) with alcohol evaporation due to the bins’ faulty lids will be addressed by replacing these with the 48 large new storage containers.  In addition, the Suttkus Fish Collection’s Database Management System will be updated to make it more flexible, open source and compatible with modern data access and sharing technology.  The results of the project will be disseminated to communities of interest through conference presentations, publications, and software releases. Design of the collection management system will be flexible so that it can be adopted by any biodiversity collections that want to use it.  All technology produced in the project (code, documentation and infrastructure details for the collection management system) will be shared openly with the biodiversity collections community, and specimen data will be shared with iDigBio (idigbio.org), increasing the accessibility of these data.

"Chemical bonds between phosphorus and oxygen are important in building DNA and RNA, and also in supplying modern cells with energy. It is not known, however, whether the first life forms had the same chemistry, and early life in particular may have run on sulfur instead of phosphorus. This project will work backwards from the traces of this sulfur-based chemistry in modern life to reconstruct the role of sulfur-oxygen bonds in early ecosystems. Predictions made from this approach will be compared to the carbon and sulfur isotope record in  >2.5 billion year old rocks. We will use the astrobiology social media platform (SAGANet) for the conversations with public about this project and other studies of evolution of life on Earth.  
 
Phosphate esters, such as nucleotide triphosphates, diphosphates, and pyrophosphate, are the central component of energy metabolism in all living cells. It is not known, however, whether they were of similar paramount importance at the origin of life or in the first cells, or whether another kind of chemistry was playing the same role there. Considerations from geochemistry, molecular evolution, and systems biology imply that thioesters - high-energy bonds based on sulfur instead of phosphorus - may have supplied energy in the first metabolisms on Earth. This project will develop a broad and detailed understanding of the natural history of thioester utilization, working backwards to reconstruct ancient biochemistry from contemporary metabolism, and simultaneously examining pre-biological chemistries that can couple thioester formation and degradation. These two lines of study will allow the research team to infer the carbon and sulfur isotopic signatures of important metabolic pathways in a putative early thiobiosphere, and test whether these signatures are preserved in the >2.5 billion year old geological record. The results of this project should be of broad interest, and the project will engage with the scientific community and the public through journal publications as well as an established astrobiology social media platform (SAGANet).

"The Oregon State Arthropod Collection (OSAC) at Oregon State University is the largest insect collection in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), and houses about three million specimens. These specimens serve as the basis for insect diversity research in the PNW and additionally provide valuable information and reference material for regional stakeholders in forestry, agriculture, and conservation. This project installs a compactor system and new cabinets for the OSAC, taking advantage of a full building remodel, and completing OSAC’s transition into a modern, secure repository that will enable fifty years of research, growth, and active engagement with diverse communities. This project will also rehouse and improve several portions of the collection, thereby removing substantial infrastructural constraints impeding curation and research. Students, including those in groups underrepresented in STEM, will participate in this reinvigoration of the OSAC through these curatorial projects and through assisting in the creation of public displays about the collection and its specimens.

The project will install nineteen movable carriages, allowing OSAC to be housed in our newly renovated repository room. Curatorial projects will focus on ground beetles, brush-footed butterflies, true bugs, and true flies, and will result in their being rehoused in new cabinets, drawers, and unit trays. The entire collection will be deep-frozen as part of the project, and a new specimen-handling workflow developed, eradicating pest challenges that have historically plagued the collection. A series of community museum events, student curatorial projects, and an undergraduate course, will engage students and the public with the collection in an innovative story-telling approach whereby participants are encouraged to explore and be inspired by the multifaceted information associated with museum specimens.

"Research on the evolution of human skin pigmentation includes the characterization of this characteristic's underlying genetic variation. Recent studies have shown that the number of genes associated with skin pigmentation differs across populations and that much of this genetic variation is still unidentified due to underrepresentation of some populations in human genetic research. This doctoral dissertation project lays the groundwork necessary to model human skin pigmentation evolution by characterizing and functionally validating the genetic architecture of skin pigmentation in a population that has been underrepresented in such research. Data generated from this project can inform several pigmentation research objectives, including understanding the role of natural selection in shaping this human trait. The project can also be used as a model for research on other complex genetic traits and may inform other fields including bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology. Additionally, this project contributes to the skill development of undergraduate and graduate students through wet lab, computational, and fieldwork training.

The research team conducts fieldwork to collect paired genetic and pigmentation data from individuals in a population with high levels of ancestral alleles and higher levels of genetic diversity than other extant human populations. The research presents an opportunity to research pigmentation variation that may have been present in ancestral human populations, and therefore potentially broadens our understanding of pigmentation genetics globally. Newly collected samples will be genotyped and then evaluated using a genome-wide association (GWA) approach. Data from four different descent populations will be meta-analyzed to increase power to detect low-effect size loci. Regions identified in the GWA study are not necessarily causal pigmentation loci, rendering functional validation necessary. Top candidate genes are therefore identified and functionally evaluated for causality with CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) gene editing in zebrafish, an effective model organism to study human skin pigmentation. Using a rapid automated phenotyping platform to image larvae, pigmentation is analyzed comparing CRISPR- mosaic “knockout” fish with “mock” injected sibling controls. This strategy can functionally verify whether novel associated genes from the GWAS are causal pigmentation genes.

"The gut microbiome – the term used to refer to the collective community of microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tract – is a key player in the creation and use of energy for the host. Studies show that disrupting the course of development of the gut microbiome with antibiotics can increase body fat and the linked risk of obesity and disease later in life. These effects can differ between females and males.  This doctoral dissertation research investigates how antibiotic use causes increased body fat, frames this effect in an evolutionary context, and examines why sex differences in this effect arise. Combining these areas of focus allows this investigation of cause-effect relationships important for understanding how factors experienced in early life impact health outcomes later in life, and in addition to the potential to inform public health research, the results speak to larger theoretical frameworks in biological anthropology.  This research provides intensive training for a female graduate student and opportunities for undergraduate students, particularly members of groups currently underrepresented in STEM fields to gain robust research experience. 

Environmental adversity during early life can cue developmental changes in young animals that promote metabolic diseases in adults such as obesity. The gut microbiome plays critical roles in the regulation of host energy balance, with disruption of the gut microbiome through antibiotic use causing short-term weight and fat loss. Notably, despite short-term energy losses, exposure to antibiotics in early life has been linked to obesity and overweight in adulthood in humans, mice, livestock, and other animals. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying these long-term obesogenic effects remain unclear. The investigators hypothesize that gut microbiota depletion during the critical period of early life constrains energy budgets, necessitating energy allocation tradeoffs that persist in adulthood at the cost of fitness. To test this hypothesis, the investigators profile the gut microbiome and host energy allocation over the course of development in a conventional mouse model of early-life antibiotic treatment, followed by direct evaluation of immune and reproductive fitness in adulthood. The proposed study provides novel evidence linking disciplines concerned with the developmental origins of health and disease to those concerned with the gut microbiota and host-microbial interactions. The results of this research contribute to theoretical discussions regarding trade-offs following early life influence and illuminates the factors contributing to rising rates of metabolic diseases across the globe.

"As humans age, the density of the mineral content of long bones declines, and bone geometry changes so that thickness of the bone wall decreases but overall diameter increases. It is expected that local mechanical loading from habitual activity will mediate both mineral loss and bone wall changes, which should be observable in comparisons of bone cross-sectional images between different bones. This doctoral dissertation project seeks to establish whether age-related changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone wall geometry co-occur locally within limb long bone cross-sections among living adults between 40-80 years of age. A localized relationship would suggest that geometric adaptation of bone to loading persists into advanced age despite overall loss of bone mass, which has implications for the interpretation of aging from archaeological contexts as well as for prevention of age-related fragility fractures. The project supports undergraduate and graduate training and research opportunities in STEM. In addition to scholarly dissemination of results in the form of conference presentations and journal publications, this research will be presented to project participants, as well as at public research forums, community centers, and other accessible settings. 

Age-related bone loss has been attributed to a host of interrelated systemic factors (e.g., hormone decline, loss of muscle strength) and is thereby treated as a global process throughout the body. With age, bone wall diameters expand and become thinner through the removal of bone from the internal surface and addition on the external surface. The resulting expansion of bone cross-sectional diameter bolsters resistance to bending under mechanical loads and, due to roughly concurrent timing with BMD decline, has been characterized as compensatory to bone loss. Earlier in life, bone wall geometry and microstructure adapt to mechanical loading. If this ability to adapt extends into late adulthood, it is possible that age-related wall expansion and BMD decline vary locally according to typical loading patterns within a bone cross-section, along the length of a bone, and between bone elements. If, in addition to local variation, results indicate that these processes exhibit local covariation, this research can provide further support to the compensatory relationship between the expansion of bone walls and BMD decline.

"When human groups first come into contact, diseases can be transmitted rapidly through previously unexposed populations. In the past, diseases during initial contact are believed to have led to mass mortality and likely influenced the outcome of colonization attempts. This doctoral dissertation project uses ancient DNA data to detect pathogens associated with conquest and colonization and determine how the pathogens evolved and why they were so deadly. The project outcomes can advance knowledge about the consequences of colonization as well as the evolution and ecology of diseases, many of which are still a struggle to treat and control today. The researchers emphasize substantive collaborations with descendant communities and community stakeholders. Local communities are actively involved in the project, and the research contributes to educational materials and museum exhibits in those regions. The project also fosters science communication and public outreach activities and provides laboratory training for undergraduates, including students from underrepresented groups in STEM.

This ancient pathogen genomics project aims to identify which specific pathogens were causing the widespread deaths of Indigenous people during European conquest, how these diseases evolved in a new environment, and how different environments and/or cultural practices may have led to differences in disease spread or mortality outcomes. The study examines data generated from approximately 200 individuals from four strategically selected early contact-era sites of differing ecological and cultural environments. The researchers use gold-standard ancient pathogen genomics methods to sequence the DNA of these pathogens, determine their evolutionary trees, confirm their European origin, discover how and when they may have evolved into modern-day strains, and detect hybridization or diversification events. Where there is enough data, the researchers also perform functional analyses to identify variants through specific defining markers such as any gene loss or gain important for virulence or pathogenicity. In addition to standard high-throughput genomics and bioinformatics methods, this study incorporates historical accounts, disease ecology, and archaeological contexts to uncover a more comprehensive perspective of key events in human history.

"Biological collections play an essential role in life science research. They support fundamental scientific studies at the molecular, cellular, organismal and community level, as well as applied research to improve health, food security, and energy production. The United States Culture Collection Network (USCCN) was established in 2012, engaging the culture collection community to facilitate the safe and responsible utilization of microbial resources through meetings and webinars, publications and position papers, and site visits to learn about collection practices. This award will establish the USCCN 2.0, a new Research Coordination Network (RCN) that will expand the scope and reach of the USCCN. The USCCN 2.0 will increase the reach of scientists across multiple disciplines to work toward addressing challenges and needs shared by all microbial collection managers and users. USCCN 2.0 will expand the network and identify additional collections through an online registry accessible by the broader scientific community. These data will increase the breadth and utility of living plant microbial collections for multi-disciplinary scientific projects. USCCN 2.0 will encourage participation of underrepresented communities and will promote a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce, increase partnerships between industry, academia, and other entities, and enhance infrastructure for research and education.

The specific aims of USCCN 2.0 are to increase participation in the network; enhance links with other collection registries and repositories; and to cultivate the long-term sustainability of participating collections and the USCCN.  The work on each of these aims will be underpinned by complementing and synergizing activities with other projects, networks, organizations, and societies globally. A top priority of the RCN is a collection registry to provide the necessary foundation to accomplish the network’s activities, and to ensure inclusivity of small research collections.  Through a professionally administered process, a more extensive and diverse community of U.S. collections will be identified and brought into the network.  Additional priorities include increasing participation and coordination among U.S. and international biological collections organizations; establishing linkages between current and future collection registries, repositories, and other forms of collected data; and building direct ties to stakeholders – those who develop or utilize microbes, microbial collections, and other microbial resources for research or industrial purposes – to build a network of networks.

"The Atlanta Botanical Garden (ABG) has served as a leader in plant science research, education, and conservation for more than four decades. These collections house 106,028 individual plants from 25,335 genetically unique accessions representing 12,096 taxa (species, subspecies, and varieties) from 276 plant families and over 1,800 genera. Most notably, ABG maintains the most diverse living collection of orchids in the United States with 2,328 taxa. Data related to these diverse plant collections are currently stored in an in-house database and are not accessible by the public or researchers. The focus of this project is to upgrade data storage to a modern commercial database with a public interface allowing visitors, researchers, conservationists, and educators to search ABG plant collections remotely or while at the Garden. This project will make plant collections at the Atlanta Botanical Garden publicly accessible for research, education, and conservation.

Botanic gardens play a critical role in basic plant research by providing freshly collected plant material to researchers from extensive living plant collections for very low cost. In addition, a highly skilled staff of horticulturists maintain and preserve collections full-time. The Plant Collections at the Atlanta Botanical Garden have been used in NSF funded projects and many other research projects, including graduate student research, and for conservation projects. To increase visibility and use of the collections for research, this project will migrate the existing Plant Records database to an updated platform which will be connected to external databases, making collection data publicly searchable. Priority plant collections will be digitized and permanently planted priority collections will be mapped. Research requests will be streamlined via creation of a Google Form. This will enable collection information to be shared with the greater research community via outreach to professional botanical societies and on the Garden’s social media pages. We expect utilization of the collection to significantly increase, allowing creative and impactful research to be undertaken with plants in the collections. During public events showcasing the collections the public database interface will be promoted to encourage visitors to explore collections digitally both before, during, and after their visit to the Garden. Finally, undergraduate and high school students will be integrated into the digitization project, learning plant morphology and GIS mapping, which are useful and transferable skills.

"Among the notable “shoulders of giants” on which present-day botanists stand are those of Dr. Sherwin Carlquist (1930–2021). Carlquist leaves behind a rich legacy and significant collections resulting from over 30 years of important botanical research. Over the course of his distinguished career, Carlquist published prolifically, with over 300 research papers covering such topics as plant anatomy and systematics, evolutionary and ecological theory, flower development, morphology, island biogeography, and taxonomy. As a researcher, Carlquist considered the biological elements within an environment as comprising a dynamic network. This network informed his method for collecting specimens and the rich array of materials and records he generated through that practice. The Carlquist Collection, housed at the California Botanic Garden Herbarium (RSA) and the Botanical Research Institute of Texas Library (BRIT), collectively contains 191,789 objects, including herbarium specimens, wood specimens, plant material preserved in spirits, wood anatomy microscope slides, field photograph transparency slides, black and white photographs, and field collection notebooks. A significant portion of the Carlquist Collection has never been curated or digitized, making much of the collection inaccessible. Further, some of the collection materials have faced varying degrees of deterioration owing to inadequate housing in non-archival materials. In a collaborative effort between RSA and BRIT, this project aims to curate and digitize these important collections and their associated data to provide long-term preservation and to create an Extended Specimen Network (ESN), wherein Carlquist’s specimens, field photographs, and collection notebooks will be linked to form an aggregated collection, thus creating limitless additional preparations and digital resources. The project will facilitate immediate application to a suite of research areas, including systematic, wood anatomy, ecology, biogeography, island biology, phenology, plant conservation, history of science, plant humanities, and archival theory and practices. The Carlquist Collection will be publicly available via online data portals.

Held at the Herbarium at California Botanic Garden (RSA) and the Library at the Botanical Research Institute of Texas (BRIT), the Sherwin Carlquist Collection encompasses more than 30 years of botanical field research comprising 30,770 biological collections and 161,019 archival objects. This project aims to (1) curate the Carlquist Collection for long-term preservation; (2) digitize and mobilize data for all collections materials held at both institutions; (3) link transcribed collection information, images, and metadata across all biological collections and archival objects; and (4) publish and make publicly available as an aggregated collection through online data portals, including iDigBio and GBIF. This project represents a unique collaborative and interdisciplinary opportunity between natural history collections and archives to create one of the first Extended Specimen Networks (ESN) for a renowned American botanist and serves more broadly to establish a new paradigm for how natural history collections and archives communities envision, implement, and utilize ESN’s within and among their collections. Integral to the project are the activities that involve participation from students at different levels in their academic career. The project will provide education, training, and capacity building for underserved youth and emerging professionals in a field that will greatly benefit from their participation.

"With support from both the Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Division of Materials Research, an award is made to the University of Delaware to design and develop plans for a national network of ultrahigh field (UHF) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer facilities. The overall goal of the project will be to create the most powerful NMR network in the world with comprehensive resources and expertise, spanning key areas of NSF interest, that will be accessible to the entire scientific community within the United States. Gains in sensitivity, resolution, and information content are highly nonlinear with magnetic field strength, and ultrahigh fields combined with state-of-the-art NMR probes and pulse sequences will enable fundamental investigations, with atomic resolution, of emergent phenomena not accessible with the current technologies.  State-of-the-art UHF NMR instruments will be sited at strategically located public institutions geographically distributed across the US. The NMR network will be made available to researchers across multiple disciplines for advancing the development and use of in vivo, in vitro, in situ, solution, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy to address diverse problems of high fundamental and technological importance. Instruments will be connected through a central cyberinfrastructure hub and integrated with other high-field and UHF NMR instrumentation.  The proposed nationwide UHF NMR network will enable experts and non-experts to access both UHF NMR instruments and a diversity of NMR expertise. The intellectual framework established through the proposed network will provide unique training for students in state- of-the-art NMR methods and applications. The outreach program encompassing training in NMR instrumentation and application of NMR methods will be invaluable for the development of the next generation of scientists.

Planning the UHF NMR network will set the stage to address the urgent nationwide need for ultrahigh field NMR infrastructure. The planning activities supported by this award will identify the primary scientific, technical and system performance requirements and associated designs and specifications for the UHF NMR network. Through these activities, the researchers will formulate a plan to execute and manage the UHF NMR network, including a project schedule with identified risks and plans to mitigate them, a governance plan and effective project management methods for tracking progress, costs and performance.  Outcomes from this effort will include sound baseline cost estimates for implementation and anticipated operations and maintenance costs. The researchers will also develop plans for effective student training and the involvement of a diverse workforce in instrumentation, facility development, and data analysis.

"Biological collections in the United States have amassed over 500 million specimens but only 14% of these have been digitized; thus we need to greatly expand existing tools and methods to efficiently digitize specimen data. This project addresses this need by transforming Symbiota, one of the most widely used software platforms for mobilizing specimens in US research collections. Symbiota is an online biodiversity data management software platform that integrates data and images from networks of data providers. It has helped mobilize over 37 million specimen records from 766 natural history collections and is one of the most successful platforms for creating large collaborative data communities for sharing and displaying biodiversity data. Symbiota is used by 74% of the projects funded by the NSF Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and is thus a key platform to help digitize the estimated 430 million specimens in US collections that have yet to be digitized. Symbiota's success is largely due to its low learning curve and powerful set of tools for documenting species occurrences and integrating them with images and detailed taxonomic descriptions. But its widespread use has yielded significant feedback on how it could be made more effective. To accomplish this and aid its future development, Symbiota needs a fundamental restructuring. This project will transform Symbiota into a new version, Symbiota2, to catalyze contributions, expand research use, enrich education-outreach activities, and increase sustainability. Symbiota2 will enhance our ability to address a broad spectrum of biodiversity-related research questions by facilitating data visualization, linking multiple data sources (e.g., publications), creating better tools for data quality assessment, and monitoring data usage.

The transformation of Symbiota into Symbiota2 will completely refactor its code structure to emphasize modularity and improve usability and accessibility. This transformation will achieve the following goals, derived through direct management of Symbiota data portals and concerted and dedicated interactions with the Symbiota user community: 1) Provide RESTful web services so that data can be easily incorporated into a scientific workflow, 2) Build a plugin architecture to ease the development of new features, 3) Create a database abstraction layer to include a wide variety of backend database management systems, 4) Increase data utility by supporting analytical and visualization tools, 5) Separate the Graphical User Interface (GUI) from other processing so that new GUIs can be used, and 6) Enhance the data collection by making it easier to add new kinds of data and work offline. With these goals met, Symbiota2 will be a powerful biodiversity data management system fulfilling the needs of developers, data providers, researchers, and education professionals, as well as being interoperable with other biodiversity initiatives.

"Estimating the age of individuals based on skeletal elements can inform our understanding of human biocultural experiences, identities, and population dynamics across the history of our species. Methods that use information about dental development are particularly useful for juvenile age estimation. This doctoral dissertation research project examines the developmental relationships between teeth and how these relationships affect error rates in juvenile dental age estimation. A better understanding of human variation in dental correlations can improve both methods of age estimation for bioarchaeological and forensic research as well as clinical understanding of human growth and development. The project supports graduate training in STEM, the development of open-source dental age estimation software, and online training workshops for researchers and practitioners.  

In order to simplify mathematical modeling, it is often assumed that dental developmental traits are independent from one another after accounting for the effect of chronological age. The problem with this conditional independence assumption is that if conditional independence is not biologically valid, resulting age estimates will be biased and have error rates that are larger than expected. This is a problem in both bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology because biased age estimates can compromise our understanding of past populations and unknown age interval error rates do not meet the Daubert standard for expert testimony. These issues are addressed through three specific aims: 1) characterize the extent of correlations between developing teeth, 2) characterize the degree of variability of correlations between developing teeth, and 3) develop, validate, and test an open-source developmental age estimation program that incorporates the correlations between teeth. These aims are approached using Bayesian statistical models and cluster analysis in R. Models are fit to dental development scores of living children and validated using dental development scores from existing decedent databases in order to develop the age estimation software.

"In social species, there is variation in the extent to which individuals within groups use the position or behaviors of those closest to them to inform their own behavior; this is called social responsiveness. While previous research has demonstrated that variation in social responsiveness among individuals in a group influences ways in which the whole group behaves, this research has been through work in laboratories or using computer simulations. In order to better understand this phenomenon and how it relates to the evolution of social behavior, this doctoral dissertation research project examines these relationships in natural settings. The investigators use new tracking technologies and advance the field of biological anthropology by introducing non-invasive, image-based techniques for tracking nonhuman primate movements and interactions in the wild. Through this project the investigators create opportunities for both masters’ and undergraduate thesis projects and develop new educational modules on collective animal behavior targeted toward middle-school students. 

Collective behavior researchers have proposed that socially responsive individuals follow cues given by neighbors to make inferences about environmental conditions and resource locations, while unresponsive individuals gather information privately through independent investigation of the environment. Theory predicts that the extent of within-group variation in social responsiveness produces group-level traits, such as cohesion and collective decision-making regimes, which in turn have consequences for individual fitness. This project has three specific objectives: (1) identify the contexts in which wild female savannah baboons are socially responsive; (2) examine if variation in social responsiveness affects collective behavior; and (3) test if group composition affects individual fitness according to its expected effects on collective movement. To achieve these objectives, novel data are collected in the field using 3D stereo videography and GPS-accelerometer collars. Long-term demographic and behavioral data collected over five decades of population monitoring are used to contextualize results.  Furthermore, by considering the simultaneous “bottom-up” effects of individual variation on collective behavior and the “top-down” effects of collective behavior on individual fitness in a highly social primate, this project offers novel insight into the adaptive value of social responsiveness and its role in patterning group-level phenomena.

"Bipedalism is the ability to habitually stand and walk upright on two legs and is one of the defining features of humans. Consequently, our understanding of human evolution depends on reconstructing how and why bipedalism evolved. This doctoral dissertation research project uses information about the “family tree” of extinct human species to reconstruct how, when, and why skeletal features that are critical for bipedalism evolved. This reconstruction allows the project investigators to test key hypotheses about human origins, including those concerning the role that environmental factors may have played in shaping our evolutionary history. This study investigates how ecological conditions have influenced human evolution, a line of inquiry that is particularly important in the context of global climate change. This project also supports the research of an early career female scientist from an historically underrepresented group in STEM and contributes to the diversity of scholarship in Biological Anthropology.

This research tests two hypotheses relating patterns of character evolution to the ecological, temporal, and geographical contexts in which skeletal traits related to hominin bipedalism evolved. The first hypothesis addresses the patterns and processes by which bipedalism originated and subsequently evolved, as well as the selective history that may have shaped its evolution. The second hypothesis concerns whether the evolution of derived locomotor traits is temporally correlated with paleoenvironmental change and whether incorporating available paleoenvironmental data improves evolutionary models. Patterns of character evolution are analyzed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. Random and non-random evolutionary models are tested to examine which model is the most appropriate for explaining the evolution of hominin locomotor anatomy. The project helps answer several fundamental questions in paleoanthropology: How does phylogeny inform our understanding of the evolution of postcranial traits that function mechanically during bipedalism? What does the pattern of evolution for these traits tell us about how, why, and when bipedalism evolved during human evolution? What are the evolutionary forces driving the evolution of these characters? What are the magnitude and direction of changes in morphological characters that enhance bipedalism? How might changes in bipedal features relate to changes in the environment? Answers to these questions substantially inform our understanding of the evolution of one of the first and most fundamental hominin adaptations.

"The human species has been shaped by many biological and cultural processes, including the infectious diseases we have experienced over the millennia and our responses to those events. Given the ongoing threat of emerging infectious disease, understanding the ways in which humans and pathogens impacted one another in the past can inform infectious disease research in the present. This doctoral dissertation project examines the origins and evolution of the disease pathogen responsible for the deadliest form of human malaria (P. falciparum). This pathogen is thought to have evolved through the transfer of a gorilla parasite to humans, but the timing and anthropological context for this event and malaria’s subsequent global spread remain poorly understood. The project traces malaria’s evolutionary history through analysis of both ancient P. falciparum genomes and related great ape parasites. The project also generates new methods and tools that can be applied in other genomic research projects, fosters student training and international research collaborations, and generates new resources for public science education and outreach. 

The project is part of an international collaborative effort of geneticists and primatologists to reconstruct genomes from ancient Plasmodium falciparum and related great ape parasites. Using genomic analyses to estimate when P. falciparum first emerged as a human parasite, the co-PI and colleagues explore whether specific ecological and/or cultural factors, particularly the adoption or diversification of agriculture, may have favored this zoonotic event. Comparing ancient and modern parasite genomes, the investigators explore the timing and route of malaria’s global dissemination to understand the impact of human mobility on pathogen dispersal in the past. This project is anticipated to generate valuable, concrete resources for the broader scientific community, including genome-wide data from ancient Plasmodium falciparum and wild-living gorilla Plasmodium parasites.

"Arsenic causes severe toxicological effects in humans, yet some human populations have evolved to tolerate this element. Today, people in some regions may carry protective mutations in a key enzyme that metabolizes arsenic in the liver. However, several aspects remain unclear about the evolutionary history and genetic basis of arsenic tolerance. This doctoral dissertation research project therefore examines the genetic history, modes of subsistence, and gene regulatory mechanisms in ancient and modern DNA samples from populations exposed to arsenic. The findings can expand our understanding of biocultural processes through which humans are able to adapt to their environment. The project also supports student mentorship and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, opportunities for international research collaborations, and science dissemination through conferences and social media.

This project is centered on the understanding of the cultural and biological diversity of ancient and modern populations living in an arsenic rich region. Specifically, three main questions are addressed: (1) what are the genetic history and relationships among ancient and modern populations? (2) how did the transition to agriculture impact diet and oral health? and (3) what role/function do the mutations associated with arsenic tolerance play in the expression of the AS3MT gene? The researcher reconstructs the genetic prehistory of the region using ancient DNA and modern genomic data. In addition, oral microbiome data from ancient dental calculus are used to characterize the prehistoric diet, oral health and environmental exposures among pre-agricultural and agricultural populations. Third, genetic sequences carrying protective mutations are used to assess experimentally whether they alter/regulate the expression of the AS3MT gene in vitro.

"This project will preserve and improve access to the Joseph F. Rock Herbarium at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa through digitization of its 55,000 specimens. Hawaiʻi has some of the greatest biodiversity in the United States, particularly when it comes to its native plants: 90% are found nowhere else in the world. A high proportion of these plants are listed as threatened or endangered, and many have gone extinct in the last century. Natural history collections serve as invaluable records of biodiversity and are important references for species that are threatened, endangered, or otherwise difficult to access. The Joseph F. Rock herbarium is one of the oldest herbaria in the Pacific and is home to rare and endemic species of the Hawaiian and Pacific islands. The newly digitized specimens will be available to researchers across the globe, greatly increasing the utility of the collection. Digitization will be conducted by undergraduates at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa to provide meaningful research experiences for students. The herbarium will host volunteer digitization events, increase collaboration with the campus arboretum, and engage with the public via events at a local botanical garden.

The rare and endemic Hawaiian and Pacific island plant specimens in the Rock herbarium will be preserved through overall modernization of the collection. Specifically, this project will digitize the 55,000 specimens in the collection, remove the backlog of specimens that need to be accessioned, and disseminate specimen data to a broader research community through a dedicated Consortium of Pacific Herbaria web portal and iDigBio.org. Modernization will also include expanded pest management and expanding the throughput of specimen digitization. The project additionally serves to maintain and strengthen collaborations across Pacific herbaria and promote digitization of other, smaller collections. The project will employ nine students each year, emphasizing the training and retention of students from historically excluded groups, including Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. Outreach efforts will focus on connecting preserved specimens to living collections on the University of Hawaiʻi Campus Arboretum and Lyon Arboretum and continuing efforts to connect the herbarium to Hawaiian culture and knowledge.

"Scientific specimens, collected over multiple centuries, and their associated data represent a body of research and knowledge about biodiversity.  However most of them are still not readily accessible or readily usable; thus, hampering efforts to address biodiversity questions. It is often the biodiversity data from regionally focused small institutions that are inaccessible, despite their importance. Such an institution is the Claude E. Phillips Herbarium in Delaware, which houses over 200,000 specimens from all major plant groups. These specimens were collected locally on the Delmarva Peninsula as well as nationally and globally over the last 200 years, and represent valuable resources for research and education. This project will digitize about 130,000 plant specimens to help fill gaps in herbarium specimen digitization. The mobilized data are particularly significant in their geographic, taxonomic, and temporal coverage and will provide baseline information to assess patterns and trends in biodiversity across space and time. At the same time, the project will also train the next generation of the herbarium workforce to help ensure that centuries of botanical legacy will be cared for and will continue to provide long-term benefits.

To increase accessibility of biodiversity data, the project will produce about 130,000 high resolution specimen images and a database of both transcribed specimen metadata and georeferenced localities, all of which will be released online for public access through iDigBio (idigbio.org) and the Consortium of Mid-Atlantic Herbaria's Symbiota portal (midatlanticherbaria.org). In parallel with, and aided by, the digitization process, a curatorial upgrade will be undertaken to modernize collections care and management at the Claude E. Phillips Herbarium, with the ultimate goals of improving curation and customer service as well as promoting usage and sustainability of the collections. Training of undergraduate students at Delaware State University is an integral part of the project and will expand participation of groups still underrepresented in STEM, particularly natural history. Project personnel will be involved in all aspects of digitization and curation. Meanwhile, access to the mobilized data will enable further educational and research opportunities both within and outside the institution. The project will also contribute to regional capacity building by engaging the public through workshops, tours, crowdsourcing, and other outreach events.

"Several human populations, each with distinct histories, have adapted to harsh high-altitude environments over the course of thousands of years. This doctoral dissertation research project compares the physiologies of two high-altitude populations and assesses the extent to which they have adapted similarly or differently to the same environmental stressor – low oxygen. Using the same methods, measured in populations thousands of miles apart at the same elevation thousands of feet above sea level, the project takes a new approach by measuring how high-altitude adaptations work in people during physical activity. The results of the research build on a large body of previous research on this topic and provide important information about how the high-altitude adaptations in both populations have contributed to their survival over time in low-oxygen environments. The project investigators provide scientific outreach among a local community and incorporate feedback and ideas from study participants into the project. This project also provides training for undergraduate and graduate students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines.

Some highland populations have resided in hypoxic environments for thousands of years, promoting stable evolutionary changes in aspects of their biology related to oxygen transport and delivery. Though exposed to the same selective pressure, these populations exhibit some distinct physiological adaptations, suggesting that certain historical contingencies have shaped different trajectories of trait evolution across geographic space and time. The overall objective of this project is to compare the mechanisms of improved oxygen delivery at high altitude. The central hypothesis that this study tests is that one population improves oxygen delivery primarily through increased blood oxygen content, while the other improves oxygen delivery primarily through increased blood flow. Using refined and carefully matched protocols, this project employs exercise testing, respiratory gas analysis, and hematological measurements in 70 individuals from each population to test this hypothesis. The results of this research contribute to a large body of research on human biological variation in relationship to environmental stressors, importantly through the added perspective of oxygen delivery during the stress of physical activity at high-altitude.

"This doctoral dissertation project examines the early diversification of apes within the broader context of mammalian community evolution. Leveraging rich fossil collections, the investigators characterize mammal assemblages from multiple, well-studied localities to examine how time, space and environmental factors impacted mammalian community structure. The scientific importance of this project lies in providing a comparative backdrop of mammalian evolution to better understand the ecological setting for major adaptations in the ape and human lineage. More broadly, this project can have significant impacts for science and society by expanding participation in science through graduate training and research opportunities for undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM research. A relational database of paleontological data assembled through this project is planned for public distribution to scientists and educators via the Data Repository at the University of Minnesota (DRUM). Other results will be made available through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and public outreach opportunities aimed at providing scientific engagement at public schools and museums. 

The early divergence of ape lineages, during which several major adaptive characteristics of the ape-human clade were established, is primarily recorded in the early Miocene (ca. 23-16 Ma). Although fossil apes from this time have been the subject of intense study, little work has been done to properly situate the diversity of these species within the broader context of mammalian community evolution. This project asks the central question: how did environment, time, and geographic distance influence the structure of early Miocene mammalian communities? Using large fossil assemblages, this project pursues four specific questions: 1) do fossil assemblages from major collecting areas represent differences in mammalian community structure? 2) do changes in mammalian community structure track environmental differences inferred from associated paleoecological proxies? 3) are mammalian community structures most similar among assemblages that are closest in age? and 4) does similarity in mammalian community structure decrease with increasing geographic distance between assemblages? These questions are addressed by analyzing the mammalian community structure across 13 fossil localities that are already well-characterized in terms of age and paleoenvironment. By situating mammalian community succession within temporal, geographic, and environmental contexts, this project can inform our understanding of how these factors influenced changes among mammal species, thereby clarifying the ecological parameters within which major adaptations in the ape and human lineage arose.

"Early social adversity can shape an individual’s brain and behavior across the lifespan, but how these negative experiences exert their influence remains poorly understood. This doctoral dissertation project investigates the relationship between early life environment and aspects of microscopic brain anatomy in two nonhuman primate species. The research leverages existing primate brain collections to advance knowledge about early life stressors, brain, and behavior, and provides broader comparative context for research on similar processes in humans. The project supports graduate research and training in STEM and provides laboratory training and mentoring opportunities to undergraduate students who will have an active role in the research. The investigators plan to share these results with broad audiences via publications, conference talks, and science engagement activities with the public.

In early life, young individuals of many species rely on their mothers or caregivers to provide emotional support and to teach them the skills needed to thrive. Past research has indicated that adult animals who experienced separation from their mothers or caregivers at a young age exhibit anatomical differences in their brains such as significant increases in the size of some brain areas and tracts that connect these structures. Notably, the parts of the brain that are most affected make up the reward circuit, which functions to promote learning and motivate behaviors. Consequently, these anatomical differences in the brain could contribute to the development of social and cognitive deficits associated with early social adversity. The main objective of this project is to investigate at the microscopic level how rearing environment in early life can result in long-term structural changes of the reward circuit. The investigators use existing primate brain collections to compare individuals with different rearing histories across two species that are thought to vary in terms of neural plasticity. In each of these brains, the investigators perform analyses to visualize and quantify 1. connections made between neurons, 2. morphology of neurons, and 3. receptor expression of neurons. With these data, the investigators can begin to describe the mechanisms behind changes in brain structure as a result of early social adversity.

"Human leadership is thought to be unique compared to other animals in that it is often rooted in prestige rather than dominance. That is, instead of coercing others using physical intimidation, prestigious human leaders attract followers through admiration. Our closest living relatives provide crucial comparisons for understanding how the transition to prestige-based leadership happened in human evolutionary history. In some species, individuals maintain hierarchies that are defined by aggression but also show relatively extensive cooperation, which has been proposed to underlie human prestige. This doctoral dissertation research project investigates whether wild nonhuman primates exhibit some features of prestige-based leadership while at the same time keeping the dominance-based leadership seen in other animals. As part of this project, the investigators offer a leadership workshop for primary schools that emphasizes the value of cooperative leadership and opportunities for girls’ leadership while supporting scientific engagement and student-centered STEM learning.

The investigators integrate an intensive field study with long-term hormonal and behavioral data from the community of wild nonhuman primates to be studied to conduct a comprehensive non-invasive exploration of leadership in these primates. To do so, they develop a novel statistical method to assess whether longitudinal stability of stress physiology is indicative of individual variation in temperament. Next, they examine whether consistently moderate stress responses and non-reactive temperaments that distinguish prestigious human leaders also predict tolerant, prosocial behavioral strategies in nonhuman primates. Finally, they probe how behavioral strategies contribute to leadership pathways rooted in dominance versus prestige, specifically asking whether prosociality incurs benefits via social attractiveness independently of conventional dominance rank.

"Water requirements shape the behaviors and ways in which all animals interact with their environment. Access to sufficient clean water is especially important for maintaining hydration in lactating mammalian mothers. Many primate mothers produce a dilute milk over an extended period, which may present challenges to maintaining water balance in lactating females. This doctoral dissertation research project explores hydration status and water consumption behaviors in wild female primates and provides a comprehensive look at the multiple variables that can influence their water balance. This study also documents water quality, availability, and location in the context of frequent human-animal interactions and therefore has important implications for public health. Understanding hydration, how it varies based on ecological contexts, as well as how primates meet their water requirements has implications for the conservation of endangered populations that face changing environments. This project provides numerous training opportunities and supports capacity building. Results are shared through scientific journals, social media, and educational efforts in multiple settings.

This project tests the hypothesis that lactating female primates are more water stressed than other individuals in their group and alter their behavior to increase their water intake. It also tests the hypothesis that high-ranking females are buffered from lactation-related water stress due to their increased access to better quality food and water compared to low-ranking females. This project maps spatiotemporal variation in water availability and quality, both in food and free-standing water, across the primates’ habitat. Using behavioral observations and nutritional data, the researchers estimate water intake by lactating females. Using the collected physiological and behavioral data, the results clarify how water balance varies in females based on their reproductive state, dominance rank, and the water quality and availability in their home range. This project integrates new behavioral, physiological, ecological, spatiotemporal, and nutritional data to explore water balance and behavioral adaptations to hydration stress in an endangered primate species.

"The behavior, health, and digestive physiology of humans and non-human primates have evolved to meet the demands of acquiring adequate nutrition. Primarily plant-eating primates must reach nutritional requirements while coping with noxious plant compounds (plant secondary metabolites: PSMs) that are often produced in plants. Although these compounds are thought to be a strong selective force on primates, and even responsible for technological innovations in food processing and domestication in humans, we lack a clear idea of how these compounds influence the foraging, health, and digestive adaptations of wild primates. This doctoral dissertation research project examines the behavioral and physiological strategies that a wild primate species uses to cope with PSMs while reaching nutritional goals. This research will promote the conservation of a critically endangered species by maintaining a research presence on productive conservation land and providing local field assistants with alternative livelihoods to logging. The investigators will also provide training in laboratory and field methods to underrepresented students in STEM.

While it has become clear that the foraging behavior and health status of wild primates is linked to the nutrient composition of their foods, PSMs should also be a primary determinant of primate diets and health because of the negative effects that they can have, including reduced nutrient intake, toxicity, or even reduced reproductive success. This study uses a model system to explore how both nutrients and tannins, a common class of PSM, guide food selection through variable periods of preferred food availability and nutritional status, and throughout the course of development. Tannins are thought to be detrimental to consumers because they bind and reduce dietary protein, and the primates studied in this project depend on protein-derived energy to meet energetic demands during periods of preferred food scarcity. Tannins may thus be particularly detrimental to their health, and they may therefore have behavioral or physiological strategies to deal with them. The investigators use data on food availability, feeding behavior, nutrient composition of plant foods, and results from a qualitative assay of the effectiveness of tannins in food, to test how tannins and nutrients affect food selection and preference. The investigators also measure biomarkers of health in urine samples, including C-peptide of insulin and creatinine, to see if health status is related to intake of tannin-rich foods. Finally, they quantify tannin-binding proteins in saliva, which are thought to be produced as an adaptation to cope with dietary tannins. Overall, the results of this project provide important knowledge regarding food availability, preferences and nutritional and health related consequences in primates.

"Human populations have migrated to nearly every environment in the world, and as part of this process have modified and integrated with local ecologies. Human alterations to the environment, such as deforestation, contribute significantly to zoonotic disease transmission, including transmission of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms) from animals to humans, and from humans to animals. Less well studied are the impacts of the human-altered environment on marine mammal populations. This doctoral dissertation research project investigates the transmission of a human pathogen into marine mammal populations, uses preserved microorganisms on historical marine mammal remains as a unique resource to measure human-animal pathogen transmission, and explores the impact of human alterations on the marine environment. This project and the dissemination of its results serve to build collaborative research among anthropologists, conservation biologists and environmental ecologists through publication and through outreach with the National Parks Service, Skype a Scientist, and STEM mentorship for the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. 

Coastal runoff increases the introduction of human pathogens and antibiotics into the environment. This can lead to the spread of zoonotic disease in wildlife and the environmental selection for antibiotic resistance. Of importance, Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common hospital acquired infection of humans, has become endemic among California sea lions along the California Channel Islands. In addition, a hypervirulent strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp), has been documented along the Pacific Rim. However, the origin of this transmission event is unknown. This project studies the introduction of Klebsiella pneumoniae into the California sea lion population using museum collections. Museum collections can provide a timeline for studying environmental alterations as well as pathogen emergence. The investigators use metagenomic sequencing on California sea lion dental calculus to reconstruct the microbial community and link changes in microbial diversity to human activity. The investigators also perform in-solution DNA capture on specimens with Klebsiella pneumoniae to determine which strains are present. By investigating the oral microbiomes of California sea lions across time, the investigators assess whether any human-mediated alteration to the microbiome allowed for easier transmission of Klebsiella pneumoniae into the sea lion population.

"Biological collections are a primary source of information to understand Earth’s biodiversity. They not only document existing diversity, but also provide the baseline to track changes across time and geography, as well as extinctions at local and global scales. This project aims to rescue the orphaned Fish Collection of the Department of Marine Sciences at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez (UPR-M), improve access to specimens and associated information, and expand the shelving capacity of the Ichthyology Collection at the Sam Noble Museum (SNOMNH). Integration and accessibility of the two fish collections have the potential to be used across multiple scientific disciplines, including ecology, conservation biology, taxonomy, phylogenetics, fisheries management, anatomy, and physiology. The proposed activities for this proposal are organized around three primary goals—rescue, integration, and long-term preservation—each associated with specific timelines to achieve the overarching proposal goals. The team combines expertise of graduate and undergraduate students, and volunteers with museum experience at different levels in Oklahoma and Puerto Rico to provide a rich context for workshops, and for the development of an integrative training program for the next generation of scientists.
	Natural history collections play a fundamental role as repositories of biodiversity and provide verifiable and permanent records of wildlife and past environmental conditions. This project will rescue and safeguard the UPR-M Ichthyology Collection, one the largest biorepositories of marine fish biodiversity in the Caribbean, encompassing historical data from 13,000 specimens, comprising 805 species, 392 genera, and 123 families in imminent danger to become lost. Integration of the UPR-M Ichthyology collection into the SNOMNH will greatly increase its accessibility to scientists and other users through improved physical access, specimen loans, digitization of the collection, and sharing of data via the museum website, and other network portals. This project will enhance the infrastructure of the SNOMNH Ichthyology Collection and increase its scientific value and accessibility for scientists, educators, and the general public. The SNOMNH Ichthyology Collection is an important scientific resource and biological legacy for the lower Great Plains representing about 20% of the total fish diversity of the United States. It hosts diverse assemblages of mostly freshwater fishes (although its scope has recently expanded to include marine fish species as well), and endemic regional fish fauna from streams and reservoirs in Oklahoma. This project will provide multiple opportunities for integrating research into learning and education activities. Students at UPR-M and OU will participate in the collections-based activities as part of their academic and practical experiences and summer workshops at Puerto Rico.

"The goal of this project is to develop computer software that allows scientists to compare the genomes of natural populations of organisms. Population genomics (the study of diversity in the genomic DNA of populations instead of individuals) has important applications in agriculture, anthropology, conservation, medicine, and several other fields of biology. Recent technology advances have greatly lowered the cost of DNA sequencing so large amounts of data are available. At the same time statisticians have developed new methods for analyzing large collections of genome-sized data. Combining the data with the new analysis approaches can let scientists answer fundamental questions about the biology of species that have never before been accessible. However, most population genomics studies fail to take advantage of the latest population genomics statistical methods. This is because the genomic data requires a lot of processing to prepare it for the analysis steps, and these operations are not easy to learn. Lack of bioinformatics knowledge has led to erroneous conclusions, irreproducible results, incomplete analyses, and slow turnaround time of population genomics projects. This project aims to provide software that can handle those tasks in a consistent and correct way and allow direct access to the statistical tools, to bring about new insights in population biology. 

This project will address the largest impediments to model-based population genomics by building a user-friendly and intuitive pipeline platform, the ""Pop-gen Pipeline Platform"" (PPP). This platform will help researchers avoid the problems inherent in re-inventing data processing scripts to feed data into their population genomics analyses, and considerably reduce time and effort. PPP will include tested scripts and pipelines for data preparation, and in addition the tools needed to build evolutionary models, carry out analyses of data, and create visualization of results via the Ruffus Computation Pipeline Library in Python. PPP will also be developed as a stand-alone application with a graphical user interface (GUI) under the popular and robust Galaxy Project (www.galaxyproject.org) for bioinformatics analyses.

Online forums will be established for support, and to collect suggestions regarding what is desired for further development under PPP. Tutorials and videos about example applications of the PPP will be added to the Galaxy Project Wikipedia training channels.

"Physical characteristics of animals can help determine which ones survive and flourish, especially in a changing environment. These characteristics, also known as functional traits, include features such as length, height, shape, weight, growth rate, sex, and reproductive state. Studying these traits provides insights into how communities of different types of animals come together and how species and communities respond to changes in their environment over time, which is critical for conservation efforts. However, very little information about functional traits is available, and what is available is difficult to combine with other data. How these traits are influenced by environmental changes - such as climate change, pollution, urbanization and human predation - and how they shift over longer timescales are poorly understood, and the need for this information is outstripping the speed with which scientists can collect these data. Digitized collections of animals representing life from the past two million years contain a treasure trove of information about these individuals' functional traits, but these data are stored in multiple places and in different formats. Researchers may have recorded dates differently, for example, or used a variety of terms to describe a single physical feature. Making these data widely available in standardized formats could help scientists study changes in functional traits through time, linking their observations of traits of modern animals to those from fossil and archaeological records. The Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies (FuTRES) project will gather trait data from digitized records; to engage communities of researchers to make these data available, standardized, and useable; and to develop a more complete workflow for using these data in research. 

Functional trait data have revolutionized ecology and are transforming paleontology, but acquiring them requires extensive labor, not only in measuring traits but in managing and communicating the resulting data. When trait data are lacking, researchers substitute average values, or other characteristics like behavioral or dietary categories. These substitutes - assigned at the species level - obscure intraspecific changes in traits. FuTRES fills the clear need for informatics tools that give researchers access to existing trait data and a place to store new data as they are generated. FuTRES is assembling a varied collection of existing trait data, building a pipeline that converts data to an integrated, semantically enriched form, and developing an Application Programming Interface (API) and web platform to serve the data. One of the key innovations of FuTRES is the use of ontologies, an information science approach that creates computer-readable definitions of traits and describes the interrelationships of traits, organisms, collecting events, and other entities. In this way, FuTRES will make functional trait data searchable through reference to time, space, and vertebrate anatomy.  FuTRES will also provide access to trait data via popular data portals (e.g., VertNet) and software such as R, opening the data to scientists in biodiversity and other domains. The toolkit will be tested with mammalian use cases that leverage the massive scale of the unlocked data.  In sum, newly created access mechanisms and tools will provide novel approaches for analyses of trait variation across space and time, providing researchers in disparate fields discovery capabilities for relevant data that would otherwise have been invisible to them.

Adversity in early life has wide-ranging effects on individual growth and development. Research has documented important deficits in growth, especially in the limbs. Yet, changes induced by early life adversity are almost certainly expressed in other aspects of skeletal morphology. This doctoral dissertation research project uses life history theory to investigate how energetic trade-offs impact bone growth as well as bone structure and dynamic remodeling to develop a more complete understanding of the effects of early life condition on growth and development outcomes. These insights also shed light on more general drivers of individual variation and the evolutionary and biological mechanisms that enable such variation. The project supports the training and mentorship of diverse undergraduate and graduate students. Results will be shared via publications, outreach, and educational efforts to ensure broad dissemination. 

The research project investigates these issues in primates with well documented variation in growth and development outcomes and in socio-ecological environments during development. The investigators test the hypothesis that individuals born into high quality early life conditions (moderate rainfall, mothers of high dominance rank) will have improved markers of growth and structural and material properties of bone. The investigators test the additional hypothesis that the magnitude of impacts will be stronger in comparison to individuals with multiple sources of early life adversity. The investigators test the hypotheses via analysis of long bone lengths, cross-sectional geometric properties of bone, bone porosity, and parameters of bone remodeling. The study is novel in its integration of standard whole bone measurements with investigations of bone’s internal microscopic structural properties. Findings leverage bone’s ability to act as a window into an individual’s developmental past, providing insight into how the skeleton responds to environments throughout life and more general insights into the primate evolutionary biology.

Learning what to eat, how, and where to find food are significant challenges that arise over the course of development. Such challenges can also be social, when individuals have to compete with others for access to food. Yet how feeding competition affects food choice and developmental outcomes is poorly understood, particularly in scenarios where food is abundant and distributed evenly across an environment. This doctoral dissertation research tests how variation in feeding ecologies, including food competition, affects food choice and developmental outcomes among wild juvenile non-human primates inhabiting changing ecological and demographic environments. Results contribute to existing conservation management plans and provide concrete training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students. Results will be disseminated widely to academic and non-academic audiences.

The proposal merges theory from nutritional ecology and life history to investigate the significance of feeding competition among developing non-human primates, who lack the foraging competence of adults. Major objectives include investigating: 1) variation in food nutritional properties along ecological gradients; 2) development of adult-like foraging competence; and 3) impacts of feeding competition on dietary development of infant and juvenile individuals. The researchers integrate novel and long-term data on food nutritional properties and feeding behavior sampled across a diversity of habitat types. They collect novel nutritional data from plant food samples as well as feeding data generated through long-term monitoring and new behavioral observations. Results inform understanding of the evolution of primate juvenile periods, by improving our understanding of how immatures are impacted by feeding competition, even in contexts where food is apparently abundant. Further, this research generates insights regarding developmental responses to changes in ecology, which are important for predicting population dynamics and associated implications for conservation efforts.

"Access to clean water is a fundamental requirement for a healthy society. Numerous water safety crises in the past decade have shown that access to safe drinking water is not a guarantee, however. Moreover, there is community- and individual-level heterogeneity in relative vulnerability to water problems. Individual characteristics are likely to affect perceptions of water, in turn affecting decisions surrounding water use and associated health outcomes. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of scientists to examine social, behavioral, health, and climatic issues related to water resources. In addition to developing capacity at a minority-serving institution, the project  advances undergraduate teaching and training through curricular development and hands-on research opportunities. 

The project tests social science theories positing that ecological and social factors work together to affect water and climate vulnerability. Research objectives include examining the influence of social, economic, and political factors in water quality remediation efforts in a context with contemporary and historical variation in deployment of such efforts; and providing an analytical framework transferable to other environmental remediation projects. To do so, this project documents perceptions of water among diverse stakeholders, and how these perceptions interact with individual and community characteristics. The project also analyzes and provides data to document the full range of climate variability to layer results within broader historical climatic fluctuations. Importantly, this climate history will provide context for the lived experiences of people in the region over space and time and allow improved modeling to anticipate future changes in precipitation and water access.

The human gut microbiome is a community of bacteria and other microorganisms that has co-evolved with humans and plays important roles in metabolism and health. Rapid global industrialization has led to changes in diet, lifestyle and medical practices, all of which may shape the early life development of the gut microbiome and its contribution to energy storage and fat deposition. This doctoral dissertation research project examines how infant feeding and care shape the development and energetic function of the gut microbiome and infant growth and fat deposition. The findings can inform the understanding of how evolutionarily novel environments interact with biology and culture and influence the development of the human microbiome and its contribution to growth in early life. The project provides training and mentoring in STEM for female scientists and involves science and public health outreach in local communities.

This project integrates approaches from biocultural anthropology and evolutionary medicine to understand how early environments shape infant growth and metabolism through the gut microbiome. The primary aim of the project is to examine the impact of different complementary diets (an infant’s first non-milk foods) and antibiotic exposure on infant growth and the composition and energetic function of the gut microbiome during the weaning period. With a longitudinal cohort of mother-infant dyads in urban and rural settings, the investigators use next-generation sequencing and targeted metabolomics approaches to measure the composition of bacterial communities and short-chain fatty acids (markers of microbial energetic activity) in infant fecal samples. The investigators also collect qualitative and quantitative data on infant diet, health histories, antibiotic exposures, adiposity and growth rates from 4 to 8 months postpartum.

Every thought, memory, and decision that someone experiences is created by different parts of the brain. And while great progress has been made in understanding the functions of diverse brain networks, their evolution remains less well characterized. This doctoral dissertation project focuses on a crucial network in the evolution of intelligence, the cortico-striatal system (CSS), which mediates learning and the regulation of behavior, two of the most outstanding cognitive adaptations in humans. The investigator measures the neuroanatomical variation of the CSS across many primate species, thereby enhancing our understanding of the evolutionary changes in the brain that led to the emergence of human intelligence and cognition. The project also includes public science outreach activities and generation of open source data. This research also has impact beyond the anthropological sciences by informing clinical research on species-specific vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases and addiction.

This project studies the relative size and connectivity of the CSS across primates. As specific subregions of the striatum mediate different modes of learning and stages of behavioral control, the investigator quantifies the variation of the relative volumes of the three striatal nuclei to understand how CSS-based learning and behav-ioral optimization have evolved in primates. The connectivity of the striatal subregions is measured across pri-mates to elucidate selection on cortico-striatal pathways that may relate to species-specific behavioral de-mands. The project employs phylogenetic comparative methods to model changes in scaling and rates of evolu-tion of functionally specific components of the CSS at different taxonomic levels (e.g., primate order, anthro-poid suborder, human genus).

Both humans and non-human primates have evolved defensive adaptations against malaria via changes in the genome. This doctoral dissertation research uses comparative primate data to advance knowledge about the co-evolution of primates and malaria or similar parasites, including how malaria has impacted the evolution of the primate immune system and identification of genetic mechanisms underlying the immune response to blood stage malaria. The project outcomes may inform public health relevant research on the human response to malaria. The project also supports outreach efforts that focus on increasing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM research through K-12 outreach and computational genomic capacity building. 

Using a comparative functional and evolutionary genomics approach, the researchers identify primate genes and pathways that are differentially expressed in response to malaria infection, including those with species-specific involvement in malaria response. The researchers also identify signatures of malaria-imposed changes across primate genomes. The study outcomes can advance understanding of how the primate immune system has evolved in response to this host-pathogen arms race. The analysis uses an innovative approach to investigate primate malaria response in natural transmission systems. This study can help to determine which malaria responses arose through the host-pathogen coevolutionary arms race as well as explore how human and primate evolution has been impacted by the selection pressure of malaria.

"The specimens held in natural history collections are the documentation of the world’s biodiversity, including what the species are, where they live, their life history, and their relationships with other organisms. The specimens and the information associated with them are a timeline that records the changes in flora and fauna that have resulted from growing human populations, changing land use patterns, habitat alterations, species extinctions, and the introduction of invasive species. These specimen records are invaluable and irreplaceable, but they are also irrelevant unless they are both secure and accessible. To be secure, specimens must be protected from environmental hazards such as heat, humidity, light, and pests. Accessibility encompasses equally the physical availability the materials for researchers to study through visits and loans as well as free and open access to the data associated with the specimens using information technologies. The process of photographing, copying and uploading data itself requires the ability of workers to remove and handle specimens. Recording of data and quality control can be a prolonged and expensive process. However, it is also a valuable opportunity to engage with the general public in the documentation of their own biological heritage. This not only contributes to a better understanding of the inner workings of natural history collections, but how and why scientists explore the natural world.

This project will provide the physical and virtual access needed to the hundreds of thousands of beetle specimens housed in the Triplehorn Insect Collection at The Ohio State University. Beetles are the most species-rich group of plants or animals in the world, and they include many species that are serious pests of food and forests as well as beneficial species that keep pests at low population levels. The researchers in the collection will rehouse the specimens in new, secure cabinets, drawers and unit trays. The work will be coordinated with transcription of the data on the labels attached to each specimen. These data will then go through a quality assurance check before being stored in the collection’s electronic database. This information resource is open to the general public, and its contents are automatically shared with iDigBio, the national clearinghouse for biodiversity information, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the worldwide counterpart. The data associated with the collection of tiger beetles will be the focus of a citizen science collaboration. The specimens and labels will be photographed and uploaded to Notes from Nature, and with the help of lay collaborators, the data will be transcribed and then uploaded into the collection database. This work will then ensure the maintenance and availability of specimens and their data for future research, resources that are the results of more than a century of collecting effort.

The microbiome, communities of microbes that live on and within animals including humans, contributes to important host bodily functions and can be negatively impacted by disturbances in a host’s environment. In this dissertation research project, the investigator examines how anthropogenic disturbance alters the hair, oral, and gut microbiomes of three primate species living in the same region. The comparative nature of this research advances understanding about how host species-specific factors and body region-specific factors relate to microbiome diversity in the face of external disturbances. The project supports student training in STEM and public science outreach activities, and can inform primate conservation efforts for endangered species living in threatened areas. 

Recent studies have shown that the vertebrate microbiome is modified by ecological conditions, and that reduced microbiome diversity is associated with host health issues. However, despite the compelling relationships between host health, environmental disturbance, and the microbiome, comparative primate studies including microbial communities throughout the host body are lacking due to the challenges of sampling wild primates. This project examines the relationship between microbiome diversity and landscape disturbance, hair cortisol concentration, body region, and host species. The researcher collects hair, oral, and gut microbiome samples as well as hair cortisol samples from three wild primate species in the same region. Diversity of microbiome samples is analyzed by sequencing the 16S rRNA bacterial gene, a highly conserved gene found in most bacteria and archaea that can be used to identify the taxa present within the microbial communities.

Humans have a unique suite of biological adaptations, many of which can be observed at various points in the primate and human evolutionary fossil record. To investigate how and why these adaptations occurred, it is critical that scientists consider not only the fossils themselves but their ecological and environmental contexts. This doctoral dissertation project addresses important questions about the optimal time scale(s) for investigating links between early humans and their environments. The investigators use data from high-resolution geological sediments to reconstruct and analyze environmental change at various scales of observation and consider how different patterns emerge depending on scale. The project also includes opportunities for student training and mentoring, public science outreach activities, and strengthening of international research collaborations.

Interpretations of large- and small-scale paleoecological trends are developed to assess how scale may influence interpretations of mammalian dietary ecology, as well as early human environments within a relatively continuous geologic sequence where fossil apes and humans have been recovered. The investigators develop long-term, coarsely resolved dietary data for 8 herbivore lineages for periods from 13-8.5 Ma and 5.3-1.6 Ma. They develop temporally refined, short-term dietary data for herbivores from 4-2 Ma. Each fossil sample is correlated to a specific geologic horizon— and subsequently a specific date—for which detailed paleoclimatic and paleobotanical data have been published. The project enables the diets of individual animals to be reconstructed to the level of vegetation type and then be compared to outstanding paleoclimatic datasets in order to better understand prevailing modes of paleoecological change in the region. These data can advance the integration of paleoecological patterns at various temporal scales to help clarify the types of environmentally-selective forces experienced by the hominin and hominoid lineages.

Extreme reductions in body size evolved multiple times within the primate tree-of-life, a process thought to provide evidence of convergent evolution. This doctoral dissertation research project compares whole-genomes of various species to examine the evolutionary processes and biological mechanisms explaining body size reduction in primates. The project leverages historical museum collections to generate novel whole genomes of primate species that fill important gaps in genomic databases. All data generated in this study will be made publicly available to provide additional research opportunities beyond the scope of this project. Outcomes of this research contribute to the understanding of primate genetic architecture, thus allowing a better contextualization of human genomic variation in an evolutionary framework. Moreover, this project extends bioinformatics training opportunities and accessibility of students from historically underrepresented groups.
 
Convergent evolution provides compelling evidence that similar ecological circumstances can lead to similar evolutionary solutions. However, the role of natural selection in primate size reduction remains largely speculative, especially when it comes to understanding how adaptation occurs at the molecular level. It is not clear if all small-sized primates evolved such diminutive body size via changes in the same genetic mechanisms, or if changes in different combinations of genes and regulatory sequences could lead to similar outcomes. To address these standing questions, the investigators will compare whole-genome sequences of pairs of miniaturized and non-miniaturized species to access the degree of similarity at the molecular level and the pace of molecular evolution. This research specifically examines: (1) whether small-sized species share the same genetic underpinnings; (2) evidence of selection acting in protein-coding regions related to size reduction in primates. Results will inform a more general understanding of how bodily variation arises over evolutionary history.

Though humans are remarkable in terms of cooperation, there are other social mammals including some non-human primates that regularly cooperate with non-kin and at the group-level. In some species, individuals are highly collaborative within their group, while relations are hostile between groups, suggesting that competition between groups may shape the social nature of species. This doctoral dissertation research advances knowledge about evolutionary and physiological drivers of cooperation within groups in non-human primates and examines the importance of competition as a potential driver of group cohesion. The project advances knowledge about animal social behavior and provides comparative data for understanding how group membership and intergroup conflict may have shaped patterns of cooperation in humans. The project provides scientific training to students through mentorship and field experience opportunities, and aids in conservation efforts by engaging with conservation organizations and local communities.
 
This project involves the non-invasive collection and analysis of behavioral and hormonal data to investigate the theory of parochial altruism in which conflict between groups is crucial for intensifying cooperation within groups. The researchers examine whether intergroup conflict influences within-group sociality in a highly intelligent and cooperative non-human primate species that displays hostile between-group relations. The project examines the evolutionary roots and biological underpinnings of parochial altruism by a) determining whether intergroup conflict impacts within-group socio-positive behaviors, b) investigating whether, as in humans and chimpanzees, oxytocin underpins participation in cooperative group ventures such as territory defense, and c) assessing at the group level whether there is a relationship between measures of social cohesion and success in intergroup interactions.

"Natural history collections are an archive of Earth's biodiversity, informing our understanding of the planet and ecological interactions that impact society. Recent global initiatives to digitize biological collections have transformed the scope and scale of how these biorepositories contribute to integrative biological research. Interest in collections and their data is increasing, however much of the workforce capacity remains the same. Entomological collections are especially important because insects represent the most diverse and abundant group of animals with over one million known species. Insects are ubiquitous in our everyday lives and an essential part of most ecosystems. They are also important to human health, as the majority of plant pollinators, disease vectors, and agricultural pests are insects. Collections are organized and maintained only through the specialized knowledge and experience of museum personnel, generally passed directly from one generation to the next, as no formal program has existed to do this across the community. This generational knowledge transfer has been especially important in smaller collections with limited staff, which represent ~70% of all U.S. insect collections. Despite their size, these collections are often extremely valuable due to their strong regional holdings. This effort will produce a comprehensive program to provide formal best-practices training, both in-person and online, to collections personnel, as well as providing much-needed networking opportunities for collections workers across career stages and institutions to share their knowledge and experience with the broader collections' community.

This award supports the progressive advancement of the Entomological Collections Management Workshop Series, including virtual participation and material, co-sponsored by the Entomological Collections Network (ECN) and the Systematics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (SysEB) Section of the Entomological Society of America (ESA). The workshops are scheduled to take place annually in summer 2022 to 2024, with hosting rotating between the Yale Peabody Natural History Museum, Cleveland Museum of Natural History, and Arizona State University. The workshop will be developed as a hybrid virtual and in-person event. During the 3-4 day workshop, participants will receive training in entomological collections management covering a wide range of topics, various topics including policies, specimen handling, curation, conservation, and digitization. This project will encourage the participation of collections staff managers and students associated with smaller collections, as they often have with more limited resources for training and collection development. This workshop will also help fund participation by students and early career researchers, the largest and most diverse (in terms of gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic background) segment of the collections management community. The professional development opportunities provided by this workshop will thus lead to a more highly skilled and integrative community of collections management personnel. The virtual components of this workshop will be shared to the broader community through the ECN website, with the results of in-person workshops also presented at the ECN annual meetings.

"This project will upgrade the physical storage and begin the long-term process of digitizing the Paleozoic stratigraphic fossil collections at the Paleontological Research Institution, which are currently in danger of physical deterioriation and data loss due to inadequate storage and lack of digitization. The Carl Brett and Gordon Baird Devonian collection will be upgraded to the highest curatorial standards and its associated data digitized and made more widely known and available online to the research community and general public. This collection documents the unique invertebrate fossil record of the Devonian, ~418 to 358 million years ago, of the northeastern United States, particularly New York, which is widely regarded as one of the most stratigraphically complete in the world. The project will greatly increase the accessibility and discoverability of these collections for studying a variety of important paleobiological topics, including: 1) community-level stasis and change, 2) niche evolution in response to major sea-level/ climatic change and invasion of new species, 3) morphological stasis, and 4) environmental change and evolution/ extinction of marine biotas. The project has two broader impact components: 1) construction of an online field guide to common New York fossils, and 2) development of a series of educational videos. These complementary resources will highlight both the geologic context and diversity of invertebrate fossils in the Brett and Baird Devonian collection.

To ensure that the considerable research and educational value of the Brett and Baird Devonian collection is realized, this project will 1) upgrade the physical storage of the ~4,000 invertebrate fossil assemblage samples in the collection by moving them to a newly renovated climate-controlled facility, and 2) encourage use of the collection by digitizing and sharing records publicly online via data aggregators, such as the System for Earth Sample Registration and iDigBio. The project will also provide value-added geo-referenced data to the estimated 2,500 localities in the collection. Beyond improving the storage conditions and accessibility of the collection, this project will build on the Paleontological Research Institution’s strong history in developing free, online educational resources about paleontology and the fossil record. Specific outreach activities include creating a collection of five short (3-5 minute) videos with closed captioning for the public that will highlight the Brett and Baird Devonian collection. This series will be called “From the Field to the Cloud” and will detail the journey of an individual fossil as it travels through the steps from first discovery, to curation, to its final online representation in a publicly accessible online database. A new Devonian Atlas of Ancient Life will also be developed featuring at least 200 commonly encountered species from the Devonian fossil record of New York to help everyone from avocational collectors to museum professionals identify and learn more about fossils from the state.

Puberty is known to be affected by nutritional status and psychosocial stress, but less is known about the role of rural environments and, specifically, exposure to chemicals that disrupt the endocrine system. This biocultural doctoral dissertation project explores how living in rural communities shaped by industrial agriculture impacts human growth and development. The investigators compare pubertal timing in agricultural communities that have high levels of endocrine-disrupting chemical exposure to non-agricultural communities in low-exposure areas. The research contributes new knowledge about variation in patterns of human reproduction, growth, and development. The findings can inform public health policy and public science outreach.  The project includes the design of K-12 curricula on human biology and pesticides. Individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM include participants in the study as well as researchers who will be trained and mentored by the investigators.

 Endocrine-disrupting chemicals like pesticides can disrupt hormones that regulate puberty, are energetically costly to detoxify, and increase chronic disease risk in adulthood. The investigators use silicone wristbands and gas chromatography to measure exposure to endocrine-disrupting pesticides through skin or respiration among girls in communities with high and low pesticide use. The researchers evaluate and control for the roles of nutritional status, assessed using anthropometry and 24-hour dietary recalls, and psychosocial stress, measured using a variety of validated instruments. Participant observation is used to understand the local sociocultural context and differences in lived experiences between girls in the agricultural and non-agricultural communities.

A life course framework views biological well-being as more than just a consequence of an individual’s immediate environment. This doctoral dissertation project analyzes how urban growth and climate change affected human biology in the past by examining both the timing and pattern of physiological stress responses that manifest across a lifespan. The project represents a large scale bioarchaeological integration of radiogrammetry methods with markers of skeletal stress. The examination of biological impacts of urban growth and climate change in the past provide a baseline for human experiences with stress reaction and disease processes prior to modern medical intervention and vaccination protocols. The results have the potential to inform modern public health research and policy in an increasingly urban world facing new climatic challenges. The project supports undergraduate and graduate training and a number of K-12 and public science outreach efforts. 

This project collects bioarchaeological data from two archaeological sites to test two conceptual life course models related to human biological well-being. The critical period model draws a link between early life exposures and later adult health while accumulation of risk considers how continuous and later stress exposures compound into differential patterns of health. Non-specific markers of skeletal stress that occur during different development and growth periods, as well as independent markers of infection, and radiographs are collected for individuals representing multiple time periods in the historic past. Statistical models are used to explore the co-variance of stress markers and how patterns of stress exposure at different times result in differential morbidity and mortality profiles. A life course perspective combined with paleodemographic analyses offers new perspectives on changing health dynamics in light of the demographic, climatic, and social changes occurring over time.

Research on primate biological variation can be used in a comparative framework in human evolutionary studies and to provide excellent opportunities for student training and mentoring in STEM. This doctoral dissertation project examines primate body composition differences through non-invasive measures to better understand body shape, size and physiology. The study advances knowledge about the relationship between physiological biomarkers and muscle mass and the development of sex differences in body composition, with the potential to inform research on human physiology and health. The findings from this study are disseminated through presentations at scientific conferences and publications in scientific journals, recommendations for zoo husbandry and primate conservation efforts, and outreach to the general public in popular science articles and zoo talks. Undergraduate students, including individuals from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, are involved in the data collection, analysis, and dissemination efforts of the project.

Male bimaturism is an intriguing aspect of orangutan biology and there is still much that is unknown about the flanging process and the physiological differences between the two morphs. Flanged males weigh approximately twice as much as adult females and unflanged males, but it remains unclear if this weight gain results from increased bone, muscle, or fat mass, or a combination of the three. This project analyzes creatinine and C-peptide of insulin levels in the three adult morphs of orangutans to assess relative levels of muscle and fat mass, respectively. It also utilizes body weights and testosterone levels in males to further assess these biomarkers of body composition. The investigators hypothesize that the body composition of the different sexes and morphs reflects their distinctive reproductive roles and social behaviors. While both male morphs compete for mating opportunities with females, they use different strategies, which are suggested by their respective morphological and physiological traits. Thus, the investigators predict that flanged males are more muscular than either unflanged males or females, that female orangutans possess greater fat deposits than either male morph, and that males in particuar experience a decline in muscle mass associated with age.

"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). Differences in morbidity and mortality are influenced by genetic, hormonal, behavioral, and environmental mechanisms. In nearly all living human populations, females experience longer lifespans and lower mortality risks, but perhaps unexpectedly, greater morbidities at some ages compared to males. This doctoral dissertation research explores sex differentials in mortality risk (i.e., frailty) to advance knowledge about the advent and nature of the culturally-dependent female mortality advantage. Analyses of skeletal collections from past populations are used to examine temporal and contextual information on past biological and social factors that increased mortality risks and affected demographic trends. Anthropological work on the production of health disparities in the past can aid in the management of modern public health challenges, including the production of current differential health outcomes. Additionally, the research highlights the connection between context-specific gender formations and physiological well-being. The project also supports student scientific training and public science education and outreach activities. 

The project examines the relationship between gendered experiences and physiological outcomes by examining skeletal markers of morbidity, mortality, developmental stress, and pubertal timing, using estimated sex as a proxy for gender. The researchers investigate the antiquity of the modern female mortality advantage (i.e., did females live longer, but have poorer overall health?) by elucidating the biocultural and environmental factors involved in the production of sex-based survival advantages. The project uses demographic data (age and sex) and markers of skeletal stress to examine sex differentials in mortality risk across time periods and regions and assess pubertal timing to better understand sex disparities in standards of living. The project utilizes statistical models (hazards analysis) suited to paleodemographic data, in conjunction with skeletal and contextual evidence.

The new herbarium space will dramatically improve the security and longevity of the collection, and provides additional capacity for research, education, specimen imaging and databasing, and continuing public engagement.  Two ongoing education programs will be enhanced and will include a collaborative specimen imaging project involving developmentally disabled students, and a local 5th-8th grade “STEM Girls” program.  

This three-year project will support moving the herbarium into the new and vastly upgraded space by providing a compactor system and modern herbarium cabinets.  The current storage conditions are very poor, resulting from frequent water leaks and several catastrophic flooding events, which have caused severe damage to most of the cabinets.  These circumstances have left the collection vulnerable to further damage from water, humidity, insect infestations, etc.  The herbarium also has specimens that are currently stored on open shelves and are effectively unavailable to researchers or the general public.  In addition, ca. 12,000 bryophyte specimens will be curated, imaged, and databased.  These specimens, collected by notable bryophyte specialists Margaret Fulford and Jerry Snider, will be made accessible to researchers and the general public through the herbarium databases and iDigBio.org.  Finally, Fulford’s ca. 3,500 technically detailed illustrations will be scanned and made accessible.  Thus, this project will facilitate the herbarium’s ongoing commitment to open the museum doors to the world by creating a modern, user-friendly facility and sharing its invaluable collection of specimens and illustrations through online, publicly accessible portals.

"This project will enable online access to a unique, irreplaceable resource for comparative studies of the evolution and development of the vertebrate brain. The R. Glenn Northcutt Collection of Comparative Vertebrate Neuroanatomy and Embryology, housed in Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), is the world’s largest and most taxonomically diverse collection of histological preparations of developing and adult vertebrate brains mounted on glass microscope slides. It is of particular interest and relevance to the current generation of neuroscientists who use molecular and genetic approaches to elucidate mechanisms underlying evolutionary innovations, but the slides are fragile and access to them is difficult and time consuming. By utilizing a whole-slide-imaging workflow developed through a novel collaboration with Harvard’s Center for Brain Science, the project will allow professional scientists, educators and students to easily and routinely access the slides’ content via high-resolution digital images. Such access will facilitate use of the slides in research and education and complement novel technologies for studying brain structure, development and function. It will facilitate collaborations between the neuroscience and biodiversity communities and, together with other projects that seek mass digitization and sharing of biological collections, it will enhance the ability of natural history institutions to more fully serve both science and society beyond their traditional constituencies. Indeed, the project’s imaging workflow and associated training components offer an exemplar method for rapid and cost-effective digitization that can be used by other institutions, whose slide holdings number in the millions, most of which remain dark data.

The project will use a high-throughput, semi-automated slide scanner to make high-resolution digital images of the approximately 33,000 glass microscope slides in the Northcutt Collection. When completed, the project will provide online access to approximately 500,000 serial sections and whole-mount preparations of adult brains and embryos of more than 240 genera and 270 species of living vertebrates. A cost-effective whole-slide imaging workflow will be utilized to process as many as 360 slides/week while yielding excellent image resolution (0.2 and 0.4 μm/pixel at 40X and 20X magnification, respectively). A digital image of each slide will be served to potential users via two online portals: MCZbase, the Museum of Comparative Zoology’s permanent specimen database; and MorphoSource, an NSF-supported online repository for specimen digital imagery. Both portals will be configured with Girder and SlideAtlas, two open-source software tools for whole-slide image viewing, downloading and analysis. In addition, for as many as 20 species widely used to teach comparative vertebrate anatomy, digital images of a subset of histological sections labelled to point out principal brain regions will be uploaded to BrainMaps, an online resource for vertebrate neuroanatomy. Finally, the project will produce several resources for training both students and professionals in methods for mass digitization and computer-assisted visualization of slide collections regardless of subject matter. These resources include four “how-to” videos, two online tutorials, undergraduate and graduate student internships and a graduate-level course in museum studies.

"Toxic microalgae have serious adverse effects varying from fish kills to human illnesses caused by the consumption of shellfish contaminated with algal toxins. The economic impact from blooms of these algae can be devastating to fishing and shellfish industries and tourism. Over the years, much effort has been dedicated to researching new methods for the detection, prevention, and management of toxic algal blooms to mitigate their ecological and economic consequences. The Algal Resources Collection (ARC) is the only public culture collection in the U.S. focused on the growth and maintenance of toxic or otherwise harmful microalgal species covering a broad taxonomic and geographic range. Many of the species hosted at the ARC are challenging to find in other public collections and include strains used in the description of several new species that can be found nowhere else. The ARC cultures have been extensively used by the national and international research community in studies encompassing diverse subject areas, including ecology, taxonomy, phylogeny, and toxicology. Additionally, ARC researchers and staff are involved in outreach activities that involve various educational levels, including K-12 teachers and students, undergraduate, graduate and PhD students.

This project supports updates to the operation of the ARC through the implementation of automated imaging flow cytometry and cryopreservation capability to increase the efficiency in the day-to-day activities and better serve the research community. The imagery flow cytometry will allow for more efficient quality control of the cultures and provide additional information on microalgal strains (i.e., morphometric data, cell biovolume, maximal cell abundance, image libraries) that will be made freely available on the ARC website. Cryopreservation storage capability will allow the ARC staff to continue incorporating strains into the collection and bring many advantages, such as protecting the cultures against genetic changes and avoiding loss of strains due to errors during transferences. The project also extends the scope of the ARC outreach and educational activities by increasing toxic microalgal awareness among K-12 students through the development of an educational e-game to teach kids about the importance of reducing the nutrient load to water bodies to decrease the frequency and magnitude of toxic blooms.

"The goal of this project is to transfer a large research collection of yeasts from Ontario, Canada to UC Davis. Yeasts (single-celled fungi) have great importance for life science research, industry, and natural ecosystems. They serve as degraders, nutrients, mutualists, competitors, parasites & pathogens. These important aspects of yeast ecology were elucidated in recent decades by several key researchers, including Herman Phaff (1913-2001, UC Davis) and Marc-André Lachance (University of Western Ontario). Lachance isolated, characterized, and preserved thousands of yeast strains between 1977 and 2014. He retired in June 2020 and seeks to transfer the collection to a public repository to make them available to the scientific community. Several aspects of this collection make it particularly valuable. It contains 330 type strains including the original type specimens of the 150 species that Lachance described, dozens of undescribed species, and strains that originated from 48 countries. Extensive characterization data was gathered. 5,000 yeast strains comprising the Lachance research collection will be transferred to the Phaff Yeast Culture Collection at the University of California Davis, the fourth largest of its kind in the world, with over 9,000 strains in the public catalog. This transfer will make the Lachance yeasts and associated data available to the research community for the first time, enabling use in a broad range of research fields such as taxonomy, ecology, physiology, comparative and functional genomics, and biogeography. 

Collection maintenance protocols of the Phaff Yeast Culture Collection follow relevant best practice guidelines to ensure the yeast strains meet the needs of the users: they are viable, pure, of the declared species, are backed up remotely, their characterization data are available to the user community, and handling, distribution and use comply with regulatory requirements such as biosafety, biosecurity, and Nagoya Protocol. Yeasts from the Lachance collection will therefore be accessioned into the Phaff collection under the collection’s standard protocols. Specifically, strains will be inventoried then shipped to UC Davis. Strains will be cryopreserved in triplicate: working and backup stocks at UC Davis, and a third copy cryopreserved off-site at the USDA National Laboratory for Genetic Resource Preservation in Fort Collins, Colorado. The viability, purity and species ID of each strain will be validated. Each strain will be identified by ribotyping using next generation sequencing by our collaborator Novozymes, Inc. at their research facility in Davis, CA. Strains that pass quality control criteria will be added to the Phaff collection public catalog and the Global Catalog of Microorganisms. DNA sequences will be deposited in GenBank. In addition to the already databased geographic and host material information, over 40 years of unpublished physiological data (up to 80 descriptors per strain) will be entered into the BioloMICS database and published in the Phaff collection online strain catalog. This multi-step process ensures that Lachance’s yeasts will continue to spark discoveries by future generations.

Throughout human history, many factors have influenced an individual’s mobility and diet, and in many cases, dietary practices have diverged alongside changes in other factors such as social status and belief systems. Using bioarchaeological research methods that combine skeletal analyses with aspects of environment and culture to examine diet and burial style at the population and individual levels, this doctoral dissertation research examines how social reorganization affected a broader community in past human populations. Exploring dietary choices during life and status after death advances knowledge about how food and burial practices relate to and reaffirm social roles. Broader impacts of the project include STEM training of a female graduate student, strengthening of international scientific research collaborations, and dissemination of research to the public.

The project explores the relationship of belief systems and social status to diet, origins, and mobility. The investigators consider these dynamics in conjunction with age, sex, and status for two skeletal samples representing religious elites and non-elite individuals, respectively, from the same community. The research examines whether there are dietary differences based on potential status differences and whether place of origin can be identified for non-local individuals. The project utilizes a combination of biochemical, geospatial, and statistical methods, including four isotopic discriminants (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and strontium), the Bayesian FRUITS mixing model, and geospatial analysis of the study region.

This doctoral dissertation project reconstructs evolutionary relationships among ancient populations of Homo erectus, a pivotal human ancestor, using dental and skeletal data. The project integrates paleontological and population genetics approaches for reconstructing evolutionary history, thereby advancing knowledge about how hominins, including our species, Homo sapiens, evolved. The project promotes interdisciplinarity by using approaches typically used in the field of bioarchaeology, increases diversity in the field of paleoanthropology by supporting the scholarship of a female paleoanthropologist, and fosters international research collaborations. The investigator conducts public and K-12 science outreach through a weblog about human evolution and through science activities with middle and high school students.

Homo erectus, represented in the hominin fossil record, is morphologically diverse through both time and space. The current understanding of how populations of H. erectus were related to each other is limited. Bony and dental anatomy provide the primary basis for assessing evolutionary relationships between populations in the fossil record, but the genetic basis of anatomical traits is not always well understood. This research examines H. erectus temporal and geographic patterns in the relationships among past H. erectus populations using biodistance methods and comparative data. Matrices of dental and neurocranial shape distances will be compared separately using Mantel tests to a matrix describing the temporal, geographic, or genetic distances between populations.

This doctoral dissertation project advances knowledge about the relationship between tooth root shape variation and feeding adaptations in living primates and fossil hominins, to advance knowledge about feeding and diet during human evolution. The project uses methods and works with collaborators from a variety of fields including paleontology, anthropology, anatomy, and primatology, providing integration and cross-disciplinary perspectives for understanding human evolution. The project supports graduate and undergraduate training, including individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM research, and the investigator has developed student and public science outreach activities plans well as contributing to primate conservation efforts. 

Previous work in primatology and paleoanthropology has considered how tooth crown shape affects the efficiency of processing foods during feeding. However, teeth are subject to an equally important, competing functional constraint; while teeth must function to fracture food items, they must also avoid being fractured themselves. This proposal seeks to answer whether: 1) variation in premolar form is mechanically related to resisting tooth fracture during feeding on mechanically resistant foods; and 2) variation in premolar tooth form explains mechanically significant feeding behavior in fossil hominins. The project integrates morphometric and engineering analyses coupled with observational behavioral data to test hypotheses concerning the functional relationships of premolar root form, a character featured in many hypotheses about early hominin phylogeny and adaptation. The project also integrates multiple types of data analysis including biomechanical analyses, three-dimensional shape analyses and primate behavior videographic analyses, ensuring a robust and comprehensive approach. Additionally, methodologies from several fields are incorporated, including biomedical science and engineering, biological anthropology, anatomy, primatology, and evolutionary biology, which provides the potential for collaboration among scientists across these disciplines.

Modern humans are longer-lived relative to non-human primates and often remain active at advanced ages. However, the evolution of differences in the biology and timing of aging in humans is not well understood. This doctoral dissertation uses laboratory-based cellular experiments to identify elements of the human genome that act as ‘switches’ to regulate aging. By defining how the genetic sequences of these switches have evolved in humans, the investigators add to the current understanding of human senescence and life history evolution. The focus on cellular aging processes also may inform other basic and clinical research communities. In conjunction with museums and pedagogical centers, the researchers develop exhibits and online learning materials to highlight this research on the evolution of human aging and evolutionary theory more broadly. The project involves the training of undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM, for careers in biological anthropology and related fields.

The observation of elongated lifespan in humans relative to chimpanzees suggests evolutionary differences in the biological mechanisms of aging. One hypothesis is that during the evolution of the genus Homo there may have been deceleration in cellular senescence. In this project, the researchers use the human knee joint as a model system for examining tissue decline and dysfunction. Experiments are performed to generate dysfunctional knee cartilage cells, using next-generation sequencing assays to characterize shifts in cell regulatory networks, both in the expression of proteins and how the genes encoding these proteins are regulated, that define the senescence process. This experimental dataset is then combined with computational genetic analyses to understand the role of human sequence evolution in modifying these networks and the consequences to tissue decline that may have resulted. These publicly-available datasets can serve as an important resource for research in the fields of biological anthropology, aging, gene regulation, and joint biology. Given the dearth of comprehensive datasets for joint tissue cells, particularly in the context of aging and cellular senescence, this research is of potential interest to the biomedical community and those studying age-related joint diseases such as osteoarthritis.

This doctoral dissertation research investigates how group-living primates decide where to sleep at night, and how their choice of where to sleep influences their sleep quality. The project considers how physical features of the environment as well as the differentiated and multi-faceted social relationships that are characteristic of primate group mates impact this important decision. By investigating the consequences of this choice on sleep quality, the research provides a comparative perspective for understanding how early human ancestors survived night predation and obtained sufficient sleep while doing so. This project supports STEM research capacity building at the field site as well as interdisciplinary research opportunities to both undergraduate and graduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM. There are plans to share products of this research with academic and public audiences through scientific manuscripts, public lectures, and popular-science blog contributions. 

Like other savannah-dwelling primates, baboons seek refuge at night in trees and on cliffs to mitigate the risk of nocturnal predation. When choosing a spot in which to sleep within the nighttime refuge, baboons face not only a heterogeneous physical environment that could create asymmetries in the perceived quality of sleep spot alternatives, but also a variable ecological context and dynamic social environment that could further modulate the preferences and availability associated with each sleep spot. Despite substantial research interest, practical limitations have prevented a systematic investigation of how primates navigate this critically important, yet complex decision-making landscape. This project combines traditional field methods in primatology with the latest technological advances to overcome practical limitations, allowing investigators to (1) characterize baboons’ sleep spot preferences; (2) assess how individuals update their sleep spot choices in a dynamic social environment; (3) determine whether acquiring a preferred sleep spot translates to a measurable benefit for sleep; and (4) test how the perceived risk of predation affects sleep spot decision-making dynamics and sleep quality. The project uses methods in field primatology to describe the group's social dynamics, 3D laser scanning to assess metrics of sleep spots, thermal imagery and convolutional neural networks to track baboons' decisions throughout the night, accelerometry to evaluate sleep quality, and predator playbacks to manipulate the perceived risk of predation. By examining these aims using olive baboons, the collaborative and interdisciplinary research informs discussions of how early human ancestors may have made complex decisions when they were most vulnerable.

Understanding the role of the natural and cultural environments in early life growth and development is important for advancing knowledge about human biological variation and plasticity. This doctoral dissertation project utilizes a biocultural framework to investigate early life exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which may have longer-term consequences for human physiological function. The investigator is examining the impacts of EDC exposure on infant hormonal profiles, adding to an understanding of global and temporal patterns in exposure to EDCs as well as the sensitivity of the developing endocrine system to EDCs. The project provides training in a STEM field to a female graduate student and involves outreach in a local community. The researcher is also creating informational reports to deliver to stakeholders and is collaborating with local organizations to generate recommendations for policy change based on the results of the study. The project also includes science outreach to middle school students and the general public through various science communication initiatives. 

The primary aim of this study is to quantify the effect of EDC exposure on infant hormonal profiles in different environments. Using a novel, nontargeted metabolomics approach, the investigator is quantifying EDC exposures across three biological matrices and two environmental sampling methods from mother-infant dyads. The investigator is drawing upon theoretical frameworks employed in biocultural research to understand and interpret the impacts of EDC exposure. The project builds on the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease Hypothesis by investigating the sensitivity of the developing endocrine system to EDCs using hormonal and exposure profiles. From an Evolutionary Medicine perspective, the project also addresses whether current sources and levels of EDCs overwhelm evolved defenses to environmental exposures, creating an evolutionary mismatch. Incorporating the concept of Locally Situated Biologies, the project includes collection of qualitative data to contextualize how patterns of exposure to EDCs as well as their health consequences are influenced by aspects of the local context.

 Movement is a fundamental aspect of primate life, as it is key to survival, reproduction, adaptation, and evolution. At fine scales, movement affects individual survival and reproduction through its role in foraging behavior, predator avoidance, and mate acquisition, while larger scale movement can influence local adaptations and speciation via its role in dispersal, population connectivity, and gene flow. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how fine and large-scale movement decisions in primates reflect spatial and temporal variability in their environment. The research provides important insight regarding human land use and its effects on primate movement, providing local reforestation practitioners key information to help direct their conservation efforts. Moreover, the project strengthens research infrastructure and contributes to the education and training of students, including individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM, and the general public. 

To evaluate environmental impacts on ruffed lemur multiscale movement, this project has two main objectives: (1) to assess how fine-scale movement varies through time and along an ecological disturbance gradient at four research sites; and (2) to examine how historic and contemporary environmental variation in the broader region explains large-scale movement and dispersal in the species. The investigators quantify fine-scale environmental differences across the disturbance gradient by using botanical surveys, monitoring monthly food availability, and assessing three- dimensional forest structure with drones. Investigators track lemur movement at each site with GPS collars; this information lets investigators identify aspects of forest structure (e.g., tree canopy cover and connectivity) that influence lemur habitat use. Large-scale landcover, land change, and forest structure is quantified with botanical surveys and classification of satellite images. The investigators use population genetic assessments to quantify lemur dispersal patterns throughout the region, followed by landscape genetic techniques to identify which environmental variables drive dispersal patterns in this species. Overall, this project clarifies how environmental variation and habitat change have influenced and continue to influence fine- and large-scale lemur movement and habitat use. Therefore, the insights derived from this project provide foundational information by which to evaluate environmental drivers of primate evolution at multiple levels.

"Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are soil fungi that associate with plant roots and improve resource uptake of the majority of plant species, including most crop plants. They also impact plant defenses and build soil quality. The functioning of AM fungi varies tremendously between species and isolates. As a result, studies of AM fungi can improve management of agriculture, grasslands and forests. Progress in understanding the importance and optimal management of AM fungi depends upon tests of AM fungi cultures. Unfortunately, few researchers have the expertise or facilities necessary to develop or maintain their own AM fungal cultures, and therefore the availability of cultures can limit scientific progress. This project will enable the study of this important group of soil fungi through support of a culture collection called the International culture collection of (Vesicular) Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (INVAM).  This is the largest culture collection of this type of fungi in the world and includes hundreds of individual isolates.  This collection will enable advancement of knowledge on AM fungal biology, genetics, ecology, and taxonomy, as well as applications of AM fungi for commercial purposes. This project will also promote the exploration of science by the private sector and by students of all ages and abilities. The project will develop modules on experimentation using INVAM cultures that support the K-12 Next Generation Life Science Standards.

"Aging is associated with biological, physiological, and functional changes that reflect evolutionary trade-offs in energy allocation across the lifespan. This project uses a non-human primate model to examine age-associated gene expression changes and to investigate the relationship between these changes and age-related phenotypic decline. This doctoral dissertation project advances knowledge about senescence and life history in primates and has the potential to aid in the development of novel life-extending therapies by identifying alterations in organ-specific gene expression that occur across the lifespan, not just in old age. The project supports a female graduate student in laboratory, bioinformatic, and statistical training. She also serves as an educator through her continued involvement in high school programs that provide students from underserved communities with mentoring and research opportunities.

Life history theory posits that evolved trade-offs between early-life growth and reproduction and later-life somatic maintenance are responsible for the timing of life history events. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these evolved trade-offs are not fully understood. Cellular senescence and the proteins secreted by senescent cells (the senescence associated secretory phenotype, SASP) are predicted to be responsible for modulating these life history trade-offs on a molecular level. This project tests the hypothesis that SASP factor expression changes with age and is associated with aging phenotypes in non-human primates. The investigator will generate cross-sectional, tissue-specific transcriptomic data that will be used to characterize changes in SASP expression with age, sex, and tissue type. The researchers will then calculate measures of age-related phenotypic decline to evaluate whether changes in SASP expression are associated with aging phenotypes.

"During hominin evolution, the transition to upright posture and bipedal locomotion was associated with many anatomical changes. This doctoral dissertation research project examines an understudied aspect of inner ear anatomy that contributes to our sense of balance during movement. The investigator compares aspects of inner ear anatomy for humans, primates, and fossil hominins, and examines its relationship with head and neck posture and cranial anatomy. Results from this project advance our understanding of how anatomical structures associated with balance changed with the transition to bipedalism during hominin evolution and may allow for better reconstructions of postural behavior from fossil specimens. The project also contributes to medical treatment by providing insights into the potential for vestibular dysregulation in humans and creating a quantifiable and reproducible visualization of vestibular anatomy that aids precise surgical targeting and development of vestibular prostheses. During the course of the project the investigator will incorporate 3D printed models, illustrations, and animations of the results into public outreach programs in New York City designed to teach human evolutionary concepts to the public. These include programs at the American Museum of Natural History; undergraduate courses at Lehman College; and an undergraduate seminar on the use of multimedia and interactive design in science education.

The vestibular system consists of the semicircular canals (detecting angular acceleration) and the otolith organs (detecting linear acceleration and head tilt relative to gravity) housed within the bony vestibule of the inner ear. In contrast to considerable study of the semicircular canals in primates, the comparative functional morphology of the otolith organs is largely unknown. This knowledge gap has limited our understanding of the evolution of primate, and more specifically human, head and neck posture (head positioning and range of motion). This project uses both Micro-Computed Tomography and Synchrotron Resonance Phase Contrast Imaging to create a morphometric model of the encasing bony morphology (bony vestibule) specific to otolith organ geometry in order to investigate the evolution and functional morphology of the bony vestibule in humans, primates, and fossil hominins. The investigator examines modern human bony vestibule variation and function, consider correlations between bony vestibule morphology and head position and anatomy in a comparative primate sample, and compare modern human and reconstructed fossil hominin bony vestibule features. The research clarifies how the vestibular system and head and neck posture changed alongside one another throughout human evolution and allow future study into the way(s) bony vestibule morphology is correlated with extant primate and reconstructed hominin postural behaviors.

"Millions of people were displaced due to slave trade during the 15th – 19th centuries. These systems profoundly influenced population dynamics as enslaved people were transported thousands of miles from their homes and experienced restricted social life and mobility in enslavement. This doctoral dissertation project examines skeletal morphology of these enslaved people and their descendants to understand how certain biological groups formed and changed over time, explores gene flow and other evolutionary processes that may explain how the biological variation is distributed, and investigates patterns of biological relatedness that may not be reflected in historic migration data. The project supports the doctoral training of a student from an underrepresented group in science, a multi-point research collaboration, outreach with community members, and student mentoring. The project also develops curricula and seminars in collaboration with the University of Florida’s College Reach Out Program to increase postsecondary admission and completion for students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM research. 

This project’s theoretical framework is rooted in stochastic microevolutionary expectations and diaspora studies. Microevolutionary processes such as population stratification are inferred from the premise that gene flow, rather than natural selection, is the main influence on observed biological patterns. Further, interpretations gleaned from the project derive from slave trade history, where European nations directly influenced the gene flow of the diaspora populations that formed across the Atlantic. The project asks two central questions: (1) What African and Afro-descendant diaspora groups show high biological relatedness as estimated by cranial morphology, and how do these data identify evidence of gene flow not otherwise described by historical migration data? and, (2) Given the social and legal restrictions that created physical separation among enslaved persons, do diaspora groups show stronger evidence of population stratification and genetic isolation than African groups? To investigate these questions, this project applies geometric morphometric methods to collect 3D landmarks from adult human cranial remains and uses these data to statistically analyze within-group and between-group variation in cranial morphology. Data will be collected from twenty-one sites, comprising cranial remains of 805 adult African descendants. These samples represent a variety of regions.

"Studies of the microbiome have shown that gut microbe communities can affect a host’s ability to harvest energy and store fat. However, the significance of gut microbiome plasticity and its relevance to host survival when faced with environmental fluctuations in nutrient availability remains unclear. This doctoral dissertation research uses evolutionary and ecological approaches to examine gut microbiota changes in wild primates that cope with extreme variability in forest fruit production, resulting in substantial fluctuations in caloric intake and major shifts in the types of foods available for consumption. This study advances knowledge about primate microbiome adaptations, which may also provide comparative data for examining adaptations in the hominin lineage and microbiome function in modern humans. The project facilitates doctoral degree completion for a woman and first-generation student and provide field, laboratory, and bioinformatics training for students from groups underrepresented in STEM research. The project also enhance research capacity at the research location through training workshops and collaboration.  

Orangutans cope with environmentally-induced variations in diet, such as reductions in caloric intake by up to 48%, and fall short of their energetic requirements for several months out of the year. Because gut microbiota have the potential to be powerful drivers of orangutan energetics during periods of fruit scarcity, this study investigates whether gut microbial community compositions change across marked fluctuations in nutritional intake, and also whether those changes result in increased energy harvest and microbial energy production. More specifically, this project (1) monitors environmental changes in fruit availability; (2) uses observations to estimate food intake and match intake with known nutritional values; (3) identifies gut microbial compositions from fecal samples using Next-Generation DNA sequencing; and (4) approximates microbial energy production by measuring short-chain fatty acid concentrations in fecal samples.

"Viruses and bacteria are thought to have played an important role in shaping primate evolution, but many open questions remain about how pathogens have acted to change primate genomes and influence trait diversity. More can be learned about the types of pathogens that have been most important in primate evolution, the types of genetic variants that have arisen to deal with these threats, and whether genetic variation in immune genes influences fitness-related traits in the present. This doctoral dissertation project studies the regulation of genes involved in immune defense in a wild primate system, focusing on an intensively studied population for which demographic, behavioral, and physiological data are also available. The doctoral student investigates how natural selection has shaped the gene expression response to pathogens in the past, and examines associations between immune-related gene expression variation, dominance rank, and other physiological characteristics. The project supports student mentorship and training opportunities, international research collaborations, and public science engagement through museum and conference events. 

The investigator measures genome-wide gene expression in either the presence or absence of stimuli that model bacterial or viral infection, for 160 individually recognized adult baboons. Differences in immune responses are examined for linkages to genetic differences between baboons, controlling for age, dominance rank, kinship, and other factors that also influence immune function. Integrating these findings with genome sequences from the same baboon population, the project investigates whether genes involved in the immune response to bacteria and/or viruses have been the target of historic or recent selection and tests whether genetic variation that influences the immune response also affects traits that are important to current physiological wellbeing and fitness.

"As the nose is responsible for heating and humidifying air before it enters the lungs, geographically-patterned variation in nasal morphology has long been attributed to climatic adaptation. However, previous research has also shown that the nose must be large enough to take in a sufficient amount of oxygen during each breath to meet life-sustaining metabolic requirements. Accordingly, this doctoral dissertation project examines the combined effects (and possible functional trade-offs) of demands for respiratory air-conditioning and oxygen intake on the nasal complex during human evolution. By explicitly investigating climatic adaptation in nasal morphology within the context of human body size and shape, this study helps address how different anatomical systems have co-evolved in response to environmental pressures. Computed tomography (CT) scans generated for this project will be made freely available to other researchers through established online archives, substantially expanding the geographic/temporal diversity of CT scans currently available to anthropologists and the broader scientific community. This research also provides training opportunities for undergraduate and medical students (including those from under-represented groups) and the investigator will incorporate project findings into ongoing public outreach initiatives including K-12 science education programs, museum-based community engagement, public lectures, and online podcasts.

Despite substantial evidence that both climatic and metabolic pressures have likely influenced human nasal anatomy, the interplay of these two factors on nasal size and shape during human evolution is not fully understood. This study employs a ""whole-body"" approach by quantifying variation in cranial and post-cranial skeletal morphology in a large, geographically- and temporally-diverse sample of recent and fossil Homo. Using established equations, body mass and basal metabolic rate will then be calculated from post-cranial measurements and employed in conjunction with nasal and climatic variables to statistically assess whether: (1) nasal morphology exhibits stronger associations with metabolic demands than other aspects of the craniofacial complex; (2) climate and metabolic demands differentially influence particular aspects of nasal morphology; and (3) deviations from climatically predicated nasal morphology in fossil Homo (particularly Neanderthals) are attributable to greater energetic requirements.

"In animal species, a variety of social and physiological cues are thought to convey information about an individual’s health, status, rank, or reproductive fitness to other individuals. Many primate species, for example, rely on social cues about status and rank of other group members to gauge competitiveness and mate quality, which requires the ability to keep track of multiple individuals. However, there may be an upper limit to how many individuals can be recognized. In this doctoral dissertation project, the investigator studies a primate species with very large group sizes to examine whether male chest patch coloration may replace social knowledge of rank as a signal of male competitive ability. The project directly engages with evolutionary theories about trade-offs between social and morphological indicators of reproductive fitness, specifically advancing knowledge about the social and ecological environments that favor the evolution of costly visual signals (like chest coloration) relative to social knowledge as a means to appraise fighting ability of competitors. While conducting the proposed research, the investigator continues her involvement in local public science engagement to help foster an interest in science among young students of all backgrounds, improve science literacy in her local community, and promote open science communication to build trust between researchers and the public. 

The colored patch on the chest of male geladas has been hypothesized to be the product of sexual selection -- a quality signal to ward off would-be rival males. This research empirically tests the relationship between the intensity of male chest color, physiology, and reproductive fitness in a wild population of geladas. The investigators first examine what might cause red chests at a mechanistic level by analyzing color-gauged photographs taken from individually-known adult males to determine if male redness is associated with testosterone levels and/or gene expression related to vascularization and blood flow in the local tissue. At a functional level, the investigators then use demographic data paired with individual male redness to determine whether redder chests are associated with a longer reproductive tenure for those males, and whether this contributes to more offspring in the long-term, as determined by paternity testing of all infants.

"Biological adaptations are often observed to have evolved multiple times within a group of species. This phenomenon may be related to the occurrence of particular co-occurring traits within a group of species that make the evolution of some adaptations more likely than others. Among primate groups that use suspensory locomotion, this pattern of movement seems to have evolved multiple times independently. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how covariation among biological traits within the forelimbs of primates affected the trajectory of their evolution. The project contributes to an emerging understanding of how covariation of traits impacts the evolution of new body plans, in particular the evolution of humans’ distinct form of upright walking. In addition to training a graduate student, this project generates a large dataset that can be used to train undergraduate and high school students in study design, statistics, and computer coding. The doctoral student plans to publish short, public-oriented video abstracts of this project’s results, creating a direct link between active scientists and the public.

This project studies how changes in the way biological traits covary can affect the trajectory of evolution, potentially making specific adaptive suites more common in certain clades while inhibiting their evolution in other groups. The investigator plans to collect 3-dimensional data on the forelimb bones of primates from across the order, use evolutionarily informed statistics to identify traits that are associated with frequent suspensory behaviors, and examine how these traits covary in suspensory taxa and their close relatives using matrices. Different hypotheses about the evolution of suspension in primates predict different strengths and patterns of trait covariation in suspensory vs non-suspensory groups. The extent to which the common ancestors of humans, chimpanzees, and other apes were adapted for suspension is under active debate. By studying how suspension evolved in primates, this study will contribute to our understanding of early human evolution.

"The Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas at Austin (UTEX) is one of only a handful of curated, public, biodiversity collections of living algae. UTEX is a repository and distribution center for algal biodiversity. The UTEX Collection is of the most genetically diverse assemblages of organisms available to the public and many of the algae UTEX maintains are unique and irreplaceable. Every year UTEX distributes thousands of living algal cultures, at modest cost, to scientists, educators, and students throughout the U.S. and the world. The great interest in microscopic algae as sources of transportation fuel, human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, and many other uses makes UTEX algae and services essential resources for hundreds of research projects. UTEX provides hands-on workshops on managing algal cultures, an informative interactive web site, species identification services, chemical composition analysis, and extensive correspondence with students engaged in algal research. UTEX personnel give presentations at public schools, conduct tours of UTEX facilities, assist teachers and students in conducting high school science projects, and provide presentations on the scientific importance of algae to hundreds of children every year at local open house events.

UTEX currently maintains more than 3,000 unique living algal strains representing all major taxa, including over 450 type species. The UTEX mission is to promote, support, and enable the use of algae for research, education, and practical applications. In order to fulfill its mission, UTEX provides living algae to a user community at modest cost; serves as a permanent public repository of newly discovered and recently described algal species of potential value representing a broad range of genetic, morphological and biochemical diversity; acts as a source of information regarding algae to practicing scientists, other professionals, and the interested public; promotes and supports local science teaching and hands-on scientific activities by school children; and provides practical training services, support services, and supplies that facilitate culturing of algae at other sites.

"Natural history collections document life on earth, past and present, and represent an invaluable and irreplaceable resource for the study of biodiversity. Proper and long-term management of natural history collections, including both physical specimens and their associated data, is crucial for scientific research by contemporary and future researchers. The Collection of Fishes at Texas A&M University is a substantial university-based ichthyology collection that has experienced rapid growth over the last 20 years. This collection serves a dual research and teaching role on the Texas A&M campus and more regionally, acting as both reference collection and specimen repository for researchers at other universities in Texas and other southern US states. A major goal of this project is a collection-wide physical re-organization and re-curation of specimens, coupled with a database platform migration that will safeguard the physical and digital content of this collection, facilitate growth, and broadly improve capacity to serve the national and international ichthyological research community as well as a growing community of non-traditional users of specimen data (e.g., K-12 educators, artists). Goals also include training of undergraduate students and Texas Master Naturalist volunteers in natural history specimen curation and management, novel undergraduate student course assignments and K-12 science-based art workshops focused on vertebrate natural history and ichthyology, and development of a temporary public exhibit showcasing the rare specimens from this university-based collection.

"The skin microbiome — the collection of microorganisms that live on the surface of the human body — plays a critical role in regulating the immune system, yet little is known about how infants first acquire skin microbes in early life. Since microbes are transmitted between people, and human infancy is highly social, interactions with caregivers may be a critical component of infant skin microbiome development. This doctoral dissertation project examines how infant social networks and specific interactions between infants and their caregivers influence the diversity of microbes living on infants’ skin. Results of this project shed light on the understudied relationship between social behaviors and the infant skin microbiome, as well as laying the foundation for future studies that connect early life microbial exposures to particular physiological outcomes. Study participants, including mothers and other caregivers, will receive personalized reports based on research results, including information about their social networks as well as the structure of their skin microbiome and how it compares to that of their infant. This project also contributes to enhancing diversity and inclusion by training undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM research in skin microbiome laboratory methods and statistical analyses. The project also has public health translational potential with respect to infant wellbeing.

Unlike other great apes, human mothers rely on additional caregivers, such as grandparents and older siblings, for long-term assistance with infant care. Common infant care practices, including holding and carrying, promote direct skin-to-skin contact between caregivers and infants, suggesting opportunities for skin microbes to be shared with infants. This project will investigate how social caregiving influences the infant skin microbiome, with an emphasis on the microbial similarity between the skin of infants and their caregivers. Researchers will collect skin swab samples from infants, mothers, and additional caregivers, and use microbial gene sequencing to characterize and compare the skin microbes present in the samples. Caregivers will complete questionnaires that ask about the frequency of specific practices that put them in physical contact with infants. The researchers will use these data to generate social networks that describe social relationships between infants and their caregivers, suggesting potential routes through which skin microbes are shared with infants. This project offers a novel perspective on the benefits of social caregiving to infants, and the results will highlight the role that the social environment plays in linking early life microbial exposures to health outcomes.

"Natural history collections record the world’s diversity through time and support the scientific community’s understanding of changing ecosystem dynamics. In the face of declining insect biodiversity worldwide, it is more important now than ever for entomology collections to preserve, digitize, and disseminate specimen data to the broader community. The Frost Entomological Museum at Penn State cares for more than 1.3 million specimens that span the diversity of insects. This collection stands to grow further, through the incorporation of satellite collections of pollinators, especially bees (more than 125,000 specimens), and through the activities of the Insect Biodiversity Center (IBC), a recently established research initiative at Penn State. The infrastructure provided through this grant increases the storage capacity of the Frost by 50%, allowing for the curation of these collections and to serve as a repository for scaled up efforts to understand insect diversity through time. The award also provides the resources to digitize the substantial aphid collection (approximately 224,000 specimens on 49,000 slides), which holds important data regarding these insects’ plant hosts, and aquatic insects (approximately 100,000 specimens in 15,000 vials), which are indicators of habitat health. These improvements will facilitate research that addresses native pollinator decline, epidemiology, global climate change and its impact on species distributions and invasive species, niche restrictions, indicator species, and the evolutionary history of insects. The project will also generate data that contribute to ongoing research on imperiled insects and will fill critical taxonomic, geographical, and temporal gaps in existing datasets.

A high-density compactor storage system will be installed in the Frost Museum in order to accommodate new rows of cabinets for pinned insects. These cabinets will accommodate approximately 1,600 drawers of expanded space. A portion of this storage will be utilized by incorporating the pollinator collection previously housed at Penn State’s Fruit Research and Extension Center and specimens generated by Penn State’s Center for Pollinator Research. The aphid collection, which consists of slide-mounted specimens, will be imaged on a flatbed scanner and then moved to new custom-built slide cabinets. The slide scans will be transcribed in the Frost Museum database, georeferenced, and the data shared with iDigBio and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The aquatic insect collection likewise will be imaged and rehoused in new, expanded ethanol storage. The lot images will be transcribed, georeferenced, and the data shared with the above repositories, making them accessible to the public.

"The Duke Lemur Center is responsible for two unique and irreplaceable collections: the largest living population of lemurs outside of their native Madagascar and a natural history collection that includes one of the most diverse primate fossil collections in the United States. The fossil collection – with specimens from the United States, Egypt, Madagascar, and Colombia – helps researchers use the tree of life to connect lemur research to other primates, including humans. Unfortunately, some of the most important fossils at the DLC, including some of the oldest lemur fossils and some of the oldest monkey fossils, are actively breaking down because unstable salt minerals were embedded in the specimens during fossilization. This project is a rescue mission to stabilize and preserve these fossils in physical and digital form. Highly trained fossil technicians will remove salt minerals from the most endangered specimens and store the revitalized fossils in new specimen cabinets that better control the temperature and humidity around the specimens. The team will also create 3D scans of the specimens using x-rays. The scans create a back-up record of the fossils in case they continue to deteriorate. The scans will be uploaded to MorphoSource, an online repository that allows educators, students, and researchers to examine fossils in 3D from any device with internet access. With a better-stabilized collection, the DLC fossil collection can open to the public for in-person and virtual tours, and online exhibits and curriculum guides will be created by the DLC education team using scans and 3D prints.
 
The most unstable fossils in the collection come from Locality 41 in the Fayum Depression in Egypt. The site is one of the most fossil-dense terrestrial Paleogene localities in Africa. Along with primates like Catopithecus and Plesiopithecus, the site preserves giant hyraxes, rodents, bats, snakes, birds, and carnivores. The tennis-court sized fossil deposit in the Western Desert of Egypt was actively quarried in the 1980s through 2010s. The most fossil-rich sections were targeted by the excavation teams. This makes the collection at the DLC irreplaceable through additional fieldwork. This project partially supports a Fossil Preparator who will focus on the Egyptian collection as well as other unstable materials in the collection. It also partially supports a Digital Tomographer who will use the Duke microCT scanner to generate scans of the most at-risk specimens, and the DLC Data Manager who will work with the Tomographer to backup and upload scan data to MorphoSource. The data manager will lead the effort to add higher resolution specimen data to the DLC Specify database, which will integrate with iDigBio (idigbio.org) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (gbif.org). The project also supports microCT scanner access and new specimen storage cabinets. The DLC education team will use these newly stable specimens to create curriculum-targeted tours and guides for North Carolina K-12 students and visitors to the DLC. Ultimately, exceedingly fragile fossil specimens will be available in-person and online to researchers, students, and the general public.

This doctoral dissertation research project examines how wild Kinda baboons’ movement strategies vary according to the distribution of resources in complex environments, and how their dietary choices affect the distribution of bacteria in their guts. Results from the study will provide important insights linking evolutionary strategies to search for foodstuffs to physiological outcomes in a social primate. While conducting the work, the doctoral student will participate in educational science programs for under-served K-12 students and engage in public science through scientific blogs and social media. Additionally, the project will provide scientific training opportunities for diverse undergraduate students and a U.S.-based graduate student. 

The research investigates how the distribution of key nutritional resources – food and water – affect how baboons move through their environments. Research suggests that consuming different dietary resources impacts primate gut microbiomes, the microorganisms inhabiting the gut, which, in turn affect primate biology and health. This research uses data drawn from individual baboons residing in natural settings to complement scholarship that is based on environmental and climate proxies rather than direct evidence of nutritional choices. It also adds an explicit focus on water - a critical resource in dry environments and a source of gut bacteria - to understand how diverse dietary choices among individual baboons relate to gut health. The investigators will follow a habituated troop of Kinda baboons to collect behavioral (e.g., diet and movement) and biological (e.g., baboon fecal and water sample) data. Next, they will employ cutting-edge movement ecology analyses (e.g., hidden Markov models) to test different hypotheses related to baboon movement strategies. They will then quantify baboon microbiome diversity and analyze its relationship to water microbiome diversity and pathogen levels (e.g., E. coli and Giardia abundance).

"This research will salvage and restore a biological research collection critical to understanding the southeastern US flora, make data of this collection widely accessible to researchers, and engage the next-generation of biodiversity scientists. The 20,000 specimen collection, the Lord Fairfax Community College herbarium (LFCC), deeply documents vascular plant species from a historically under-collected US region, the Blue Ridge physiographic province of northwestern Virginia. In 2019, Lord Fairfax Community College donated LFCC to the George Mason University herbarium (GMUF) to safeguard the collection for posterity. LFCC contains numerous high-quality specimens that represent newly discovered county- and state records that expand the Atlas of the Virginia Flora and the Flora of Virginia. Such information is essential for understanding the ecology and evolution of the southeastern US flora and for managing natural resources in one of the nation’s biodiversity hotspots, which is under increasing strain from human modification. This research will ensure that LFCC receives the repair and modern curation it desperately needs in order to be fully utilized as research infrastructure. The combination of LFCC and GMUF will create the third-largest herbarium in Virginia. The co-location of these significant research materials will increase their impact on biodiversity and ecological studies in Virginia and the southeastern US for the foreseeable future. 

The research project will use an efficient workflow to salvage LFCC and its detailed collection notebooks, digitize these data to share with the scientific community and the public at large, and educate students about the importance of natural history collections in scientific research. LFCC specimens will be repaired, annotated, and physically filed with those of GMUF under archival conditions. High-resolution images of LFCC specimens and their label metadata will be disseminated publicly through the SERNEC TCN Symbiota LFCC portal and iDigBio. In order to extend the impact of this research resource, the LFCC collection notebooks will also be digitized and linked to specimen records. Undergraduate students from underrepresented groups and one graduate student will be trained as curatorial assistants over the two-year project period. Project personnel will develop an educational module using LFCC specimens, whose goals are to develop undergraduate students’ awareness of collections’-based research and the extended specimen concept. Multiple outreach events are planned that will engage the broader university community and the public through the Notes from Nature online community science platform using the established Plants of Virginia herbarium label transcription project. A series of public presentations and articles about the results of the project are planned for academic and non-academic audiences.

"Aspects of lifestyle play an important role in shaping how individuals age, but most of what we know about human senescence stems from work with industrialized populations, who do not represent the full range of lifestyles modern humans engage in. This doctoral dissertation project will examine human aging in a non-industrialized population, and evaluate how aspects of lifestyle contribute to age-related patterns of physical and cognitive function. This project will help create a broader picture of how humans experience growing older across a range of biosocial contexts, and so advance our fundamental knowledge about human senescence. The project will inform public health research by examining whether certain aspects of aging can be mitigated through elements of lifestyle. Furthermore, by employing an interdisciplinary approach to the study of aging, this project will strengthen research infrastructure ties among several institutions and departments, and also contribute to the professional development of women in STEM fields. 

In industrialized populations, growing older is associated with declines in physical and cognitive function that limit independence and increase risk of disability. Large-scale epidemiological studies indicate that engaging in high levels of physical activity (PA) may attenuate age-related declines in function. It is not clear, then, whether the age-related functional declines seen in industrialized populations are inevitable aspects of human senescence or by-products of sedentary industrialized lifestyles. This project will examine variation in lifestyle and aging in hunter-gatherer populations that currently include members who continue to engage in full-time foraging, and others who engage in more market-integrated lifestyles with less reliance on foraging. The project tests the overarching hypothesis that variation in engagement in traditional foraging practices is associated with distinctive PA profiles that benefit age-related patterns of physical and cognitive function. Researchers will recruit participants (ages 18+) from communities who engage in different amounts of foraging, and participants will complete tests of physical and cognitive function. Participants will also wear an accelerometer for several days, allowing researchers to characterize patterns of PA. The researchers will compare age-related patterns of function for non-industrialized and industrialized populations, as well as assess whether amount of foraging is related to variation in age-related patterns of function. They will also use formal mediation analyses to assess how patterns of PA influence the relationship between age, function, and amount of foraging.

Given our rapidly aging global population, it is imperative that we understand which aspects of human aging are indeed inevitable, and which may be modifiable. Decades of research highlight the importance that elements of lifestyle play in shaping health throughout life. However, most of our understanding of what ""normal"" human aging look like comes from work with industrialized populations, who do not represent the enormous variety of ways modern humans live. In order to create a more comprehensive understanding of how elements of lifestyle impact human biology throughout life, we must broaden our study of human aging to include populations who engage in different kinds of lifestyles.

The Hadza are a population of subsistence-oriented foragers who live in northern Tanzania and are known for being highly physically active throughout life. Changes to their environment over the past several decades have challenged the Hadza’s traditional way of life, and as a result, many Hadza women and men engage in a variety of subsistence practices. Our goal is to examine variation in lifestyle and aging among Hadza men and women who engage in different amounts of traditional foraging practices. Here, we test the hypothesis that variation in foraging engagement is associated with distinctive physical activity (PA) profiles that benefit age-related patterns of physical and cognitive function.  

To test this hypothesis, we measured PA and physical and cognitive function with Hadza men and women (ages 18+) living in 12 different communities (or ""camps"") in northern Tanzania. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that Hadza men and women living in different types of camps (i.e., more foraging-oriented ""bush"" camps versus more settled ""village"" camps) do not engage in different amounts of PA&mdash;we found that Hadza living in all camp types were highly physically active, even over the age of 60. We also found that some measures of PA were associated with measures of function. Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was positively associated with performance on a test of spatial working memory, and daily step count was positively associated with a test of walking endurance, even when controlling for the effects of age. In fact, daily step count partially mediated the negative effect of age on walking endurance, even within this highly active population.

We believe that this project, by providing a cross-cultural perspective on human aging, has relevance not only for Biological Anthropology, but for public health more broadly. Our project contributes to a growing body of work with subsistence-oriented populations that highlights the complex effects that market integration can have on a population in transition. Furthermore, our project examines the relationship between lifestyle and aging outside of an industrialized context, and so contributes to our ability to differentiate between which aspects of aging modifiable, and which are not.

In addition to meeting our intellectual merit project goals, we accomplished our goals for generating broader impacts from this work including providing invaluable experience in fieldwork, project management, and professional development for a female graduate student. Our project was also able to directly contribute to the communities we work with by providing Hadza men, women, and children access to medical care and treatment that can otherwise be extremely difficult to obtain.

"An award is made to the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) to establish a dedicated laboratory for the isolation of ancient DNA and proteins preserved in biological tissues and environmental samples. Ancient, often poorly preserved, tissues provide a treasure trove of previously inaccessible molecular information on the history of life on Earth. The new AMNH facility will be a national resource, providing the research community with an ultraclean lab in which students, early career scientists, and established scientists can undertake supervised extraction of degraded biological materials under best-practices conditions. In addition to the physical laboratory, this award will support activities to strengthen national expertise in ancient biomolecular research through the production of training materials and a symposium in which experts share their knowledge with novice and experienced practitioners. This project will have broader educational impact through programs for students and teachers, including open-access teaching resources that increase awareness regarding the utility of ancient DNA and proteins in modern science. 

Recent advances in DNA sequencing, proteomics, and bioinformatics have enabled extraordinary advances in understanding the history of life and its diversity on Earth. Yet the full impact of these tools has not been fully realized in historical biology and related disciplines, such as archaeology, paleontology, paleoecology, paleoclimatology, and physical anthropology. This is partly because ancient biomolecules, recovered from macrofossils or sediments, require specialized treatment: they tend to be highly degraded and easily contaminated by modern biomolecules. Only a handful of labs in the USA are capable of meeting the highest standards of specimen preparation, and access to these facilities is currently limited. This project will bring a uniform level of support to researchers from across the country who are interested in utilizing ancient biomolecular information in their investigations. The AMNH Ancient Biomolecules Facility is intended to make available to visitors a uniquely designed clean room and cutting-edge instrumentation for biomolecular extraction and quality assessment for genomic and proteomic applications. On-site extraction and safe handling of ancient DNA and proteins will greatly simplify researchers’ investment in the time and effort needed for optimal data acquisition, circumvent lengthy permitting processes, and expedite the dissemination of results to the scientific community. Serving as a national center for ancient biomolecular extractions, the AMNH facility will also act as a clearing house for biomolecular studies, providing training to students and other practitioners, fostering collaborations, developing new techniques and standards, and promoting the value of ancient biomolecules as an investigatory tool.

"Humans thrive in diverse and extreme environments around the world thanks to biological and social mechanisms including adaptation by natural selection, habitat construction, and cultural innovations. While many studies have investigated the genetic basis of adaptation to extreme environments, there is much to be discovered about how social and cultural processes also interact to contribute to human survival and flourishing. This doctoral dissertation project combines genetic, archaeological, ethnohistorical, and ethnographic analyses to investigate adaptation through time to both natural and social environmental pressures. The multifaceted approach of this project will advance the understanding of human adaptation as well as expand the currently limited representation of Indigenous peoples of the Americas in genomic studies of human variation. The project provides mentorship and training in anthropological genomic methods to graduate and undergraduate researchers and contributes to community and public science outreach efforts.

This project employs biocultural theoretical frameworks to integrate evidence from archaeology, ethnohistory, ethnography, and genomics and develop a more complete and nuanced picture of human survival and flourishing in extreme environments. The study employs next-generation genome sequencing technology, isotope and radiocarbon analyses, statistical tests for natural selection, and reconstructions of population history to assess genetic variation and identify genes under selection in ancient and contemporary Indigenous peoples over a timespan of about six thousand years. These data will be used to shed light on possible parallel adaptation in extreme environments where cold temperatures and limited diets may have had similar effects on human populations. Additionally, this study will investigate adaptation after European contact when the introduction of novel diseases may have acted as a strong selective pressure.

"The colobine monkeys, a group of primates closely related to apes and humans, are species-rich and widespread globally.  Despite an abundant fossil record demonstrating a greater ecological and geographic range in the past, their evolution remains poorly understood.  This project will first determine the evolutionary relationships between the fossil and living colobines, then use these newly understood relationships to test long-standing hypotheses about the evolution of colobine habitats, diet, distribution, and diversity. Using newer methods and including recently described fossil material will provide a much-needed update on colobine evolution from earlier analyses and contribute significantly to our broader understanding of primate evolution.  The methods used in this project will be evaluated for their applicability to other areas of primate evolution as well, including early human evolution.  This project will also provide multiple opportunities for mentorship and public outreach by using charismatic primates to discuss primate biology, human evolution, and evolutionary theory more broadly.  Outreach will continue at events hosted by New York City public schools, CUNY colleges, and the American Museum of Natural History and research opportunities related to this project for high school, undergraduate, and master's students will be provided, emphasizing broadly applicable skills in computer coding, statistical analysis, critical thinking, and research design.  All products of this project, including raw data and computer program scripts, will be made available in public repositories to encourage further work on these relatively under-studied primates. 

This project will explore the evolutionary history of the colobine monkeys, a widespread and diverse primate radiation.  In contrast to the primarily folivorous and arboreal extant colobines, fossil colobines are known from a wider geographic range and exhibit a range of inferred substrate preferences and ecologies.  However, the evolutionary context of this diversity is largely unknown as the relationships between the fossil and living colobines are still poorly understood.  This project will first conduct a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the living and fossil colobine monkeys and subsequently use the inferred tree(s) to explore long-held hypotheses about 1) the evolution of substrate use, 2) the number, timing, and route of dispersals between continents, and 3) the pattern and timing of colobine diversification in the context of Mio-Pliocene climatic events.  Fossil and extant colobines will be scored for phylogenetic analysis and a set of functional postcranial measurements will also be taken.  Parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses will be performed on both the morphological data only and in total-evidence analyses incorporating molecular data.  A Bayesian tip-dated tree will be generated and used to explore changes in diversity through time, examining possible correlations with major climatic events.  Biogeographic history and the evolution of substrate preference will be explored by mapping character state changes and inferring ancestral states using both parsimony optimization and Bayesian modeling.  Character matrices and program codes will be made available to allow the incorporation of this work into a broader understanding of Mio-Pliocene catarrhine evolution.

"Primates depend heavily on plants resources for food in subtropical and tropical forests. However, the way in which overall forest structure and function is related to primate ecology and behavior is not fully understood. Tree species differ in their traits, some of which affect plant growth and survival (e.g., leaf mass), while others (e.g., fruit sugars) negative or positively affect primates. A ""trait landscape"" results from tree species' spatial distributions and traits, including phenological activity (e.g., flowering). This doctoral dissertation project examines how the constellation of plant traits in forests that primates inhabit affect primate diet, nutrition, and mating patterns such as monogamy. This project contributes to professional development and STEM education of undergraduates and assistants from local communities. International collaborators, including students and assistants, will obtain hands-on training in canopy access techniques, drone remote sensing, and programming using Python. The project will also support K-12 curriculum development and primate conservation in the study region. 

The goal of this project is to identify important ecological correlates of primate diet and monogamous mating system, by carefully considering and incorporating the bottom-up roles of plant traits and the spatiotemporal details of forest ecology and composition. Specifically, the project will examine the bottom-up effects of a tree community’s spatiotemporal distribution of functional and trophic effect traits on the nutritional ecology and mating pattern of Azara's owl monkey (Aotus azarae azarae). The researchers will (1) consider the owl monkeys' diet and nutritional ecology in a forest ecology context by considering the functional ecology/trait space of the tree community, and juxtapose their findings with those of traditional nutritional ecology analyses, and (2) assess how and why functional and trophic effect traits are equally distributed over space and time in gallery forests, with pair-living and a monogamous mating system as corollaries. The researchers will collect standardized plant samples and analyze these for functional traits, nutrients, and plant secondary compounds. They will furthermore assess the spatiotemporal details of species distribution and phenology through drone remote sensing, and statistically analyze spatial, nutritional, and community ecology parameters.

For this project, the co-PI, Griette van der Heide, spent a total of 17 months at the Owl Monkey Project in Formosa Province, Argentina. Field work was completed at the end of June 2021, after intermittent and sparse access to the field site due to the global coronavirus outbreak. During this period the co-PI and her local team collected tree functional trait data (e.g., crown volume, fruit weight) from 67 species, of which more than 50% were sampled multiple times. She furthermore georeferenced sampled trees and transect points to align on the ground tree species observations with remotely sensed imagery for tree classification purposes.

While in Formosa, the co-PI fully trained three research assistants/students from la Universidad Nacional de Formosa (UNaF) and partially trained four other assistants from Argentina, and one from Canada, in tree climbing techniques. Several practice climbs were done on public land (riverine forest, UNaF terrain) or in neighborhood backyards, providing opportunity to give impromptu canopy access demonstrations, dissemination of research objectives, and general information regarding owl monkeys to local Formosenos/Chacoans. Three assistants continue to work on primate research and/or canopy access outreach.

Assistants were furthermore trained in primate observations, tree identification, field equipment use (e.g., telemetry, compass, binoculars, GPS, camera traps, clinometer), as well as phenology, whole tree, fruit, and leaf functional trait measurements. Four assistants were trained in basic drone operations (sensor/drone system set-up, drone/flight tracking). Though formal workshops were impossible in Formosa during the pandemic, informal one-on-one trainings were done on general data management, the use of reference managers, as well as Python scripts &minus; specifically to clean and report phenology data.

The co-PI's activities in Formosa have also led to collaborations with various UNaF professors; botanists regarding tree identification and newly registered plant species in Formosa, Dr. Juarez (primatologist) regarding a long-term seed bank/species conservation project, as well as forestry professors regarding general Chaco (canopy) ecology. The co-PI's professional relations at UNaF and her social network resulting from her Formosa-based research team strengthened her connection with people from the Gran Chaco, and her knowledge of the Gran Chaco ecosystem.

Despite setbacks caused by the pandemic, precluding the execution of certain field and lab components, we were able to preserve the scope and topic of this project by collaborating with various entities from which we obtained data as partial replacements for on-site data ('Planet' for satellite imagery, 'TRY' for species trait data). To deepen discussion, the co-PI has established a database (&gt;1000 records) on feeding information, including plant species and parts consumed, from all studied Aotus spp. across the Neotropics to which our results can be compared. She is furthermore broadening her dissertation by writing a reflective chapter on what the pandemic meant for research and forests in the Argentinean Gran Chaco. While the co-PI is still analyzing data and writing scientific articles, she has nearly finished a modelling approach to identify tree species &minus; based on traits like basal area and fruit crop &minus; as likely candidates of 'monogamy resources' under the resource defense hypothesis of monogamy. This included extended Python modelling of several rarity and dispersion indices, as well as a comprehensive measure of 'resource reliability.' The resulting Python code serves to a priori predict which tree species may help maintain primate monogamy but can more broadly be applied for primate conservation purposes at any site with vegetation data.

We furthermore disseminated our general research ideas and focus to the global tree climbing community at a joint event by the Global Organization of Tree Climbers (GOTC) and the Big Canopy Campout (BCC). Both organizations are non-profits with a shared goal to bring attention to the world's canopies. At the GOTC/BCC event the co-PI presented her vision of 'Primate Canopy Ecology' &minus; a bottom-up framework for studying primate ecology without habituating primate groups. She is slated to lead a workshop on 'sampling the canopy for researchers' at an in-person GOTC meeting in 2022, which is attracting many young canopy scientists from Asia and Central- and South America. We will continue to disseminate our research to the wider public through a bilingual GOTC blog post, a news item in CU Boulder Today, a presentation at a CU's undergraduate 'Anthro Club' meeting and climbs with Colorado Girl Scouts. More specific results will be disseminated at the International Primatological Society Meeting in Ecuador, an Ecological Society of America meeting, and at least one Argentinean ecology or primatology meeting, all in the year 2022. Griette van der Heide's dissertation is to be completed in the year 2022.

"Geological and paleontological research provides a deep-time perspective of past events that can inform scientists and policymakers about the long-term consequences of environmental patterns. Of particular interest to both scientists and the general public is the relationship between environmental change and hominin evolution. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how shifts in the environment may have played a role in the origins of two major lineages of hominins, Paranthropus and Homo. By examining how the environments in which these early hominins lived changed leading up to the divergence of Paranthropus and Homo, this project provides important evidence of the impact of environment variability on a local scale, as well as insight into the evolutionary drivers that spurred the emergence of new hominin lineages. A critical goal of this project is to train a female graduate student in STEM and to create opportunities for other women and students from underrepresented groups to gain first-hand experience in conducting science through mentorship and research. It also fosters international research collaborations and academic linkages and public science outreach and engagement. 

The origin and divergence of the Paranthropus and Homo lineages coincides with a period of profound environmental variability and instability at the regional and local levels. To understand the contributing factors that may have precipitated this major evolutionary event, it is important to determine the environmental context in which the two new lineages emerged. However, the nature of the relationship between global and local-scale environmental change remains poorly resolved during this critical period of human evolution. The goal of this project is to investigate the underlying environmental factors potentially driving the emergence of Paranthropus and Homo by (1) using mesowear, microwear and stable isotope analyses to reconstruct the local paleoenvironment; (2) comparing paleoenvironmental data from other sites in the region to document patterns of local environmental change; and (3) investigating the relationship between environmental change and the extinction and speciation of hominins and other mammals.

"Behavior (how animals interact with other organisms and the environment) is critical for individual survival and reproduction, the persistence of populations/species, and the health of ecosystems. Behavioral studies seek to understand how and why animals act differently within and between populations, and to identify factors that drive the evolution of new behaviors. Yet while the current and historical distributions of species are an integral context for understanding behavioral evolution, they are often neglected in behavioral studies. Similarly, the field of biogeography ⎯ how and why biological diversity, or biodiversity, varies across the Earth ⎯ seeks to understand how biodiversity responds to natural and human-mediated change; however, such studies often do not take the behaviors that shape population- and species-level interactions into account. This project lays the foundation for developing an Institute focused on the biogeography of behavior, through the development of a shared and integrative framework for both fields that will enhance our understanding of behavioral evolution, conservation, and ecosystem processes. Activities undertaken by the Institute will include recruitment and training for students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty; development of formal case studies and activities for K-12 and undergraduate classrooms; implementation of a Broadening Bioinformatics Workshop geared towards high school students; and Institute planning activities and pilot projects. The Biogeography of Behavior Institute will merge expertise in the fields of animal behavior and biogeography to develop new empirical tests, mathematical models, and theory to enhance understanding of when and how organisms respond to rapidly changing environments.

Behavior is critical for individual fitness, and ultimately, species’ survival, and it is often an organisms’ immediate response to its biotic and abiotic environment. The historical and current geographic distributions of species are integral to understanding the evolution, development, function, and mechanisms of behavior, and behavior (dispersal, interactions within- and across-species, etc.) is in turn critical for understanding patterns in biogeography. Yet few studies of behavior integrate the biogeographic context and vice versa, leaving major gaps in our ability to interpret empirical results and develop novel hypotheses. The Biogeography of Behavior Institute will bring together scientists from multiple disciplines to develop a comprehensive foundation for integrating the fields of animal behavior and biogeography. Through such integration, the Institute will span questions from cellular to global scales, examining links between genotype and phenotype, adaptability and resiliency across communities, and developing predictions for shifts in populations in response to rapid environmental change. The Institute aims to 1) foster interactions among biologists working in the evolution, development, function, and mechanisms of animal behavior and biogeography, 2) design experiments to explore geographical aspects of behavior and vice versa, and 3) bring together specialists from multiple fields to directly address questions related to large-scale geographic shifts in species distributions or behavioral patterns resulting from climate change, urbanization, and habitat destruction.

"In nonhuman primate communities, between-species competition is hypothesized to dictate species diversity and community assemblages, but there is often a lack of fine-resolution data on species interactions. This doctoral dissertation project will use innovative methods to examine the relative influences of competition and niche differentiation on the structure of a community of four nocturnal lemurs from Madagascar. Species ecologies will be described in dietary, spatial, and temporal dimensions. The project will provide extant models for identifying driving forces in primate community evolutionary history as well as critical data for informed, targeted protection of endangered lemur species. The investigator will work with local NGOs to encourage sustainable development projects in the study region. Additionally, the investigator will engage women undergraduates, including from underrepresented groups, to work on arthropod curation and laboratory analyses and will visit high schools to give lectures about conservation and career paths for women in science.  

Competition is a primary mechanism underlying current community assemblages, particularly in sympatric, closely related species. The evolutionary history of lemurs was likely defined by such competition, resulting in pronounced niche differentiation, which allowed for coexistence in sympatric lemur communities. However, these concepts remain to be rigorously tested due to a lack of fine-resolution data regarding between-species interactions within lemur communities. To fully understand these processes, the investigator will combine innovative technologies, such as DNA metabarcoding, with traditional methods, such as transect surveys, to conduct a fine-resolution analysis of the relative influences of competition and niche differentiation on the structure of a sympatric community of nocturnal lemurs. Specifically, the investigator will evaluate: 1) niche differentiation and interspecific competition as governing forces of current cheirogaleid community structure, 2) which niche dimensions (i.e., diet, space, or time) most greatly facilitate coexistence and drive competition in this community, and 3) how niche differentiation shifts in response to seasonal variation (as some species exhibit hibernation/daily torpor during the dry season). Fine-resolution niche differentiation (i.e., differentiation that would have been undetectable using only traditional methods) is hypothesized to be responsible for the development and maintenance of the current assemblage of the study community.

Using measures of tooth shape to analyze traits, and stable isotope analysis to examine diet and canopy use, this project looks at differences between primate pairs by comparing populations that live together to populations that live separately. The study can provide new information relevant to conservation management programs to prevent further primate extinction by documenting the impacts of increased competition due to habitat loss.

This project asks two research questions: 1) do closely-related primate species focus their diet on a few key food items when they live together compared to the same species when they occur separately? and 2) do closely-related primate species display morphological traits and isotopic signatures that reflect focus on fewer key resources when they live together compared to the same species when they occur separately? These questions will be tested using ecometric measures to quantify tooth shape and stable isotope data to represent diet and canopy use. By combining methods to analyze tooth shape and isotopic signatures related to habitual canopy level occupation, this project will provide new perspectives on how to reconstruct dietary behaviors and resource competition.

"Although a growing body of research has pinpointed how strong social bonds improve survival and health across both human and nonhuman primates, the importance of social connections in early life has been comparatively understudied. This doctoral dissertation project will integrate behavioral, hormonal, and immune data to quantify early-life social bonds and assess their developmental consequences in a wild primate. By studying these connections in a nonhuman primate species, this research will provide comparative data for investigations of early-life social bonds in humans. The investigator will engage in mentorship and education programs both in the U.S. and abroad, mentoring undergraduates in crafting research projects, designing science programs for libraries in underserved neighborhoods, and leading conservation education activities with local communities.

This research project will examine the role of early-life social bonds in wild, juvenile gelada monkeys. Geladas inhabit complex societies in which immatures play with both familiar groupmates and unfamiliar neighbors. First, this project will determine whether maternal dominance rank, the number of close relatives, and the presence/absence of a sibling predict the quality and/or quantity of social bonds, taking into account potential sex differences in these patterns. Second, this project will examine whether strong bonds buffer juveniles from social adversity, reducing rates of received aggression, increasing alliances during competitive encounters, and decreasing physiological stress measures. Lastly, this project will investigate the stress response’s impact on both innate immunity and adaptive immunity. While social isolation and associated physiological stress may impair immune function wholesale, it may instead lead to trade-offs between these two sub-systems, prioritizing immediately beneficial, innate immune defenses.

"The recent discovery of the hominin species Homo naledi has introduced new complexity and new questions about human evolution. In this doctoral dissertation project, the investigator will use 3D scanning technology to quantify skeletal variation across a number of H. naledi individuals and situate the results in a broader comparative primate context. Beyond providing an evolutionary context for the variation in H. naledi, this project will highlight the relationship between genetic and skeletal variation at multiple scales, which may be used to identify related individuals within bioarchaeological, forensic, and paleoanthropological assemblages. The research will generate hundreds of 3D models of three primate species, which will be made available to the public, creating new educational materials that can be 3D printed and used for lesson plans and outreach. Additionally, through close collaborations with local and international universities, undergraduates with interests in 3D imaging will continue to engage in independent research projects using these scans.

It is not known whether the recently discovered H. naledi individuals represent part of a small, isolated population or a larger, geographically diverse species that may have interacted with modern humans. In this project, the variation between H. naledi individuals will be quantified using 3D geometric morphometric assessment of five postcranial elements. Comparative modern human and chimpanzee samples containing individuals of known and unknown biological relationships will be used as baselines to explore variation at multiple scales. To this end, this project has three objectives: 1) to test the hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between genetic and morphological distance at and below the population level in modern humans and chimpanzees; 2) to quantify the variation within H. naledi and compare it to the variation calculated for modern humans and chimpanzees; and 3) to contextualize this variation by determining the extent to which H. naledi resembles biological relatives. A number of evolutionary scenarios concerning population isolation and relative size will be evaluated to determine which scenario most likely produced the variation seen in H. naledi. In so doing, this project will shed light on H. naledi’s evolutionary history and the possibility of interaction between H. naledi and modern humans.

"In nonhuman primates a range of male behaviors are observed that relate to male success in siring offspring. This doctoral dissertation research project examines reproductive payoffs of different male strategies (aggressive versus affiliative) in wild geladas (primates). Results from this study provide valuable insights about the evolution of male reproductive strategies and will enhance understanding about the adaptive significance of male-female social bonds in a long-lived primate species. While conducting the proposed research, the doctoral student will continue to work with K-12 students from underrepresented communities to foster excitement about science and research and give talks about primate behavior and evolution at local elementary schools. Additionally, the doctoral student will continue training undergraduate students in the laboratory throughout her dissertation research and mentor women from groups underrepresented in primatology.

This research investigates how different male behavioral strategies affect reproductive success in geladas. Male geladas gain reproductive opportunities by becoming the dominant leader over a family of multiple females and their offspring. Male reproduction is thus a function of the number of fertile females in the group combined with how long he remains the dominant leader (tenure length). The proposed project will use long term data (collected over 13 years) in combination with detailed behavioral, hormonal, and paternity data from individually known leader males to assess which factors contribute to male reproductive success. First, the investigators will measure reproductive success by assigning paternity through genotyping all leader males and infants in the project. Second, they will quantify physical attributes that could affect reproductive success in geladas. These include: i) body size (measured through laser photogrammetry), ii) chest patch redness (measured by comparing photos of gelada chest patch against a standard color checker chart), and iii) testosterone levels using fecal samples collected from individual leader males (measured through a biotin labelled enzyme-immunoassay). Third, the investigators will assess what social strategies males employ to increase reproductive success by quantifying male-female social relationships through behavioral observations and recording the occurrence of infanticide.

"The human pattern of growth, development, reproduction and aging is unusual compared to that of our closest living primate relatives and distinctive among primates as a whole. Humans have exceptionally long lifespans, closely spaced births, an extended period of juvenile dependence and support in raising offspring by post-reproductive females. These unique life history traits have been linked to social (shared infant care) and cognitive (e.g. innovativeness) traits observed in modern humans. This doctoral dissertation research project will use state-of-the-art microscopy and chemical methods to advance current knowledge about how modern human life history evolved, by analyzing biological ‘histories’ in the fossilized remains of our extinct relatives. The study findings may inform clinical research on hard tissue diseases associated with age, reproduction and/or metabolic conditions. This project will involve the training of minority undergraduate students at NYU in the processes of lab work and data collection. The outcomes of this research will be presented to a wider audience through museum outreach activities and international collaborations.

This project will use cutting-edge technologies to investigate changes in bone and teeth related to reproductive physiology. Bones and teeth record physiologically impactful events affecting the organism in the form of altered growth-layers. The investigator will generate histological thin sections to examine these growth layers using both optical and electron microscopy. In addition, complete elemental analysis of the growth layers will be carried out and a library of “elemental fingerprints” of the various types of events (pregnancy, menopause, sexual maturity, as well as illnesses and other physiological stressors) will be constructed. Finally, since the fossil remains of our extinct relatives cannot be physically sectioned for preservation reasons, the project will utilize extremely high-energy and high-resolution microtomography (phase-contrast synchrotron radiation computed micro-tomography) to gain access to the internal structure of teeth in a non-destructive way.  The methods developed in this project will lay the groundwork for future application to the hominin fossil record.

"Environmental factors exert considerable influence over processes of growth and development, and stress experienced in early life can have long-term consequences for health and mortality risk. It is therefore critical to understand when individuals are most vulnerable to stress exposures. Sensitive developmental windows (SDW) are periods in early life when energy needs are high, and developing tissues exhibit greater plasticity in response to stress. This doctoral dissertation project will examine evidence of plasticity in the human skeletal system using a SDW framework, in order to better understand how the timing of stress exposures in early life influence patterns of disease susceptibility and mortality risk over the lifespan. The intellectual impacts of this project will be the production of a novel framework in which to more clearly define the relationship between early life environments, biology, and health outcomes across the lifespan. Insights derived from this project about the lifetime impacts of developmental stress may inform research in human development and public health. The project will also facilitate training of undergraduate and graduate students in non-destructive methods of skeletal analysis that are broadly applicable across modern, historical, and archaeological contexts. 

This project will improve existing methods of identifying and interpreting evidence of plasticity in the skeletal system by examining a set of asymmetries in skeletal elements that capture an extended period of early child development. Evidence for plasticity will be measured through the SDW framework by calculating asymmetry indices in three skeletal samples that represent human populations engaged in different modes of subsistence, social organization, and diet (early farmers, prehistoric agriculturalists, and historic preindustrialists). These asymmetry indices will be compared across populations and assessed using childhood mortality rates, age-at-death and adult stature as covariates, so that the impact of plasticity on mortality risk over the lifespan can be evaluated. The methodology employed in this project involves non-destructive analysis of skeletal elements, providing an accessible approach to examining plasticity.

"Interactions between microbes and plants or microbes and animals are common. In many cases, both parties benefit from these interactions to the extent that they are dependent on one another and over time their interaction becomes irreversible. This project will bring together researchers working with a range of investigatory tools (such as measuring nutrient exchange, signaling and chemical communication, genomic approach, and mathematical modeling) in a range of systems (including plants and mycorrizal fungi, fungus growing ants, cockroaches with endosymbiontic gut microbes, carnivorous pitcher plants) so that they can lay the groundwork for developing a model that predicts the point of no return: that point at which the individual species in the system lose the ability to function independent of their partner. By seeking connections across the diversity of these systems, we hope to better understand the factors that lead to the development of partner dependence.  A major outcome of the project will be the development of training programs at three levels. Outreach and training will be developed for students at Metro High School in Columbus. This diverse urban school serves as a magnet for talented high school students with an interested in STEM fields. Training activities will include summer research projects in affiliated labs. A training program for undergraduate and graduate students at Ohio State University, and hold two workshops, one for faculty and students at regional universities in Ohio and one for people from HBCUs and HSIs. 

This project will develop a Biology Integration Institute application that seeks to determine the factors that push microbial symbioses past the point of no return to partner dependence. Partner dependence, which occurs when a symbiont requires an association with a partner for successful reproduction, represents a major evolutionary transition. Symbioses are complex adaptive systems, in which patterns emerge from the interactions and responses among partners and interactions between the partnership and other organisms. The development of symbioses relies on communication below the level of the organism and is often driven by molecules and cellular responses within the partners, but the advantages of the association may relate to community and ecosystem interactions, and the processes by which the partners adapt and respond are governed by evolutionary forces. Understanding and predicting the patterns of dependence and other phenomena within and across taxa requires understanding the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of these systems. While this Design proposal is focused on process instead of products, we expect to produce synthetic papers that will make connections across scales and lay the groundwork for future theory development and work in empirical systems.

"This project will design a new institute to investigate why males and females of some species differ in how long they live.  In humans, like in many other animals, females tend to live longer than males.  However, this lifespan difference between males and females is not universal. In some species females live longer, and in other species there is no lifespan difference between males and females. Why there are differences in aging and lifespan between males and females is currently unknown.  This project will address this question by bringing together experts from diverse fields of biology to form the Integration Institute: Sex, Aging, Genomics, and Epigenetics (IISAGE).  IISAGE will develop a coordinated research plan to investigate the contribution of genome instability to differences in lifespan between males and females across species. IISAGE will also establish an interdisciplinary training program for participating students. The project will conduct outreach to the scientific community through conferences and a website, and will specifically recruit underrepresented groups to participate in the institute.

Genome instability increases with age in many species and is considered an important contributor to aging.  However, there is a significant gap in knowledge concerning how genome instability variably impacts males versus females in aging and lifespan, and whether this differs across species with diverse life histories and mechanisms of sex determination.  IISAGE will build a community of scientists with various expertise in molecular biology, physiology, ecology, and evolutionary biology to comprehensively address how genome instability impacts sex differences in lifespan across the animal kingdom.  Specifically, the goals of IISAGE in the BII-Design phase are to: 1) Refine the specific questions addressed and methods employed by future IISAGE research; 2) Develop an interdisciplinary training/career development program for the members of IISAGE; and 3) Establish the procedures necessary for efficient data management and information exchange between the members of IISAGE.

"The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis changed the trajectory of life on Earth. By about 2.4 billion years ago, photosynthesis began to cause accumulation of oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere. This oxygen eventually allowed multicellular animals to evolve. However, scientists do not know when or how oxygenic photosynthesis evolved. Understanding its origin requires integrating data and ideas from biochemistry, microbiology, evolutionary biology, and Earth history. This project will bring together individual scientists with the breadth of knowledge and diversity of skills to identify and address the key questions for understanding oxygenic photosynthesis. Specifically, researchers will design a cross-disciplinary Biology Integration Institute on The Evolution of Oxygenic Photosynthesis. The team will include university students and early career scientists who will learn cross-disciplinary techniques through participation in project-related activities and as part of a graduate level course that integrates appropriate sciences. Public outreach and education projects will show others how scientists work together on complicated problems. The researchers are committed to diversity, inclusivity, and academic excellence, and they will apply best practices for broadening participation and integrating educational components into the project.
 
The researchers will establish a cross-disciplinary collaboration at UC Davis to investigate the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.

"Animals move with superb agility, achieving exceptional athletic feats of endurance, speed and rapid maneuvering through complex terrain. This requires precise coordination of muscle contraction, sensing and neural control in response to rapidly changing interactions with the physical environment. Modern science has revealed increasing detail about the molecular mechanisms, growth and function of discrete tissues and systems such as muscle, neurons and bone. Yet a pronounced gap exists in understanding how these systems work together to achieve agile whole-body movement. The Integrative Movement Sciences Institute (IMSI) will bring to together 26 faculty from 21 institutions, with collective expertise across the spectrum of movement sciences from molecular biophysics of muscle to human rehabilitation and human-machine interaction. IMSI will create a nationwide collaboration network and training pipeline from undergraduate to faculty levels, to transform our field by integrating understanding of muscle function and movement from molecules to behavior. IMSI will train the next generation of scientists in effective cross-disciplinary communication, team-based science, mathematical modeling, data analysis and open data sharing. Research activities will focus on development of integrated models of movement with a wide range of applications for human exercise sciences, rehabilitation, and mobility assistance, including the design and control of prostheses, exoskeletons, and biologically-inspired legged robots.

A pronounced gap exists between ‘top-down’ approaches that focus on whole-animal behavior but lack insight into underlying mechanisms and ‘bottom-up’ approaches that identify molecular and biophysical mechanisms but lack insight into their contributions to behavior. Muscle forms a critical link in integrating mechanics and control of movement across scales. This project will fund communication, training and collaborative research development activities over 12-months to establish the Integrative Movement Sciences Institute (IMSI) at the University of California Irvine (UCI), with 26 faculty from 21 academic institutions. IMSI ‘Design’ activities include a workshop in Spring 2021 and a 4-week long Summer Research Institute in Summer 2021. Workshop activities will encourage thinking across disciplines and developing effective team-based collaborative approaches to overcome the challenges that currently inhibit integration across fields and organizational scales.

"The concept of resilience - the ability of any system to return to a previous state after a perturbation – provides an ideal opportunity to unite different scales of biological research.  The ever-increasing specialization of scientific research has made it challenging for researchers in different fields of biology to exchange ideas. The study of system resilience, however, is common to all biological fields of study.  The overarching objective of this project is to use the theme of resilience to bridge cellular, organismal, and community-level scales of biology by synthesizing the tools, concepts, and approaches used by the different research fields. They will be integrated through 1) collaborative research that includes undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, and faculty, 2) curricular enrichment, and 3) outreach to other institutions, non-profits, and industry. Conserved mechanisms of resilience identified through these activities will be applicable to engineer and manage biological systems in medical, agricultural, industrial, and natural contexts.

This project will challenge scientists to span disciplinary, taxonomic, methodological, and other divides in biology to build and apply a unified framework for biological resilience. Many fields of biology have described resilience in their systems of study, but rarely are there integrative efforts to search for common patterns and processes of resilience across temporal and spatial scales. The first step of the project is to examine how existing models and metrics of resilience are implemented across biological scales. The second step is to determine if there are common mechanisms across scales that allow biological systems to maintain resilience. The final step will be to identify how the basic science of biological resilience can be used to design and manage cellular, organismal, and ecological systems. These areas of resilience will be examined through interdepartmental seminars in biological resilience, a regional symposium on biological resilience, a new graduate module on biological resilience, and graduate research fellowships in biological resilience.  The investigators will carefully examine and refine the existing lexicon for biological resilience that can be widely adopted by other biologists and integrative biology research institutions.

"Synthetic biology (SynBio) is a revolutionary combination of engineering and life sciences. It empowers investigators to design and build from the ground up useful new biological systems such as metabolic pathways. SynBio can also uncover the deep operating principles that underlie biological systems – the ‘Rules of Life’. This is done by applying the build-to-learn philosophy, i.e. (i) design and construct biosystems based on current knowledge of the Rules; (ii) if the systems don’t perform as predicted, diagnose why and thus deepen knowledge of the Rules. Despite its intellectual power and practical potential in metabolic engineering, SynBio has been slow to reach plant biology and SynBio training has historically been concentrated in engineering schools where women and other groups are notably underrepresented. There is consequently an urgent need to bring SynBio into mainstream plant metabolism research and diversified training, and to use SynBio’s build-to-learn philosophy to define Rules for redesigning plant metabolism. This project will accordingly harness the complementary SynBio strengths of three leading plant science universities to design a tri-campus PhD training and research program to define Rules to guide engineering of novel metabolic pathways. The project will be designed in virtual workshops, one hosted by each campus. Design goals will be to (i) integrate basic engineering skills and internships in SynBio companies into PhD training, leading to an interuniversity graduate research certificate, and (ii) develop strategies to recruit women to redress the gender imbalance in engineering. The workshops will also help plan a major 2021 Plant SynBio Conference, which Co-PI Lenaghan will chair.           


Synthetic biology (SynBio) has the power to change biology from a descriptive to a prescriptive discipline and to transform plant improvement, particularly of metabolic traits. However, perhaps because its roots are in chemical engineering, the SynBio revolution has barely reached plant science yet. To address the critical shortage of SynBio PhD training for plant scientists, and the underrepresentation of women in the field, plant scientists and metabolic engineers at three major plant science universities (University of Florida, University of Tennessee, and Purdue University) have come together in this project to pool their complementary expertise to design a coordinated three-campus PhD training and research program in SynBio. The project will hold three virtual workshops (one hosted by each university) to plan a graduate certificate in SynBio and a concerted research plan to define Rules of Life that (i) predict how well enzymes and metabolic pathways developed in microbial SynBio platforms will transfer to plants, and (ii) enable the amount, stoichiometry, and timing of enzyme activity to be adjusted to assure efficient operation of new multienzyme pathways in plants. In the certificate program, online flipped-classroom courses will be given in their areas of expertise by each university and SynBio companies will be recruited to host internships for students. Courses will cover basic coding, engineering principles, metabolic engineering, synthetic regulatory circuits, and directed evolution. The workshops will also plan strategies to recruit women. Lastly, the workshops will help plan the American Society of Plant Biologists’ 2021 SynBio Conference, which Co-PI Lenaghan will chair.

"The need for secured computer and internet storage has seen a rapid increase over time. To address this challenge, this project will develop a DNA nanotechnology-based cryptographic protocol for writing and reading digital data. It will be developed to enable both high-capacity and highly-secured information storage and high-speed information retrieval. DNA nanotechnology will be utilized to encrypt information in molecular patterns formed upon DNA folding, which is uniquely determined by a set of DNA information strands and a special folding route of DNA strands that function as the encryption keys. The programmability of DNA nanostructures creates a vast design space for the encryption keys, making it practically impossible to intercept and break the encryption. The molecular patterns on DNA nanostructures will be characterized by a super-resolution imaging method and a low-noise nanopore device. These methods can enable fast readout speed at 1 megahertz with a high spatial resolution of smaller than 10 nanometers. If successful, this DNA-based storage has a potential to be implemented on a portable platform, thus strongly supporting the development of next-generation DNA-based memories with significantly improved security and storage density at a low cost. Consequently, the secured DNA-based storage will benefit the U.S. economy and society. This research involves several disciplines including nanofabrication, materials science, biochemistry, electronics, photonics, and data science. The project will engage underrepresented groups in the research and positively impact STEM education.

DNA has emerged as a promising candidate to store information that can rival semiconductor memory, due to its high stability, high information density, and accompanying readout technologies. However, the potential of DNA as a material for highly-secured information storage has not been fully exploited. Additionally, the readout of conventional DNA-based memories has been limited by DNA sequencing, which requires special instruments and personnel training. This research is to fill the knowledge gap by creating a significantly improved and high-security DNA-based molecular cryptography and establishing a high-speed, high-resolution, and potentially portable readout platform for DNA memory. The research team will embed encrypted information in three-dimensional DNA origami nanostructures in the form of nanoscopic patterns. A pool of DNA scaffold strands decorated with specific information strands (i-strands) of different sequences, lengths, and binding positions will be designed on the basis of a chosen DNA folding scheme out of many possibilities, which will be used later in decryption of the pattern of i-strands. The high spatial resolution of DNA-PAINT (DNA-based point accumulation for imaging in nanoscopic topography) (<20 nm) and sapphire-supported nanopore sensors (<10 nm) will support high-density information decryption of intricate single-molecule patterns on the DNA origami, while enabling a fast readout speed of up to 1 MHz. The fast readout methods will employ deep-learning classification techniques for automated decryption and improved accuracy. The encryption scheme, single-molecule characterization methods, nanopore sensor designs, and data analysis algorithms will be synergistically improved in this project to enable robust and effective information storage and transmission.

In the case of animals, survival depends crucially on their ability to move around. Most animals use fins in water, wings in air, and limbs on land. But these appendages have extraordinary morphological diversity and can be repurposed for novel functions such as using fins to walk and limbs to swim. This project will establish the Evolutionary Morphogenesis and Biodiversity (EMBody) Institute to drive discoveries on how appendages are formed and used in animals. Complex and poorly understood processes, ranging across levels of organization from molecules through cells to populations and in speed from milliseconds to hundreds of millions of years, drive the diversity of appendages. The EMBody Institute will use multi-disciplinary collaborations to produce novel techniques and tools to study the processes that shape animal appendages. Additionally, learning how animals move over diverse environments can lead to improvements in the design of robots used in disaster relief by land, sea, or air. Importantly, the Institute will foster a culture of inclusivity to broaden participation in research, education, and public engagement with science.

A central question in biology is how biodiversity on Earth emerged from the complex, multi-scale interactions of biological processes with the physical and chemical environment. The Evolutionary Morphogenesis and Biodiversity (EMBody) Institute will focus on animal locomotion and the remarkable diversity of propulsive appendages, essential for movement and survival in diverse habitats. This Design proposal aims to establish a collaborative community that integrates the multiple disciplines needed for propelling breakthroughs in understanding the evolution of morphogenesis in vertebrate appendages such as fins, limbs, and wings. Appendages develop through morphogenesis, a dynamical process that integrates genetic patterning with biochemical and mechanical regulation. Form enables function but does not dictate it. Rather, physical interactions with the environment, governed by mechanical principles and neural control, leads to function. Ultimately, natural selection operates on function, and the evolutionary transformation of ancestral gene regulatory networks yields novel forms and functions. From genes at the smallest level to selection on populations at the largest scale, this inextricable loop is the central theme of the EMBody Institute. The Institute will integrate experts from multiple disciplines and multiple levels of biological organization: (i) development that drives the emergence of diverse morphologies from shared gene networks through regulation, (ii) biomechanics that generates function by neural, musculoskeletal, and mechanical interactions, and (iii) evolution that transforms ancestral gene networks to yield novel morphology and function. The collaborative activities will generate and test novel hypotheses, innovative measurement methods, and unique datasets to benefit multiple scientific communities.

"This doctoral dissertation project examines biocultural questions about how relocation affects young adults' dietary behaviors and physiology over time. Scientists have observed that elevated stress and diet change are each associated with poorer metabolic function for resettled populations in some urban settings. However, social conditions that induce these changes, and the interactive impacts of stress and diet change, are often underexplored. Using existing survey data, new data, and biological sampling, this research will advance fundamental knowledge about biosocial mechanisms that shape human biological variation. Outcomes of this project will assist with interpreting root causes of health disparities in diverse societies and may inform public health research and policy. This project will also support student training, international research collaborations, and science outreach activities.

Biocultural research in anthropology includes questions about the physiological consequences of the nutrition transition in which highly processed, nutrient-poor fast food supplants local food systems. Other research complements this body of work by illustrating the challenges of adapting to a new society, including a new food system. This project proposes that social pressure to integrate into a new society induces stress and accelerates diet change to negatively impact young adult physiological well-being. Investigators leverage previously-collected survey data from when participants relocated as children, and follow up with them in adulthood using surveys, interviews, and health assessments. With this mixed-methods approach, the project is uniquely positioned to trace and compare how diet and physiology interact and respond to new social conditions. Pairing these analyses with a health assessment can further clarify how social pressures ""get under the skin"" to stratify health outcomes over the life course.

"Recent findings suggest that intermixing with now-extinct relatives like the Neanderthals may have helped humans adapt to new environments during their rapid expansion around the globe, and may still contribute to human differences in disease susceptibility today. However, the extent to which benefits to hybridization are also found in other primates is not well understood. This doctoral dissertation project will use a model for natural hybridization in primates to investigate signatures of beneficial transfer of genetic variants between species. It will also ask whether hybridization affects hair color and maturation timing in baboons, traits that may be important in mate competition, fertility, or survival. The research will provide novel insight into hybridization’s role in primate evolution and shed light on how hybridization may influence primate diversity in the future. It will also contribute to STEM education at the elementary, undergraduate, and graduate levels through the design of new educational activities, mentored research opportunities for undergraduate students, and support for the co-PI’s PhD training. Finally, this project will facilitate public engagement with science through free-to-the-public presentations that will also be accessible online.

To investigate the potential benefits of hybridization in primates, the project will integrate genomic and observational data from wild baboons. It will test the hypothesis that hybridization facilitates the transfer of a small number of advantageous genetic variants between yellow baboons and anubis baboons. To do so, genomic data will be generated for multiple populations spanning a baboon hybrid zone. These data will be subjected to three complementary methods to identify genetic variants affected by adaptive introgression. Cases of potential adaptive introgression will be investigated for overlap with genes that are also differentially expressed between yellow and anubis baboons. The project also will test the hypothesis that genetic ancestry predicts hair color and maturation timing in a well-studied baboon population at the center of the hybrid zone. It will assess whether ancestry effects on these traits differ in number and magnitude across the genome, based on evidence that hair and skin color traits tend to have a simpler genetic basis than life history traits like maturation timing. Finally, the project will test whether regions in the genome that contribute to ancestry-related differences in hair color or maturation timing are candidates for adaptive introgression.

"This doctoral dissertation project examines how habitat fragmentation affects wild female chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), specifically assessing the consequences of forest fragmentation and food availability on female behavior and reproductive performance. The project will advance fundamental knowledge about species responses to environmental change. In addition, as human land use rapidly alters  forests, understanding how primates cope with habitat loss and fragmentation is of paramount import to their successful conservation. Results will help stakeholders develop and adopt efficient management plans for forest fragments to ensure the protection of chimpanzees and related biodiversity. This project also presents opportunities for training through public outreach and by engaging undergraduate students in field data collection and analyses. 

This study will take advantage of two forest fragments which are similar in population density but differ in terms of food abundance and proximity to a larger chimpanzee population. Fragmentation usually co-occurs with substantial loss of food resources, as is the case for one of the forest fragments under investigation. However, the other fragment is still comprised of primary forest, presenting a powerful natural experiment through which to test the effect of fragmentation independent of food availability. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that female behavior will be more impacted by food availability and isolation than fragmentation. Alternatively, female chimpanzees may have sufficient behavioral flexibility due to their fluid social system to mitigate negative consequences of fragmentation. By integrating novel and existing ecological and behavioral datasets, this project will test how habitat fragmentation impacts female chimpanzee subgrouping patterns, dispersal and ultimately, reproductive performance. Subgrouping data will be collected through full day focal follow of adult females and monthly nest surveys along line transects. Female dispersal behavior will be assessed through genetic data, which will be generated from non-invasively collected fecal samples. Finally, female reproductive performance will be characterized from two metrics: the adult female-clinging infant ratio and C-peptide values measured through non-invasively collected urine samples.

"This award will enable the Morton Arboretum to design a Biology Integration Institute that will take a multidisciplinary approach to understanding and predicting whole tree responses to rapid environmental changes, including emerging climates, biotic invasions, and urbanization, across organizational (i.e., from molecules to ecosystems) and temporal scales (i.e., from moments to generations). Trees shape terrestrial environments, both in natural and built environments, creating forests and woodlands and play a major role in global water, carbon, nutrient, and energy cycles. With their extensive root systems and expansive leaf canopies, they integrate above and below ground conditions, linking the soil and sky through a dynamic biotic system.  Tree responses to these emerging novel environments - be it an urban parkway or an increasingly dry woodland - also alter the environment they live in and generate biological innovations in traits, genes, behavior, community composition, and clades. A synthetic approach is necessary to understand these complex and contingent systems and tease apart questions of nature versus nurture and how we might best manage trees in the future. During the Design phase, the project will enhance the current undergraduate research and public outreach activities of the institution, especially with regard to individuals who are underrepresented in the sciences. 

Trees, as a growth form, are a great model system for integrative biology and the study of biotic response to environmental change. Not only do they dominate terrestrial ecosystems and form the fundamental ecological and evolutionary basis for many ecosystems, they possess numerous compelling biological characteristics making them particularly good integrators of environmental change. The researchers will design a Biological Integration Institute focused on the theme of “how trees respond to and shape novel environments.” They will leverage the unique research and training resources of a large public botanic garden encompassing urban, managed, restored, and remnant ecosystems. In the Design phase, the researchers in the Center for Tree Science will work with internal and external experts to: 1) Clarify a core overarching question, identify opportunities for synergy in existing projects, and prioritize new cross-disciplinary collaborative research teams and projects; 2) Create a management plan and strategies for data integration and collaboration that allow for interdisciplinary cross-talk, including designing an integrative database that builds on lessons from prior NSF investments; and 3) how to leverage the Arboretum’s existing integrated training and mentorship program in tree science, which prepares students and early career scientists for interdisciplinary, collaborative careers across a range of fields and agencies.

"This Design activity will result in a proposal to create a Biology Integration Institute that will synthesize recent advances in wildlife virology and pursue new insights about the ecology and evolution of the global virome. The pandemic emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is only the latest development in an accelerating trend of dangerous viruses emerging from wildlife. Global travel, urbanization, and increasing human-wildlife contact have all made it easier for these viruses to emerge. In the future, climate change and land use change will reassemble the global virome even further, forcing mammals to cross continents, meet in new ecosystems, and exchange viruses thousands of times more, potentially unleashing even more threats to global health. At least 10,000 of these mammal viruses might have the potential to infect humans, but most of the global virome is still undescribed: only about 1% of mammal viruses have been discovered, and a much smaller fraction in other vertebrates. With so little data, it is difficult to predict which viruses will pose a future threat, or where, when, and how they could emerge. Predicting the next pandemic threat will require new data spanning biological scales, from single genes up to deep evolutionary time, and new statistical methods from the cutting edge of computer science and mathematics. In addition, the project will host summer residencies for trainees  and develope new coursework that combines biology with hands-on computer science labs.

The project assembles a group of virologists, computer scientists, statisticians, and ecologists to explore cutting edge scientific questions about methodology, inference, and impact. The project has three aims: (1) synthesizing existing data about host-virus associations for all vertebrate clades; (2) developing novel approaches to predict host-virus interaction networks, using novel data streams like viral strain diversity characterized from genomes, or receptor data from immunological studies; and (3) developing frameworks for actionable science that will put viral ecology to use for global health science and security. These aims will be accomplished through collaborative workshops. In doing so it will establish a foundation for a full Implementation proposal to develop an Emerging Virus Institute.

"Imagine using microbe-killing materials, structurally similar to insect wings, on hospital and kitchen surfaces. Or generating cheetah-level speeds and power in robots as small as ants. Finding ways to apply natural principles to real-world problems is the goal of bioinspired design. The objectives of this proposal are to develop research, teaching and public engagement activities that will form the basis for creating a future Institute for Bioinspired Design. Specific goals include: 1. Describe and apply mechanical and material properties seen in nature to engineering principles for real-world problems; 2. Develop an educational model aimed at training interdisciplinary teams of scientists; and 3. Actively engage the public in all aspects of this work through public seminars, videos, and the development of K-12 curricula. The field of bioinspired design is highly interdisciplinary, and requires integrating distinct expertise in engineering, materials science, chemistry and biology. However, current training and educational models are often insufficient to prepare the next generation of scientists to work seamlessly across disciplines. This future Institute will serve as a home for interdisciplinary teams to come together quickly and solve societal problems and grand challenges by using best practices of bioinspired design while training the next generation of scientists active in bioinspired design.


Bioinspired design involves using nature as a guide to inform technological innovation. Successfully applying biological principles to innovative design requires integrating across all biological scales: from molecular and cellular processes, to whole organisms, and even ecosystems. The objective of this Design Proposal is to develop research, teaching and outreach activities that will form the basis for a future Implementation Proposal for creating an Institute for Bioinspired Design. The creativity required to identify real-world applications of biological analogs, or to recognize which problems can be successfully tackled with biologically inspired solutions, necessitates meaningful interdisciplinary exchange between those working across different disciplines including biology, chemistry, physics, art, design, engineering and business. For bioinspired design to be successful, we also need a novel educational model to train diverse teams of researchers to work together effectively, and to collaborate on creating original projects from discovery to design.  The planned future institute can address not only improvements and advances in bioinspired design but can serve as a model of integrated biological research that moves beyond biology to integrate with other disciplines facilitating both scientific and societal advances.

"Digital data are being generated at increasingly overwhelming rates both economically and for the environment, with data storage material and energy usages close to reaching the physical limits of what current technologies can provide. For over two decades DNA has been considered with only limited enthusiasm as a potential next generation medium for data storage, despite holding pronounced advantages of high density, stability, and low energy requirements. This is because executing the core operations of a data storage system including write, access, read, and protect using DNA currently requires multiple complex steps carried out in succession. Furthermore, they often require specialized processing and purification in between each operational step. This leads to practical barriers in speed, cost, scalability, and reusability. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that an interdisciplinary collaboration can completely reimagine and reengineer these core operations to be continuous, highly practical, and economically viable through creative integration of knowledge and technologies from disparate disciplines. Specifically, molecular biology techniques from the Biological Sciences will be informed and designed by models and simulations derived from the discipline of Computer Science and Engineering, while these biological components will be physically controlled and interfaced with nanomaterials developed with expertise in Materials Science and Nanoscience. This hybrid information storage system engineered from DNA directly interfaced with novel nanofibrillar substrates, will leverage dynamic processing by biomolecular manipulations, and will unlock direct and rapid readout of information with semiconductor-based nanopore technology. Biomolecular-based computational modeling will inform all aspects of both the design of the system and its operation, from molecular to systems level scales. The interdisciplinary nature of this project will also provide strong opportunities to advance education and diversity in the Science-Technology-Engineering-Math (STEM) workforce through several avenues. This interdisciplinary research provides opportunities for undergraduate researchers to experience directly working with peers and PhD students from very different disciplines on common problems. Undergraduate course modules will be created that bridge synthetic biology, nanoscience, materials science, computer science and engineering that present applied interdisciplinary examples including DNA storage as case studies. Hands-on kits will also be developed to facilitate in-person and virtual activities administered through partnerships with organizations that reach and support underrepresented grade-school students in STEM. 

This project aims to transform DNA storage systems from batch to continuous architectures. Each Aim addresses a unit process (WRITE, ACCESS, READ, PROTECT). WRITE: Rapid, scalable, and cheap DNA synthesis will be engineered by a combination of tree algorithms and enzyme-driven DNA assembly. ACCESS: Continuous and reusable access of information and files will be achieved by immobilization of a DNA database on dendritic colloidal particles with easily accessible high surface areas. This novel scaffold allows a transcription-based file access system previously developed by the team to rapidly extract information in the form of transcribed RNA through simple laminar flow through the DNA database. READ: RNA generated by the ACCESS technology will be directly read by nanopore sequencing, and fundamental experimental and machine learning studies will be engaged to inform the encoding algorithms of DNA databases and to optimize real-time base-calling. PROTECT: The unique physical and thermodynamic attributes of DNA and of these first three hybrid unit processes will be exploited to encrypt and obfuscate information. While fundamental thermodynamic findings, computational models, and physical technologies generated in each aim have strong and specific benefits in mutually informing the other aims, these unit processes will further be integrated together by two ongoing explicit Umbrella Tasks. End-to-end microfluidic devices storing protected data will be engineered by integrating all unit processes, informed by systems-level modeling to identify unit processes that are the bottlenecks for speed, cost, robustness, and longevity. This work will also generate important fundamental knowledge and models that will be generalizable to other types of biomolecular-based information storage systems as well as applicable to problems in each distinct discipline regarding DNA assembly and interaction specificity, nanoparticle engineering, and nucleic acid sequencing.

"Living cells are equipped with highly versatile built-in toolkits of DNA, RNA, and proteins for molecular communication, computing, storage, and sensing/actuation in response to environmental stimuli. Synthetic biology has been successful in developing engineered cells by harnessing the same biological toolkits with enhanced natural functions or new human-defined functions. These engineered cells can potentially serve as a biological frontend layer that naturally interfaces with the environment and acts as biosensors/actuators, molecular computing platforms, and molecular memory to provide revolutionary solutions for many global challenges such as environmental monitoring, and healthcare. In parallel, with decades of technological advances, semiconductor technologies, e.g., Complementary-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits (ICs), are being widely employed as a semiconductor backend layer to achieve various integration, communication, and computation capabilities. This project investigates the development of a hybrid programmable nano-bioelectronic system as a first proof-of-concept demonstration that harnesses both the exquisite synthetic functionalities of engineered bacteria as the ""biological frontend"" and the full functionalities of the ultra-low-power CMOS integrated circuit chips as the ""semiconductor backend."" The target application of such a system includes in-field biological sensor for environment monitoring. The project has potentials for long-term broader impacts on basic science, education, and technology. It brings expertise from synthetic biology, hybrid bioelectronics, integrated circuits/packaging, information theory, and computing. The project directly addresses three research themes of the solicitation: Theme-1, biomolecular memory and computation; Theme 2, interface of biology and semiconductors; Theme-4, hybrid semiconductor-biological microelectronic systems. It seeks to foster collaborations between industry and academia and hence facilitates technology transfer. The team of investigators will train graduate and undergraduate students at Georgia Tech and MIT, including minority and under-represented students. The project will also emphasize K-12 outreach to promote education of local minority high school students. In particular, the research team will recruit high school teacher interns to enhance their curricula and organize lab tours for K-12 students. The research results will be disseminated through high-impact journals, premier conferences, websites, and social media, and will be integrated into multiple related courses at Georgia Tech and MIT.

The project aims to advance the science in multiple fronts and develop an integrated hybrid programmable nano-bioelectronic system. In such a system, a variety of bacteria strains are engineered as sensing, storage, and computation biological frontends to (1) perform wide-spectrum chemical sensing, e.g., heavy metal detections for environmental monitoring, (2) provide in-bacteria DNA-based storage of analog/digital information, (3) execute molecular computation via stochastic computing and encode the signal for the DNA storage, and (4) support ""variable gain"" reprogramming of bacteria sensors by external optical and electrical stimuli. As the integrated semiconductor electronics backend, CMOS IC chips with on-chip pixelated massively paralleled arrays will be developed to provide two-way multi-modal interfaces with the bacteria frontends, i.e., for reading stored sensory information from the bacteria and writing control signals to reprogram the bacteria sensors. The bacteria strains and CMOS ICs will be integrated together in 3D-printed microfluidics structures and packages with separate chambers. The proposed components and systems will be demonstrated through in vitro experiments using the resources at Georgia Tech and MIT.

"The ""Biofilm Resource and Information Database (BRaID)"" project is a collaboration between the Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE) at Montana State University, Bozeman, MT and the Gianforte School of Computing at MSU and the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR), Santa Fe, NM. Biofilms are microbial communities that have important impacts on water quality, food production, energy-making processes, and various aspects of human and animal health. BRaID serves as a community resource, containing both data and the metadata (where or how data was collected, processed, and interpreted).  Some examples of metadata include: a geographical location, such as the Bozeman Water Reclamation Facility; microenvironments such as water chemistry; environmental factors such as changes in temperature, perturbations such as adding corrosion inhibitors; and interventions such as antibiotic treatments. BRaID has utility to a broad range of stakeholders in basic and applied research, as such it is expected to enhance the competitiveness of US industry, basic research, and defense, as well as assist with advancements in human health, environmental health, and energy production. Outreach activities will include (1) dissemination of research outcomes to local community members and industry stakeholders at conferences and legislator engagements; (2) involvement of underrepresented Native American students from high schools and tribal colleges in summer research activities as well as undergraduate researchers at MSU-Bozeman; and (3) educational activities in undergraduate and graduate courses at MSU, as well as summer internship, outreach and training activities at the NCGR.

Awareness of the importance of microbial biofilms - microorganisms growing as aggregates attached to surfaces, interfaces, or each other - has exploded in the past decade. Diverse microbial communities grow as biofilms in such settings as dental plaque, heart valves, natural watercourses, wastewater treatment processes, cooling systems, oil and gas pipelines, and persistent infections. Biofilms can have significant impacts on human health, industrial productivity, and natural resources, spanning natural, engineered, and medical systems. Despite the importance of biofilms, there is no public web portal and database dedicated to storage, analysis, and communication of biofilm-specific data. Part of the reason for this is the sheer breadth of data types used to describe biofilms, including nucleotide sequences, images, video, chemistry (water, surface, and extracellular polymer matrix), remediation history, clinical outcomes, and geospatial data. BRaID will complement existing microbial databases by developing a data representation paradigm that solves the problems posed by the challenge arising from the unique combination of data, and will implement new metrics and algorithms for the formal description and analysis of biofilms data. This project aims to provide the premier resource that offers users the ability to ask complex questions (including those currently impossible to answer), permitting quantitative comparisons among biofilms, supporting remediation efforts, and enabling predictions about outcomes.

"Analyzing single neuron's property is a fundamental task to understand the nervous system and brain working mechanism. Investigating neuron morphology is an effective way to analyze neurons, since it plays a major role in determining neurons' properties. Recently, the ever-increasing neuron databases have greatly facilitated the research of neuron morphology. However, the sheer volume and complexity of these data pose significant challenges for computational analysis, preventing the realization of the full potential of such data. This interdisciplinary project will seek for new avenue to assemble the massive neuron morphologies and provide a unified framework for neuroscientists to explore and analyze different types of neurons. The research is able to tackle many challenges in neuroscience which are hard to solve with previous methods, including fine-grained neuron identification, latent pattern discovery and exploration, etc. The large-scale methods being developed will be particularly beneficial in the future of neuroscience, since more and more neurons are reconstructed and added to the databases. The computational methods and tools developed are very likely to be applicable for solving other bioinformatics problems, especially those dealing with large-scale datasets. The broader impact of this project not only includes educational support for undergraduate researchers and high school students, particularly women and those underrepresented groups, but also contributes to the research of neuroscience and other STEM fields.

The long-term goal of this project is to develop effective computational methods and tools for neuroscientists to interactively explore large-scale neuron databases with ultra-fine-grained accuracy, in real-time. This research has a strong multidisciplinary component that involves a nexus ideas from machine learning, information retrieval, and neuroinformatics. Particularly, novel ideas will be implemented in three inter-related components through the whole framework. The first one addresses the accurate and efficient neuron reconstruction and tracing based on deep learning models. The second addresses the efficient discovery of relevant instances among large-size neuron databases via multi-modal and online binary coding methods. The third part addresses intelligent visualization and interaction schemes for knowledge discovery and mining, equipped with interactive coding that can incorporate domain experts' feedback to enhance the query algorithms for fine-tuned results. Compared with previous methods and systems, this project will open a new avenue to assist neuroscientists analyzing and exploring large-scale neuron databases with high efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. The performance of proposed methods will be validated using public neuro-morphological databases (e.g., NeuroMorpho, BigNeuron) and compared with several benchmarks. The effectiveness of the tools to be developed will be evaluated by neuroscientists on domain-specific hypothesis-driven applications.

This project studies neuron tracing, also known as neuron reconstruction, which aims at building 3D morphological structures of neurons from imaging data, such as laser scanning microscopy images. A major challenge is that laser scanning microscopy images usually have low signal-to-noise ratio and may contain discontinued segments of neurite patterns, making it challenging to perform tracing directly from raw microscopy images. This raises the need of an effective and automatic denoising algorithm to reduce the effect of noise and discontinued segments. In this project, we developed a set of novel deep learning methods for improving the performance of 3D neuron reconstruction from microscopy images. We treat the de-noising problem as an image transformation task in which deep models transform an input image into an output image. The models are trained to determine which voxels in 3D microscopy images belong to neurons. We developed both supervised and self-supervised deep learning methods for denoising images. We used imaging datasets from the BigNeuron project and other biological and natural images to evaluate our methods. Results show that our methods outperform prior methods and lead to improved performance on downstream tasks. Multiple high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students have been trained throughout this project.

"This doctoral dissertation project will examine life histories and ritual using bioarchaeological and biogeochemical analyses of skeletons from archaeological contexts. The research will contribute novel methods and perspectives concerning the role of rituals in ancient societies as well as the integration of osteological and chemical techniques to reconstruct human behavior. This project and the dissemination of its results will increase participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences and encourage future collaborations by involving the public in this project’s excavations, technical workshops, and public lectures. As workshop leaders for the Center for K-12 STEM Education at Tulane University, the investigators will integrate the project’s results into K-12 student curricular resources and workshops to showcase innovative research and broaden the education of groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.

Human skeletal trauma represents direct evidence of conflict, making bioarchaeology, the study of human skeletal remains from archaeological contexts, well positioned to address the variability and significance of ritual violence in the archaeological record. The role of juveniles in such ritual contexts has been relatively understudied. Recently discovered skeletal assemblages suggest that such rituals played an important role in some past societies, yet the motivations for this remain unclear. The investigators hypothesize that individuals from outlying locations in a sociopolitical system were conscripted for ritual events as part of a strategy to maintain control over outlying regions. Continued excavations and biogeochemical analyses of bones and teeth from skeletal assemblagews will be used to test this hypothesis and better understand the ways in which past societies justified incorporation of juveniles in these events.

"State hospitals in the United States have generated considerable discussion among practitioners, government officials, and the general public, from the rise of the asylum in the 19th-century through deinstitutionalization efforts originating in the 1950s. This doctoral dissertation project will examine the biological impact of institutionalization through skeletal analysis of persons who were institutionalized in the past. The research will advance our understanding of institutionalization beyond what can be gleaned from historical accounts alone, and offers a framework for future biological anthropology research to incorporate interdisciplinary approaches. The research may raise mental health awareness and presents an innovative method of linking health disparities in past institutionalized samples to modern-day psychiatric treatment. The project will support graduate training as well as public and descendant community science engagement.

This dissertation research uses skeletal samples from asylums in four states (Colorado, Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio) to understand how incarceration impacts institutionalized women’s health and how it is differentially embodied across ancestry and geographical region. In bioarchaeology, evidence can be seen through varying skeletal pathologies that reflect health disparities indicative of negative conditions that people endured during life. The analysis will focus on skeletal trauma, disease, and fracture analysis which will be statistically examined through hierarchical log-linear analysis and binomial logistic regression. The project highlights the heterogeneous physiological impact of past mental institutionalization in their socio-cultural and historical contexts. It investigates whether skeletal health and epidemiological differences or trends exist across institutionalized geographical samples and attempts to determine if differences in trauma and disease patterns between African-American and Euro-American groups are present in order to gain insight into the impact of racism and segregation within the institutional setting.

"Mycobacterium tuberculosis has a global distribution and infects over a million new people each year. In the pre-contact Americas, tuberculosis (TB) infection was caused by a strain that is found today in seals and sea lions. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how a zoonotic strain of TB adapted to humans as a primary host and spread across the Americas. Throughout the project, undergraduate students at Arizona State University will be trained in genomic lab work and analysis, and the resulting datasets will be used to create undergraduate-level workshops. The research team will demonstrate an equitable international collaboration by fostering mutual understanding and inclusivity among affiliated parties, thereby facilitating long-term, innovative, and productive relationships between institutions.

The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) refers to a group of similar pathogens that cause TB infection in humans and animals. Genomes extracted from archaeological remains show that zoonotic lineages were responsible for human TB infections in the past. Most TB infections in humans today, however, are caused by M. tuberculosis, the human-adapted MTBC lineage. The evolutionary steps of an animal-adapted pathogen becoming a human-adapted pathogen are not entirely understood. The researchers will draw comparisons between modern and ancient MTBC genomes to understand better how zoonotic lineages of TB adapt to humans as primary hosts. Ancient MTBC genomes will be extracted from archaeological skeletons. The research team focuses on a densely populated city and trade epicenter to determine the breadth of genomic diversity of ancient circulating MTBC strains, some of which were likely imported through long-distance trade. As human populations expand and the interface between humans and wildlife narrows, understanding the genomic underpinnings of zoonotic transmission dynamics will inform public health surveillance measures. The results of these comparisons will help frame future epidemiological, evolutionary biology, and infectious disease research.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Arizona State University,AZ,31398,1945812,acstone@asu.edu,Anne,Stone,1,04/06/2020,04/01/2020,08/31/2021,Doctoral Dissertation Research: The Zoonotic Origins of Tuberculosis Infection in the Pre-contact Americas,,"The goal of this project was to detect and characterize tuberculosis (TB) infections in Tlatelolco, a densely populated city and marketplace in pre-conquest Mesoamerica. TB is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), a genetically similar group of pathogens. The MTBC includes M. tuberculosis, the primary cause of TB in humans, and animal-associated trains, such as M. bovis found in cows and M. pinnipedii found in seals and sea lions. TB was only recently surpassed by SARS-CoV-2 as the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. Although TB incidence has been declining, disrupted medical supply chains, overcrowded clinics and hospitals in at-risk areas, and co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 may cause cases to rise again. Given that TB is still a global public health threat today, we wanted to understand the long-term trajectory of the pathogen and how it impacted urban communities hundreds of years ago. 

There is an abundance of skeletal evidence that TB infected people in the Americas prior to European conquest. TB is primarily a pulmonary infection, but the bacteria can escape the lungs and target the skeletal system; the resulting damage to bones is identifiable in skeletons hundreds to thousands of years old. Since today TB infections in the Americas are generally caused by a European strain of M. tuberculosis, what strain of MTBC was causing TB in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans has been an enduring question. Research has shown that 1,000-year-old skeletons from Peru were infected with M. pinnipedii, the member of the MTBC associated with seals and sea lions. This suggests that humans contracted TB from seals and sea lions on the coasts of South America, where the archaeological records shows humans have been hunting, processing, and consuming them for millennia. 

For this project, we extracted DNA from over 60 skeletal elements with varying evidence of TB infection. Since DNA extraction from bone is destructive, first we wanted to see if there were any relationships among the age-at-death of the skeleton, the type of TB bone lesion, and ability to recover MTBC DNA so that in the future researchers may have a higher successful recovery rate and avoid unnecessary bone destruction. We found that the lumbar vertebrae of younger individuals with lytic lesions were the most likely to yield MTBC DNA. Additionally, we found that it is possible to sample the bone in a non-pathological area near a pathological lesion and recover MTBC DNA, minimizing damage to areas of the skeleton that are important for paleopathological and osteological analysis. 

We also expanded our understanding of the genetic diversity of MTBC in a pre-conquest city through the generation of an additional 11 whole and partial MTBC genomes. All 11 genomes are related to M. pinnipedii, but they are evolutionarily ""older"" than MTBC genomes from South America. Additionally, the MTBC strains at Tlatelolco are more genetically distinct from each other than MTBC strains recovered across multiple sites in Peru and Chile. This means that MTBC had been circulating in Mesoamerica for a long time and likely reflects the influx of people from around the Basin of Mexico and beyond into the Tlatelolco marketplace, possibly the largest in the Americas at the time. Further analyses will help us understand why such seemingly successful strains of MTBC were entirely replaced in human populations after the arrival of European strains. 

Our data provide new insights into the distribution and strain diversity of the MTBC in the Americas, but the unexpected relationship between South American and North American MTBC strains has led to more questions about the origin, zoonotic potential, and transmission pathways of pre-conquest MTBC. MTBC genomes from older human and non-human skeletons across the Americas will be key for understanding whether recurrent waves of zoonotic introduction and strain replacement in South America, an independent North American origin of MTBC in the Americas, or a mixture of both is the most likely scenario. Revealing trends and genetic determinants of the introduction, success, and replacement of zoonotic infections in humans across thousands of years provides a timely perspective on the potential of zoonoses. 

The broader impacts of this work included the training of the Co-PI in laboratory methods and computational analyses. Additionally, since ancient DNA extracts contain DNA from many organisms, the data we generated for this project is being used for additional projects investigating human genetic ancestry and oral health, all led by or in collaboration with colleagues at the Laboratorio Internacional de Investigaci&oacute;n sobre el Genoma Humano in Quer&eacute;taro, Mexico. Not only have we exemplified responsible ancient DNA research by performing destructive sampling once to produce data for several research projects, but also we have established an equitable collaboration with Mexican researchers that includes control of the research agenda, full participation of Mexican scientists and students, and freely shared data.

"Humans are distinguished by their ability to walk upright on two legs and their capacity for endurance running. This behavior is explained in part by the endurance capabilities of human skeletal muscle, which, in comparison to chimpanzees, are better suited for holding bodies upright and being active for prolonged periods without fatiguing. However, it is unknown how this property of human skeletal muscle evolved due to its absence from the fossil record and a limited understanding of muscle fiber development at the genetic level. This doctoral dissertation project will identify the genetic switches controlling muscle fiber development using a suite of cutting-edge molecular methods. In doing so, this research will add novel information about the complex genetic landscape underlying muscle fiber development and illuminate the evolutionary history of a unique human trait that may have played a key role in bipedal evolution. This project will support graduate training in advanced molecular methods and bioinformatics. Additionally, the researcher will share their findings with the public by hosting a “science run” outreach event. Finally, data generated from this research will help characterize muscle biology at the genetic level and therefore has the potential to help target more efficient treatments for a range of neuromuscular diseases.

Understanding when, why and how the transition to bipedalism occurred over the course of human evolution is a fundamental question in biological anthropology. As a species, humans are characterized by a suite of well-described anatomical adaptations that support efficient, long-distance bipedal locomotion. While many of these traits are observable in the fossil record (e.g., bone morphology), others (e.g., properties of skeletal muscle) are more difficult to detect. The high proportion of fatigue-resistant slow-twitch muscle fibers in human hind limb muscles optimizes them to perform tonic, endurance-based activities, and suggests that this trait helps enable long-distance bipedal locomotion. Yet, the genetic mechanisms controlling this trait are not well understood. To address this gap in knowledge, this project will identify the genetic mechanisms underlying muscle fiber development and reconstruct the evolutionary history of these mechanisms across primates. The central hypothesis of this research is that natural selection has selected for human-specific variation in regions of the genome that influence muscle fiber type, increasing the amount of slow-twitch fibers in human hind limb skeletal muscles and the efficiency of bipedal locomotion. To test this hypothesis, the researcher will first use a tailored ATACseq approach to identify those parts of the genome that are active in mammalian muscle tissues and associated with muscle fiber type. Next, they will test the function of a subset of these regions with human-specific variation. In doing so, this project will enrich anthropological understandings of human evolution by identifying regions of the human genome that have shaped the biology of a trait highly relevant to bipedalism.

"In biocultural research, anthropologists are interested in the complex interactions between biology and culture that occur throughout the human lifecourse. One important part of the lifecourse is the time immediately following the birth of a child, when mothers experience physiological changes, may be vulnerable to various stressors, and potentially receive help from other individuals. This doctoral dissertation research examines the relationships between maternal postpartum depression, culturally relevant social support, and maternal levels of the hormone oxytocin, to better understand the postpartum period from a biocultural perspective. The project will advance fundamental knowledge about maternal dynamics and the biocultural nature of our species. The research may also have broader public health impact by informing culturally appropriate interventions for improving postpartum maternal health. In addition, the project will support graduate training, international research collaborations, and community science outreach. 

A cooperative breeding model has been used to describe patterns of infant care in humans. Mothers especially benefit from help during the immediate postpartum when the stress of caring for an altricial infant co-occurs with physical recovery from pregnancy. This project focuses on maternal characteristics in the immediate postpartum, thereby extending beyond previous work that focused largely on reproductive fitness and infant outcomes. Following a cohort of women who share cultural expectations regarding postpartum support, this study will examine whether greater discordance between received and expected social support in the postpartum is related to maternal depressive symptoms, and whether oxytocin and social support levels are related. The project will characterize local cultural expectations of social support via interviews with women. A group of 150 pregnant women will be interviewed during their third trimester, and again approximately 40 days postpartum to determine congruence between received support (reported and directly observed) and cultural expectations of social support, depressive symptoms, and urine oxytocin levels.

"Growth is a central aspect of a species’ biology, and modern humans are fundamentally different in the timing, duration, and pace of our growth compared to other primates. Understanding when and why the modern human growth pattern evolved is key to understanding part of what makes modern humans unique among primates. This doctoral dissertation project examines the links between variation in primate growth rates and hormonal underpinnings via the pituitary gland and a bony structure, the sella turcica. In doing so, it will develop a novel, non-destructive method for estimating individual growth rates and will investigate the effects of ecology and environment on living primates’ growth rates. The insights into pituitary and sella turcica growth and evolution provided by these data also have the potential to inform diagnoses of abnormal pituitary conditions and the etiology of growth deficiencies or diseases related to pituitary hormones. This project will support graduate training and undergraduate research experiences at Arizona State University (ASU), expanding educational opportunities and providing undergraduates with advanced visualization and 3D processing skills that can be applied to fields as varied as engineering and medicine. In addition, the researcher will communicate project findings through science education outreach activities for student and public audiences. 

Given the importance of growth, the ultimate causes (or selective pressures) that shape growth rates have long been the subject of research, but the proximate mechanisms that underpin variation in growth rates are less well studied. At the proximate level, body growth is the direct result of hormones produced by endocrine glands such as the pituitary. This project builds upon the relationship between the size of the pituitary, which is positively correlated with growth rate across mammalian taxa, and the sella turcica, the bony structure within which the pituitary gland is housed, to first test whether the size of the nonhuman primate sella turcica reflects body growth rate. This goal will be achieved by pairing 3D cranial morphology data with growth data from well-studied primate populations. Second, this research will assess how aspects of ecology and demography (i.e., ultimate causes such as resource availability, food quality, mortality) relate to living primates’ body growth rates both within the study populations and across a comparative sample of 51 species. It will then assess whether these ecological variables also explain variations in relative sella turcica size. Together, the complementary components of this project will contribute to a better understanding of primate growth.

It found that the environmental conditions experienced early in life are linked to the pace of growth (as well as achieved body size) in the Cayo Santiago macaque population. It also found that seasonal variation in vegetation is the strongest predictor of growth rate across primate species. This project further explored links between the ultimate drivers of variation in primate growth rate and their proximate (i.e., hormonal) underpinnings via a hard-tissue structure, the sella turcica. Analyses of sella turcica size across a sample of 51 primate species revealed that the relative size of the sella turcica is strongly positively correlated with postnatal growth rate, which suggests that sella turcica size may be useful for estimating somatic growth rate in species represented by cranial material. Together, the complementary components of this project contribute to a better understanding of the ultimate and proximate underpinnings of primate growth.

Intellectual merit

Growth is the background metronome against which other developmental events are framed, and the pattern and pace of growth are central aspects of a species? biology. Compared to other primates, modern humans are fundamentally different in the timing, duration, and pace of our growth. Understanding when and why the modern human growth pattern evolved is an active area of research within paleoanthropology. The results of this project suggest that non-destructive measurements of sella turcica size may be useful for estimating growth rate in fossil hominins. This research also provided insights into the effect of specific ecological conditions on growth rates in extant primates, which can help inform our understanding of the conditions that might have selected for modern humans? protracted growth and development.

Broader impacts

Although this project was inspired by paleoanthropological questions, it also has transdisciplinary implications for human health and veterinary care. The insights into pituitary and sella turcica growth and evolution provided by these data have the potential to inform diagnoses of abnormal pituitary conditions and the etiology of growth deficiencies or diseases related to pituitary hormones. The new CT data generated by this project will be made publicly available online and are broadly applicable to research that requires primate cranial data. The novel, non-destructive methods developed here can also be applied to studies of life history in non-hominin primates and non-primate fossil mammals. This project provided graduate training to the co-PI and helped her to refine her teaching, research, and mentoring skills. Undergraduate students from Arizona State University (ASU), a diverse public university, were trained to assist the co-PI in data collection. This expanded educational opportunities and provided these undergraduates with advanced visualization and processing skills that can be applied to fields as varied as engineering and medicine. The skills and insights into human and primate evolution that this project provided ultimately enriched the knowledge and perspective that the co-PI can transmit to the local and wider community through her involvement in public outreach programs.

"Fundamental research in human biology has provided insight into the complexity of breastfeeding as a unique form of maternal investment that is responsive to offspring cues, sensitive to environmental inputs, and capable of influencing short- and long-term offspring outcomes. While much of this research has focused on implications for infant physiology, comparatively little is known about the biological determinants and impacts of breastfeeding practices among mothers. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the maternal physiological dynamics of breastfeeding, advancing knowledge about the ways in which immune function, physiological status, and behavior are interrelated in humans. The research may also inform public health research and practice about breastfeeding behaviors. The project will facilitate graduate and undergraduate training and mentoring, and research outcomes will be shared with the participant community as well as a broader research and public audience. 

Few studies have directly examined the link between maternal immune function, maternal physiological status, and breastfeeding behavior in humans during the perinatal period. This study will longitudinally measure breastfeeding behavior, immunological biomarkers, and perceived physical and mental well-being among a heterogenous sample of pregnant and postpartum women in the United States, a population exhibiting unprecedented variation in breastfeeding behavior. The resulting data will be used to test two overarching hypotheses: (1) heightened inflammatory activation in late pregnancy will predict increased breastfeeding difficulties and impaired maternal physiological status, and (2) continuation of skin-to-skin breastfeeding across the early postpartum period will correspond to better regulated immune “bounce-back” and enhanced maternal physiological status. Findings generated by this study have the potential to inform current public health strategies to (1) identify mothers who may experience heightened barriers to breastfeeding success, (2) provide support for women to continue breastfeeding, and (3) support mental and physical maternal well-being during the transition from pregnancy to the postpartum period.

From an evolutionary perspective, replacement or heavy supplementation of at-the-nipple breastfeeding should be linked to dysregulated maternal immune recalibration, increased risk of sickness behavior (e.g., depression) and more symptoms of physical illness, due to evolutionary mismatch. On the other hand, mothers who sustain exclusive at-the-nipple breastfeeding for extended periods may experience diminishing returns on immune and health benefits due to increasing maternal-offspring conflict. In this context, moderating the degree of skin-to-skin breastfeeding may, to some degree and in a time-dependent manner, help mothers optimize their own immune status and health. We tested these predictions by collecting data on infant feeding behavior, biomarkers of inflammation, depressive symptoms, and self-reported physical health from a sample of postpartum mothers in the United States. We found that, in the early postpartum period, both at-the-nipple breastfeeding and pumping are associated with fewer symptoms of depression compared to other infant feeding methods. In the later postpartum period, however, pumping was associated with more symptoms of depression compared to breastfeeding. We found no association between at-the-nipple breastfeeding and physical symptoms, but observed a consistent positive relationship between pumping and symptoms of physical illness (especially among mothers in later postpartum period). This pattern was the opposite of what we predicted, indicating that the protective effect of at-the-nipple breastfeeding remains stable over time while the benefits of pumping are limited to the first several months after delivery. In addition, both at-the-nipple breastfeeding and pumping corresponded with attenuated morning peak in inflammatory markers - even in the relative absence of pathogen exposure. Taken together, these patterns provide evidence that both at-the-nipple breastfeeding and pumping downregulate inflammatory processes, especially in the early postpartum period. In sum, these findings suggest that mothers who exhibit greater reliance on at-the-nipple breastfeeding (and, in certain contexts, pumping/expressing breastmilk) may enjoy certain health benefits. It is also possible that the causal pathway goes in the other direction - lower inflammatory activation and fewer depressive and physical symptoms may promote greater breastmilk production. Future research is needed to further parse out these pathways.

"The classification of species based on skeletal morphology (shape) often has been focused on characteristics of the cranium (skull). However, research has also begun to address the taxonomic signal of other parts of the skeleton. This doctoral dissertation project will use state-of-the art 3D scanning technology to provide a systematic taxonomic assessment of the cranium and numerous post-cranial skeletal elements among closely related species of macaques. Macaques are an ideal model system because they are geographically widespread, there are numerous species, and they occupy a wide range of dietary and climatic niches. The results will provide novel insights into which aspects of skeletal morphology best reflect the genetic relationships of macaques, as well as which bones best reflect dietary, locomotor, and environmental differences among species. Findings in extant primates also will inform the study of fossil species where genetic information is typically not available. The research advances the career of a female scientist, and results will be disseminated to K-12 students from historically underrepresented groups. In addition, 3D models will be used to educate students about how animals with different morphologies adapt to their environments. Public outreach also will be achieved through blog posts, workshops, and seminar presentations.

This project seeks to determine if morphological data inferred from the skeleton tracks genetic distances, and therefore, can be a useful tool for species assessment. Skeletons of the relatively specious and geographically widespread macaque will be used to test the hypotheses that (1) taxonomy can be accurately predicted based on morphological patterns, and (2) post-cranial elements may reflect taxonomy at the same level, or better than, the skull. Data will consist of 3D morphometric analyses of eight macaque species and three non-macaque out-groups, each chosen for their diverse genetic, geographic and behavioral relatedness. In cases where bones do not follow the pattern expected by genetics, additional statistical analyses will be performed to test the extent to which skeletal morphology is driven by climatic, dietary or locomotor differences between species. The outcomes of this research will include a large dataset of 3D bone scans from a single primate genus, which will be publicly shared. Moreover, the results will provide an important bridge between the analysis of living primate species and extinct fossil species for which only fragmentary skeletal morphology is known.

"The growth and development of the human skeleton is affected by the way it is used across the life course.  In order to understand how human skeletal development evolved, it is useful to study skeletal development in other closely related primates. The goal of this doctoral dissertation project is to investigate how changes in locomotion across the chimpanzee life course are reflected in the skeleton. Chimpanzees change from moving mostly in the trees when they are young to moving more on the ground as they age, providing an opportunity to examine how chimpanzee trabecular (spongy) and cortical (compact) bone are modified as locomotion changes across the life course. The research will contribute to our understanding of bone biology, specifically the sensitivity of the skeleton to changes in movement throughout life, which can be used to better reconstruct the locomotion of extinct fossil apes and humans, particularly the evolution of terrestriality. This research will be used in K-12 science outreach and exhibited at natural history museums. CT scans and 3D prints of Pan troglodytes and fossil hominoids (apes) will also be part of an international exhibit focused on ape evolution and conservation. All CT scans generated from this project will be shared with the museums where the data were collected, furthering scientific access and inquiry. 

Bones are a crucial source of data from the fossil record because they undergo modification in response to the mechanical loads placed upon them during movement (e.g. walking, running, climbing). However, most studies to date focus on either trabecular or cortical bone and not the two together in one study. Chimpanzees modify how they move through their life, shifting from more arboreal to more terrestrial substrates from infancy to adulthood. Thus, if the skeleton is responding to these changes, the investigators hypothesize that these transitions will be detectable in trabecular and cortical bone. This study will also address whether both bone types respond to locomotor changes during development, and will apply these findings to other species, extant and fossil, to help in recovering patterns of movement and substrate usage. These questions will be addressed using microCT scans of trabecular bone in the fore- and hindlimb as well as pQCT scans of cortical bone in the shaft of the femur, tibia, humerus, and radius. The prediction is that trabecular and cortical bone at each life history stage will reflect the locomotor behaviors used at that time. By further studying the relationship between ontogenetic changes in behavior and cortical and trabecular bone structure, novel anatomical proxies sensitive to loading patterns may be identified and used to reconstruct the locomotor repertoires of fossil apes and humans.

"This doctoral dissertation project will examine the quantity and path of nerves that run through the jaws and teeth of mammals to establish if the size of these nerves is related to diet. The investigator will focus on humans and non-human primates, to determine if different diets correspond to the concentration of soft tissues (like nerves, arteries, and veins) in specific sections of the mouth and teeth. The research will advance knowledge about the relationships between soft tissues, bony tissues, jaw function, and diet, and may also inform our understanding of craniomandibular plasticity in modern humans. The project will support undergraduate and graduate STEM training, create an open, online database of scan data, and be used in a variety of science outreach projects and blog posts aimed at K-12 and general public audiences. 

Primates use sensory mechanisms to choose foods based on color, taste, size, and texture. These sensory mechanisms are controlled by nerves in the skin, eyes, mouth, teeth, and other structures that allow a primate to determine if a food is safe for eating. The primary nerves that supply sensation to the mouth are branches of the trigeminal nerve that pass through the maxilla and mandible. Previous research indicates that larger nerves relay more sensory information at faster speeds, suggesting that it is important to know the size of nerves to understand their functions. It has also been established that primate diets are intimately tied to tooth shape and chewing function, suggesting that the properties of teeth and their accompanying nerves are selected for simultaneously in relation to how they sense the properties (i.e., toughness, stiffness) of foods. The proposed work will use microCT scanning and iodine staining methods to examine the relationship between tooth shape and the nerves of teeth, with a focus on how these structures vary in relation to primate diets. Teeth of primates that are adapted to leaf- or insect-eating are predicted to need more nerves in the back of the mouth (under the molars), while fruit-eating primates are expected to have more nerves at the front of the mouth. This hypothesis is supported by data showing that individuals eating tougher diets manipulate food objects within their mouth more than individuals that consume softer food objects. This manipulation is partly due to how primates use nerves to assess material properties of an object to ensure that the individual does not damage their teeth during chewing.

These sensory mechanisms are controlled by nerves in the skin, eyes, mouth, and teeth that allow a primate to determine if a food is safe for eating. A branch of the trigeminal nerve ? the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) ? is responsible for detecting the textures of food as you chew, and especially helps to protect your teeth from damage. Previous research shows that larger nerves relay more sensory information at faster speeds, indicating that it is important to know the size of nerves to understand their functions. It has also been established that the diet of a primate is related to tooth form and chewing, suggesting that the size and shape of teeth and their accompanying nerves may be closely related. This study used microCT scans (133 individuals, 40 primate species, 5 non-primate mammals) and iodine staining methods to examine the relationship between tooth shape and nerves, with a focus on how these structures are different in primates that eat different foods. This research is the first to examine the variation we see in the nerves that help control chewing across a wide range of primates and to explore the evolutionary relationships between groups, helping us to better understand dietary differences. 

 This research focused on three major questions that evaluate the relationships between the hard and soft tissue components in the oral cavity that are related to chewing and diet. First, we examined relationships between size and shape of the tooth crown, the tooth root surface area, and size of the IAN. Second, we examined the relationship between the IAN and the mandibular canal (through which the IAN is transmitted inside the lower jaw). Third, we examined the relationship between the IAN and primate diets. Results indicate that, while the size of the root and crown of each tooth are closely related to each other, there is no relationship between the shape of the crown and root size, nor were there relationships between IAN size and either crown or root properties. In other words, nervous tissue volume is not related to the size and shape of the teeth. Second, this work found that in most primate species (74.9%) there is no defined mandibular canal running through the mandible. Further, when a canal can be identified, the IAN rarely accounts for more than 60% of the total canal space. Finally, we found that there is no relationship between the size of the IAN and primate diets. 

 While the nervous and chewing systems of primates have been studied extensively, no research has ever addressed the relationships described here. This work has advanced the field of anthropology by showing that the IAN is closely related to the overall size of the lower jaw and is not under the same selective dietary pressures that have been found for the teeth. Additionally, this research strongly suggests that bony canals cannot be used to estimate the size and shape of all soft tissues that are housed within them.

 The broader impacts of this research are varied. First, this research trained three undergraduate researchers in digital anatomical methods, the care and maintenance of a soft tissue collection, and provided training in scientific analysis and writing. Second, all microCT scans generated in this research will be made publicly available on morphosource.org (an open-source database) to promote open access communication and future innovation in the scientific community. Finally, this study can help to improve society by adding a large volume of data on the nerves of the chewing system, which is relevant for better understanding the function of the chewing system and potentially has applications in dentistry.

"This dissertation explores how human biological variation influenced the risk of death and survival in a major influenza pandemic. The researchers examine human skeletal remains of people who died during an influenza pandemic to understand how frailty (defined as the increased likelihood of disease and death) and resilience impacted the risk of mortality. In addition to increasing scientific knowledge of biological vulnerability, this project will help researchers understand how social norms create  inequalities that directly impact health and mortality. The researchers will collect public health data on underrepresented groups, creating valuable information on how influenza incidence and severity may vary in marginalized populations. This project will therefore contribute to the goals of Healthy People 2020, a government initiative to improve the health of all Americans. This project will identify risk factors that increased a person’s risk of dying in a past influenza pandemic, helping scientists predict how a future influenza outbreak may affect modern populations. This research will provide a female first-generation college student with training in a STEM field, laboratory methods, and statistics, as well as additional opportunities for her to collaborate with scholars in other fields.

It seems obvious that a person who is frail should always be more likely to die than someone who is healthy and resilient. However, during the Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918, young adults between the ages of 20-40 were among the most likely to die. There are many theories as to why seemingly healthy young adults died in record numbers during this pandemic, however no one has questioned whether the young people were actually healthy. Was there some underlying frailty in these individuals or was the pandemic truly killing resilient people? This project will explore the factors that influenced mortality and survival in the 1918 pandemic by answering the following questions: 1) Were frail individuals more likely to die during the Spanish Influenza pandemic? 2) Were more resilient individuals more likely to survive the Spanish Influenza pandemic? 3) Do demographic factors such as age, sex, and race influence frailty and resilience? Human skeletal remains from the Hamann-Todd collection, an assemblage of individuals who died in Cleveland, Ohio, during the 1918 pandemic will be examined for skeletal markers of frailty and resilience. These data will be analyzed using a type of statistical analyses called hazards analysis that shows how the risk of death changes over time in response to certain circumstances. The results will show how the risk of death varied during the pandemic in individuals who were frail versus those who were resilient.

"The gut microbiome is the community of bacteria that resides in the gastrointestinal tract, and past research has demonstrated that this community is physiologically important to its host. However, researchers do not yet fully understand why the gut microbiome varies so much from individual to individual. This doctoral dissertation project will examine how social behaviors such as physical proximity and infant care-giving affect gut microbiome transmission among adult and infant individuals in a wild primate population. This research will therefore advance fundamental knowledge about microbiome variation in a non-human primate and may also inform microbiome research in humans. The project will facilitate the completion of a doctoral degree by a woman in science, contribute to the training of multiple undergraduate students in scientific laboratory and field methods, and engage young women and other underrepresented groups in STEM through public outreach. In addition, the work will provide wildlife education to local school children, ecotourists, tour guides, and field assistants near the research site through training and public outreach, which will increase local human resource capacity and aid in the conservation of a critically endangered primate species. 

A mounting body of evidence suggests that the gut microbiome is an important phenotypic trait in understanding human biological variation and well-being. However, we still lack a necessary understanding of the factors that shape phenotypic and developmental plasticity in this trait. A primary factor affecting variation in the gut microbiome that remains unclear is the longitudinal effect of social environment on the composition of the gut microbiome. Further, we do not understand how socially-mediated transmission affects the assembly of the gut microbiome during development, which is a critical window thought to have long-reaching effects later in life. The primate model system allows examination of how the gut microbiome changes with shifting social dynamics because adult female social bonds are known to fluctuate following infant births and infants receive variable amounts of social contact via allomaternal care (caretaking behaviors by individuals other than the mother). Using a combination of detailed behavioral data and microbial DNA sequencing in longitudinally collected fecal samples, this research will determine the effect size of social transmission of gut microbes among socially interacting adult females and between allomothers and infants.

"Antimicrobial resistance, now considered a pressing public health concern, has propagated into the microbial communities of urban and natural environments around the world. Only recently has antimicrobial resistance been identified as an environmental contaminant and ecological concern; its impacts on wildlife and their environments remain relatively unknown. This doctoral dissertation project will characterize and quantify antimicrobial resistance in a primate species and its habitats, across different environmental conditions. Beyond contextualizing antimicrobial resistance in an endangered species and vulnerable landscape, this research will highlight the potential for transmission of resistant bacteria between hosts, including humans, and their environments. With far-reaching value for nonhuman primate conservation and husbandry, the results of this study will be shared with the scientific community (via collaborations, presentations, attendance of domestic and international conferences, and publications) and with the public (via science education and outreach).

Although revolutionary for modern society, the ubiquitous use of antibiotics has resulted in the rapid development of antimicrobial resistance genes that persist in bacterial genomes, can be transferred to other microbes, and may be proliferating environmental reservoirs of resistance. Animals can acquire resistant bacteria either through exposure to direct antibiotic administration (e.g., through veterinary care) or to environments contaminated with antibiotics or resistance bacteria. Once incorporated into host-associated communities, known as microbiomes, resistant bacteria disrupt the symbiotic roles of commensal microbes and diminish the host’s immune function. Current understanding about the transmission and impacts of resistance derives primarily from studies of humans and clinically prominent animal models (i.e., laboratory rodents). To better understand and combat the ubiquitous ‘resistance crisis’ on a more comprehensive scale, a broader, ecological framework is necessary. The Co-PI’s dissertation research is focused on assessing antimicrobial resistance as a novel facet of anthropogenic disturbance that differentially impacts lemurs living along a gradient of disturbance (i.e., ranging from minimally to greatly disturbed natural habitats and captive settings). Using next-generation sequencing techniques, this project has three specific aims: to determine the abundance of antimicrobial resistance in (1) the gut microbiome of lemurs, (2) representative environmental microbiomes (from soil and water) across the lemurs’ habitats, and (3) the gut microbiome of lemurs directly experiencing acute and cumulative antibiotic exposure. By studying varying disturbances in lemurs and their environments, we will determine specific sources of antimicrobial resistance and highlight the resistance crisis as an ecological and conservation concern with the potential to impact wildlife worldwide.

The consequences of antibiotic resistance, however, have largely been studied from the perspective of preserving human health, with relatively little investigation into the risk to wildlife and natural ecosystems. In this project, we characterized antibiotic resistance in multiple populations of wild and captive ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) that were exposed to varying types and degrees of anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., antibiotic treatment, habitat degradation, direct contact with humans). Additionally, we explored whether or not antibiotic resistance genes were shared between lemurs and the soils in their environments. We used a combination of high-throughput, next-generation sequencing techniques, paired with microbial source-tracking software to identify antibiotic resistance genes and their potential bidirectional transmission pathways between lemurs and the environment. This research has important implications for the health and management of animals under human care, as well as for the conservation of wildlife and their environments.

 

Notably, we found that lemurs experiencing greater anthropogenic disturbance harbored greater proportions of antibiotic resistance genes, including those that are clinically relevant to human health. In wild lemurs, agricultural activities and human presence were drivers of resistance gene prevalence, whereas in captive lemurs, antibiotic treatment and direct human contact determined resistance gene enrichment. In lemurs receiving antibiotic treatment, resistance genes appeared to increase during and persist after treatment, a pattern that was diminished if the lemur received a fecal microbiota transplant following antibiotic treatment. In one population of captive lemurs, antibiotic resistance genes were universally present, including in animals that had never received antibiotic treatment, indicating social or environmental acquisition of clinically relevant resistance genes. We further found that the types of resistance genes present in different lemur populations reflected specific antibiotic uses by nearby human populations. In wild lemur populations that had experienced greater exposure to anthropogenic disturbance, resistance genes were shared between lemurs and their environments, suggesting that resistance genes can be transmitted between humans, wildlife, and the environment.

 

Together, these results indicate that human activity underlies the propagation of antibiotic resistance in natural ecosystems and that captive and wild animals can be reservoirs of clinically relevant resistance genes. Importantly, by identifying factors that govern antibiotic resistance in different environments, this research has highlighted actionable steps to minimize resistance propagation, namely by conserving natural, undisturbed ecosystems and preventing human-wildlife contact. It has also provided preliminary insight into the potential benefits of microbial therapies, such as fecal microbiota transplants, in mitigating the development and spread of antibiotic resistance in animals treated with or exposed to antibiotics. In addition to providing an ecological framework for concepts that have largely been studied within clinical settings, this research expands our understanding of the ?resistance crisis? and begins to address the recent and urgent calls to better incorporate microbial ecology into animal care and conservation.

 

Beyond the dissemination of this research at academic conferences and in peer-reviewed publications, we presented these results in multiple venues, including to K-12 and undergraduate students as well as to animal care professionals and veterinarians. Throughout the project, multiple students were trained in laboratory and/or field protocols, including two Duke University undergraduate students who completed their honors research and graduated with distinction, as well as two Malagasy field assistants. This research sparked numerous professional development opportunities, including a collaboration between Dr. Bornbusch and the Smithsonian?s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, culminating in Dr. Bornbusch co-leading a Smithsonian One Health internship for high school, undergraduate, and masters students.

"Modern humans expanded into nearly every region of the world, adapting both culturally and biologically to a range of natural environments. Past research in human skeletal biology has shown that the human limb skeleton shifts toward a shorter, more robust morphology in cold-adapted populations and a taller, less robust morphology in heat-adapted populations. This doctoral dissertation project will examine how evolutionary processes have shaped this diversity in the human limb skeleton through changes in growth and development (ontogeny). The project will directly address the relationship between different evolutionary forces and changes in growth trajectories, advancing knowledge about biological mechanisms underpinning human morphological adaptations and plasticity. Reconstructed 3D surface renderings from computed tomography (CT) scans and other data generated from this project will be shared freely to facilitate further research and the development of online teaching materials. In addition, the project will promote undergraduate mentoring and training, as well as national and international collaborations through conferences, seminars and workshops with partner institutions.

Past studies have shown that adaptation by natural selection to climatic conditions, neutral (non-selective) evolution, and non-heritable change in response to climatic conditions (phenotypic plasticity) may all play important roles in shaping the diverse morphological patterns observed in the human limb skeleton. In addition, studies on juvenile skeletons have shown that these morphological patterns are evident at young ages. When and how these different evolutionary forces influence limb shape and size during growth remain unclear. This project uses a global sample of osteometric measurements taken from bone specimens of archaeological populations and 3D modules reconstructed from CT scans of contemporary population to tease apart these different evolutionary forces. The investigator will use a range of statistical methods and models to address whether: 1) selection on body size during growth will have different effects on limb morphology, 2) neutral evolutionary forces can account for some of the divergence in growth trajectories in addition to climatic adaptation, and 3) selection acts primarily on adults, juvenile individuals, or both.

"Reconstructing the movements and interactions of humans in the past informs our broader understanding of the biological and cultural processes that have shaped human populations through time. In this doctoral dissertation project, the investigator will compare two methods used to reconstruct human population dynamics in the past based on skeletal data. Understanding the relative merits of these biological methods will support more complex analyses that rely on both biological and cultural data from past populations. The interdisciplinary project draws upon theory and methods from evolutionary anthropology, genetics, statistics, and bioarchaeology. Through free and low-cost courses and outreach talks, a broad audience, including members of descendant communities, interested members of the public, and underserved students in STEM fields, will engage in discussions about the complexities of human population dynamics and the relevance of these processes in the modern world. 

The project will investigate two methods for identifying signatures of gene flow from osteological data, in order to address larger questions about the social, cultural and biological aspects of population interactions in the past. The two methods compared in this study determine the presence of gene flow by looking at two of its potential effects: a greater degree of similarity in morphology between groups (the biological distance model), and an increase in group morphological variation (the quantitative genetic model). The study will address three primary research questions: Does the inference of gene flow differ between studies using two different models to investigate the same skeletal remains? Are important nuances about group interactions captured using one biological method that are not inferable from the other, or do both methods need to be used together to achieve better resolution about gene flow? And finally, how does each method compare to hypotheses of migration established from material culture? These questions will be addressed by comparing the results of two analyses in two different archaeological contexts within a region with a well-researched archaeological record. The first context has evidence from material culture that is indicative of past migration (and possible gene flow) between groups, and the second has material culture evidence indicating cultural separation and likely no gene flow. Through these tests, the investigators will evaluate the ability of individual models to estimate gene flow in contexts with no written records.

"In early life, organisms receive cues about their environment from their mother, specifically her hormones. But how offspring respond to these signals is not fully understood. This doctoral dissertation project will examine how the early-life environment and maternal “stress” hormones impact development in a long-lived, wild primate. In humans, high maternal stress can result in low offspring birth weight, which in turn predicts poor physiological status later in life. By studying a wild primate, this research will help identify why these connections exist and could inform interventions designed to help prevent negative outcomes. Additionally, this project will contribute to conservation and education at the research site and surrounding areas, through frequent presentations to local community members, tourists, and park management officials. The co-PI will also continue to mentor undergraduate women in the laboratory throughout her dissertation.

When faced with adversity, mammalian mothers have fewer resources to invest in their offspring. These mothers also experience higher levels of “stress” hormones. These hormones, through the placenta and breastmilk, can reach the offspring and indicate the mother’s divestment, potentially leading to adjusted offspring development in response to these signals. There are two possible adjustments that can occur in offspring: 1) a delay in all aspects of development, or 2) trade-offs in development, for example favoring growth over investment in the immune system. Using non-invasive fecal hormone samples, this project will first identify the social and ecological factors of the environment that result in higher maternal stress hormones. Next, using behavioral observations, the researchers will examine if maternal stress levels impact maternal behavior towards their offspring. Lastly, the researchers will non-invasively assess four aspects of offspring development (growth rate, motor skill acquisition, time to independence, and immune function) to determine if offspring respond to maternal stress hormones by delaying all developmental markers or by making trade-offs.

"Proteins are the 'workhorse' molecules of life, they participate in nearly every activity that cells carry out. It follows that understanding protein structure and function is essential to understanding life processes, and how to control or modify them. Biochemistry and biophysics experiments give the most accurate data on protein structure and function, but the experiments are often expensive and too specialized for many of the cell and molecular biologists focused on a particular interesting protein. This means that reliable computational predictions of protein structure and function are in high demand. These techniques are also specialized but can be automated, which is the focus of this project, which aims to develop an integrated platform for high-resolution protein structure prediction and structure-based function annotation that is accessible from the Web. This resource will significantly enhance studies of individual proteins as well as processes in cellular biology and other biological sciences. Through the collaboration of the two institutions, students at NCAT will learn state of the art high performance computing methods, and workshops at both institutions will provide greater understanding of the capabilities of the new resource. 

Proteins are complex components of biological systems, and studies on their structure and function often require multiple approaches to measurement or modeling. Many of the advanced computer algorithms used in this modeling are highly specialized, involving a number of complicated processes for each aspect of the protein modeling. Biologists whose primary interest is the final result often cannot determine which algorithm or pipeline to choose, how to enter parameters, or how to interpret the resulting models. While continuing to improve the accuracy of the core algorithms in protein structure prediction and structure-based function annotation, this project will also make improvements to domain parsing and assembly, to improve the quality of complex protein structure and function modeling. Another major focus of this project is to develop new protocols that automatically guide protein targets to the most suitable pipelines. In conjunction with this there will be new confidence scoring systems, both global and local, to assist biological users as they interpret the modeling results. In addition, advanced parallel computing and graphic processor unit techniques will be implemented in order to accelerate the pipelines and reduce user's waiting time.  New opportunities will be made for improving educational outcomes, in particular for women and minority students, in both University of Michigan and the North Carolina A&T State University.

The project help develop GPU-I-TASSER, a GPU-enabled I-TASSER protein structure pipeline that is 10x faster than the existing I-TASSER pipeline which is one of the most successful protein structure prediction pipelines.

 

GPU-I-TASSER which is freely available to the scientific community, will be an invaluable tool to predict protein structure in proteome scale which is likely to be very useful in various other structural bioinformatics problems/topic areas. This would really accelerate the field of structural bioinformatics and accelerate use of structures(predicted) in various fields including drug discovery. 

 

Ability to predict protein structures efficiently brings broader impacts within and beyond the field of structural bioinformatics. In addition, student from underrepresented groups were trained in the intersection of biology and high-performance computing. More than 43 participants representing 13 different institutions including many HBCUs participated in the workshop. This will help in the diversity of the STEM field. In addition, workshops were conducted to share the knowledge with a large community of researchers. In addition, a book chapter and 2 journal articles and 2 conference papers were published using the results of the project.

"Skeletal remains are important sources of information on temporal trends in human health. Porous cranial lesions (PCLs) are interpreted as indicators of nutrient deficiencies and chronic infections and are among the most common pathological findings in human skeletal remains. This doctoral dissertation project uses methods previously applied primarily in archaeological contexts to investigating the causes of PCLs and the health of individuals who live with them. Specifically, the researchers will use an archaeological reference sample to develop computed tomography (CT) criteria for identifying PCLs in living individuals. They will then link measures of individual health to PCL findings from existing CT scans of a living population. Protocols and tools developed for PCL analysis will be made freely available online. The project will strengthen institutional capacity for future research collaborations and support STEM student training at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Because PCLs are developed during childhood, the methods developed in this proposal will have implications for public health across the lifespan. 

PCLs in archaeological samples have been interpreted as evidence of both stress and resilience. This project attempts to resolve this ambiguity by leveraging existing data drawn from a living population to test the association of PCLs in the orbits (cribra orbitalia) and the cranial vault (porotic hyperostosis) with known health profiles. First, the researchers will develop a protocol to extend archaeological methods to determining the prevalence of PCLs in a living population. Specifically, investigators will employ both visual assessments of CT scans and machine learning to reliably identify the presence and extent of PCLs on cranial CT scans using a reference sample of archaeological crania (n = 600). Once developed, investigators will apply the protocol to identify PCLs on existing cranial CTs of 1,310 living adults with known health profiles. This will link childhood development of PCLs to measures of later life health, including biological markers, medical diagnoses, and self-reported wellness. Finally, this project tests the common interpretation of PCLs as indicators of childhood anemia. Using biological markers from dried blood spot samples from children in the same population of living individuals (n = 480), investigators will identify the underlying causes of individual anemia cases and test their association with a biological marker of active bone remodeling.

These lesions are commonly reported by archaeologists as skeletal indicators of childhood stress, who attribute them to either infectious or nutritional causes in early life.

We first tested the sensitivity and accuracy of clinical computed tomography scans for identifying cranial lesions in living people by scanning archaeological crania with a range of lesion presentations. We found that moderate to severe cases of cranial porosity could be reliably documented from CT scans using settings intended to diagnose cranial fractures.  

We then evaluated existing head scans of adults aged 40+ years from the Tsimane population of Bolivia for cranial lesions presumably developed in early childhood. Using twenty years of health data from the Tsimane Health and Life History Project, we investigated the relationship between 1) cranial lesions and childhood health and 2) cranial lesions and morbidity in later life.

We found that cranial lesions were not associated with other measures of childhood illness or growth disruption (memories of childhood sickness; leg length relative to total height). However, we do find that shared childhood household is an independent predictor of lesion status, supporting the idea that childhood environment plays a role in the development of these skeletal lesions.

There is some evidence that cribra orbitalia is associated with immunocompromise in Tsimane adults, suggesting lifelong health consequences of lesion-causing processes in early life. Cribra orbitalia is associated with lower measures for some markers of adaptive immunity (fewer B cells, na?ve CD4+ T cells, and a lower ratio of total CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells) and with a greater risk of developing active tuberculosis. Cribra cranii, on the other hand, predicts double the risk of headaches but is not associated with notable differences in physiological measures.

We also assayed dried blood spots from Tsimane children for measures of iron deficiency (serum transferrin receptor), inflammation (C-reactive protein), and skeletal activity (osteocalcin) to investigate relationships between nutrient deficiency, infection, and processes of skeletal change during childhood. At the time of writing analyses are still underway, but initial explorations show a negative relationship between iron levels and skeletal activity, perhaps suggesting that childhood anemia, a known cause of cranial changes, is not the predominant cause of porous cranial lesions in this population.

"In this doctoral dissertation project, the investigator will use whole genome sequencing to examine how genetic networks encompassing hundreds of genes involved in regulating social behavior have evolved across sifakas, a behaviorally and ecologically diverse group of lemurs. This research will provide new insights about the genomic contributions to social behavioral evolution, and advance knowledge about the complex interplay of genetics, ecology, and the social environment in shaping primate behavior. The project may inform public health research, as some genetic pathways investigated in this project have also been implicated in the development and expression of various psychiatric illnesses. The project will also support primate conservation efforts, research and training opportunities, and research infrastructure at the study locations. The investigator will make all of their data publicly available, thereby providing additional research opportunities beyond the scope of this project. 

Many previous studies into the influences of genetics on social behavior have focused on examining single or few candidate genes and often only protein-coding portions of those genes. Here the researchers will take a whole genome sequencing approach to holistically examine the evolution of genomic regions involved in the development and expression of social behavior (i.e. ""sociogenomic"" regions) in sifakas. The researchers will generate a whole genome sequence for each of the eight sifaka species without a current reference genome. They will also sequence a woolly lemur individual to be able to identify genetic sequences that are unique to sifakas. Subsequently, they will subset the whole genome sequences to sociogenomic regions and examine their evolution. The researchers will specifically examine: (1) Whether sociogenomic regions have been significantly conserved across sifakas, indicative of evolutionary constraint (2) Evidence of selection acting on protein-coding portions of sociogenomic regions relative to differences in sifaka social and ecological environments and (3) The presence of accelerated evolution occurring in regions potentially involved in regulating the expression of sociogenomic genes.

How primate social behavior has evolved and the forces that have shaped it into the many forms sociality takes across over 500 primate species has long been a source of fascination among biologists. In this project, we investigated the evolution of social behavior of sifakas, a group of lemur species. We combined decades of behavioral and ecological data collected on wild sifakas by field primatologists. We first examined how the nine sifaka species vary in their social group traits, such as how large their groups are and how many males and females they contain. We then examined how variation in those social traits correlates to the ecological conditions the different sifaka species find themselves in. Echoing previous work on lemur behavioral ecology, we found multiple signs that the harsh ecological conditions of Madagascar impose high costs on the social lives of sifakas. Across species, sifakas have responded to these conditions by living in flexible social groups.

Next we are investigating how the interactions between sifaka social behavior and ecology are reflected in the evolution of their genomes. We?ve sequenced 27 high-quality whole genome sequences across all sifaka species and one species of closely related woolly lemur. In combination with additional whole genome sequences that have recently become available via the published work of others, we are working with a comprehensive set of 37 whole genomes. This is a powerful dataset that we?re incredibly excited to continue working with in order to explore the potential role of genetics in regulating primate social behavior. We will next be inferring an updated sifaka phylogeny, using the power of the whole genome to update our understanding of how the sifaka species are related to each other. This updated sifaka phylogeny will let us frame our understanding of sifaka social behavior and ecology within the context of their deep evolutionary history. Finally, we are examining how different evolutionary forces like selection have acted on thousands of sifaka genes. These genes are involved in regulating neural and hormonal processes that have been found to influence social behavior across animals.

Intellectual Merits

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the signatures of social behavior evolution across the whole genome in primates. We are excited for what we may learn about the relative contributions made by both genetics and the environment to the evolution of primate social behavior. Our study further underscores the social environment ? the types of groups individuals find themselves within and how individuals interact within groups ? as a nexus of the primate variation and adaptation. We also highlight the power of combining traditional approaches within behavioral ecology with comparative genomics to attain a holistic understanding of primate social evolution. Lemurs are an especially important group of primates for these lines of inquiry. Since lemurs retain various ancestral primate traits, studies like this project can provide important insights into early primate behavioral evolution which is notoriously difficult to do with the fossil record.

The comprehensive dataset of high-quality sifaka whole genome sequences developed for this project is a powerful tool for understanding the evolutionary history, behavioral ecology, and conservation dynamics of not just sifakas. Comparable datasets are currently available for only three other groups of primates: the great apes, baboons, and snub-nosed monkey. These are all Catarrhines (Old World monkeys and apes). This study thus makes an important contribution in generating a comparative genomic dataset for a group of the more distantly related Strepsirrhine primates that will be an important piece of the burgeoning field of primate comparative genomics.

Broader Impacts

This project required the development of several comparative datasets on sifaka behavior and ecology, collating information from over 100 primary sources. These data describe sifaka social behavior and ecology at multiple levels including across sifaka species, different populations within the same sifaka species, and among individual groups of sifakas as well. These data have never before been collated into one organized database. This sifaka database continues to be updated and will be made available via a web portal for download once all analyses are complete. Other researchers will also be able to make contributions to it, and the database will be an invaluable resource for both teaching and continued examinations into primate behavior, ecology, and evolution. Preliminary results from this project have already been shared with a variety of academic and non-academic audiences.

Additionally, the results of this study have a special bearing on the conservation of sifakas, all of which are endangered, some even critically endangered. The whole genome data sequenced for this project should prove especially invaluable for sifaka conservation, as they are a powerful tool for examining the population history, genetic diversity, and adaptability of these endangered Malagasy primates.

"The unprecedented accumulation of genomic data offers a unique opportunity to dive deep into the understanding of biology given appropriate tools to mine such data. This research will enable and accelerate the capabilities needed to realize the promise envisioned for big data genomics, and establish a new paradigm for genomics by fully exploiting the gamut of genomic datasets to better understand basis biology. Specifically, this project will combine robust statistical modeling and rigorous computational approaches toward predictive modeling of genomics data. Successful completion of the project will result in new knowledge, new tools, and most importantly long-lasting transformative enhancement of the usability and significance of genomic data. 

This project will have impact on education in genomics and bioinformatics at undergraduate and graduate levels and will outreach to K-12 students and underrepresented groups. To capitalize on the gamut of genomic data toward better understanding of biological systems, the community is in dire need of accurate, robust, scalable, and efficient methods to interpret such data toward predictive modeling of various phenotypes. Echoing the PI's overarching career goal of providing easy-to-use data analytics and software tools to computational and experimental scientists in life sciences, this research will result in a suite of tools that allow biologists to conduct novel scientific research in elucidating the landscape of genotype-phenotype relationships. The project will advance science through 1) novel Bayesian hierarchical models that incorporate domain knowledge to predict phenotypes from genotypes; 2) iterative pipelines to capitalize on the new models for uncovering the complex relationships between genotypes and phenotypes; and 3) new software modules integrated with existing data science infrastructure for scalable modeling and visualization of large-scale and high-dimensional genomic data.

"The process by which trauma experienced by one generation impacts the environment and biology of subsequent generations is referred to as ""transgenerational transmission.""

The project will advance knowledge about human biology and interactions between biology, culture and environment. Project outcomes may inform public health research and interventions for at-risk communities. The project will also support student training in a STEM field, and the research will be shared with local partners in education and health, as well as research and practice communities in early childhood development nationally and internationally. Resulting data will allow other researchers to validate or replicate findings in the growing research area of biological embedding and toxic stress. 

In recent decades, researchers have begun to investigate mechanisms that may help to explain the greater rates of psychological distress and chronic disease seen in children within populations that have experienced extreme stress and adversity. The present research will use questionnaire, hormone, and DNA methylation data to examine how maternal and grandmaternal experiences of trauma - especially those that occurred while the mother or child was in utero - impact child genetic expression and regulation of the stress response. Community-engaged research in this context provides a unique opportunity to study the transgenerational epigenetic transmission of trauma-related changes to the stress response and to learn about the risk and resilience factors that shape child development in the wake of war.

"In many primate species, males have much larger canines than do females, a character known as canine sexual dimorphism. In humans, the canines of males and females are very similar in size (monomorphic). This doctoral research project investigates the evolution and function of large male canine teeth in a model primate species to better understand potential selection pressures for dimorphism, and to use as comparative data to understand why the loss of this feature evolved in humans. This project provides training opportunities in both fieldwork and data analysis for undergraduate and graduate students in New York and Puerto Rico. 

This study will integrate morphological, genetic, and behavioral data to test the hypothesis that large male canines are a sexually selected signal and/or weapon in primates. This project also explores mechanisms of canine size evolution (heritability and selection). The Co-PI will collect data on canine size to investigate how canine size is inherited and whether canine size predicts reproductive success. She will also conduct field experiments to determine if males and females attend to differences in male canine size. Finally, she will integrate canine size data with behavioral data to assess whether canine size predicts the occurrence and outcome of fights between males.

"Cyanide is a poison that is common among plants and toxic to most animals. Nonetheless, three species of bamboo lemur focus most of their feeding time on various parts of Malagasy giant bamboo, which exposes the lemurs to 12-50 times their estimated lethal dose of cyanide on a daily basis. This project will examine the underlying physiology and genomics of cyanide detoxification in bamboo lemurs. In addition to addressing the decades-old puzzle of how these lemurs are able to consume high levels of cyanide, this study may inform the development of therapies, antidotes, or prophylactics to cyanide exposure in humans. During the course of this work, the PI and co-PI will invite and recruit undergraduates from Kent State University's McNair Scholars Program, whose mission is to help first-generation, low-income undergraduates matriculate to a doctoral degree program. The co-PI will also utilize close ties with Northeast Ohio's public libraries and schools to present this project to students and the general public.

The central questions of this study focus on known routes of cyanide detoxification among mammals. Low doses of the poison can be metabolized by a variety of conserved mechanisms, foremost among which is a pathway that uses sulfurtransferase enzymes. The limiting factors for this mechanism appear to be relative expression levels for these enzymes and the availability of sulfur-donor molecules (e.g., thiosulfate). Therefore, the first working hypothesis of this study is that H. aureus has adapted to detoxify its highly cyanogenic diet through positive selection on genes involved in the metabolism of sulfur or sulfur-containing amino acids. This hypothesis will be tested by assembling and mining a reference-quality genome for H. aureus and comparing it to data taken from a proposed genome assembly for Lemur catta, the most closely related species of dietary generalist. It is further hypothesized that H. aureus detoxifies its high levels of circulating cyanide through adaptive changes to the composition of the bloodstream. This second hypothesis will be tested by transcriptomic and metabolomic methods in order to compare the expression profiles and thiosulfate levels, respectively, of free-ranging H. aureus and captive L. catta. Together, these methods will examine adaptive changes in the H. aureus genome, as well as the whole-blood transcriptome and metabolome, which are related to the exceptional cyanide tolerance of this species.

"Humans evolved very large brains relative to their body size, with a remarkable enrichment of neurons in the cerebral cortex. Extensive efforts in anthropology have focused on delineating the adaptive pressures that led to these changes during human evolution. However, the genetic changes underlying human brain expansion have not been fully explored. This project will test hypotheses about human brain evolution by studying the impact of human genetic variation on brain development using experimental models. This research has broad implications for understanding what makes the human brain unique at the cellular and molecular levels, with translational value for medical treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. During this research, undergraduate students pursuing careers in STEM will be mentored and trained in molecular biology and bioinformatics techniques in the laboratory. Research findings will be used as 1) an educational tool for spreading knowledge about human evolution and genetics with the general public, K-12 students, and undergraduate students, as well as 2) a motivational platform for the young, future women scientists in the Females Excelling More in Mathematics, Engineering and Science (FEMMES) Program. 

The proposed research takes a multi-disciplinary approach to investigate how human evolutionary history has shaped the molecular and physiological mechanisms of human brain expansion. In the laboratory, human and non-human primate neural cells will be studied to explore how genetic variation evolved in humans to shape the developing brain. This project uses a combination of gene editing, RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry to determine the functional role of human-specific genetic sequence during brain development that corresponds to changes in brain size. These findings will advance the understanding of the molecular evolution of the human brain.

Research in anthropology has helped delineate the adaptive pressures on brain expansion during our evolution. However, the genetics underlying human brain expansion, favored by natural selection, have not been well-explored. Prime candidates for the evolution of human brain expansion are genes that are unique to humans, disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders, and expressed in neural progenitor cells (NPCs)?the cells that build the brain by determining the number of neurons. In this study, we investigate the function of candidate NBPF genes, which have expanded in number in primate genomes and exceptionally in the human genome (Figure 1). This project experimentally tests hypotheses about human molecular origins by investigating the impact of human-specific genes on the development of the human cerebral cortex as well as establish a functional model for studying brain evolution. 

            Human and chimpanzee in vitro brain organoids?3D structures differentiated from stem cells that mimic in vivo brains?provide an unprecedented opportunity to generate functional data on how human-specific genetic changes shape the developing brain. Here, we used a two-step strategy to investigate the genetics of human cortical expansion: 1) gene editing to evaluate the effect of rapidly evolved human-specific genes in human brain organoids, and 2) genetic introduction of human genes into chimpanzee organoids to identify developmental mechanisms that determine cortex size.

            Expression of NBPF proteins has changed throughout primate evolution, resulting in novel expression of human NBPF proteins in NPCs. In this study, we found that NBPF proteins localize to the cytoplasm in human NPCs and show peak expression at microtubules during cell division (Figure 2). Compared to human NPCs, chimpanzee NPCs express very low levels of NBPF protein. We found evidence that NBPF proteins interact with each other, as well as other proteins that are important for cytoskeleton dynamics and communication with the extracellular matrix in human NPCs (Figure 3). Disruption to these aspects of cell biology during brain development can lead to clinical microcephaly (abnormally small brain). 

            Dynamic balance between NPC proliferation and differentiation informs neuronal identity and number. To investigate the role of human-specific NBPF in brain development, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing to deplete the expression of NBPF protein in NPCs. Using human brain organoid models, we observed a significant decrease in the number of proliferating cells, resulting in smaller organoids (Figure 4). In addition, NPCs in NBPF-depleted organoids started to differentiate to neurons earlier than control organoids, which acts to reduce the number of total neurons. Altogether, our findings support the hypothesis that NBPFs in human brain development influence NPC activity that is important to build a human brain. 

            Findings from this work have important implications for addressing interdisciplinary questions about human brain evolution as well as the role of NBPF proteins in neurodevelopmental disorders. This project has offered great opportunities for science communication and outreach locally and nationally, as well as mentorship and training.

"Bipedal locomotion is a hallmark trait of the human evolutionary lineage, representing a major transition away from the apes and other primates. This pivotal shift can be investigated through studies of the neck, as the human neck is adapted to balance and stabilize the head during bipedal movements. This doctoral research project will test how the shape of the bones of the neck relate to locomotion and posture in a diverse sample of mammals. The findings will be used to interpret fossilized neck bones from extinct human relatives to learn about their early forms of bipedalism, as well as potentially informing clinical research. This project will also support the sharing of three-dimensional scan data through digital repositories and the training and mentorship of student researchers, including those from groups underrepresented in scientific fields. 

Cervical vertebrae in the hominin fossil record can provide insight into the interplay between the head, neck and trunk during key locomotor and postural transitions. Currently, however, functional interpretations of these fossils are limited to broad categories such as ""human-like"" neck mobility or ""ape-like"" neck posture. The goal of this dissertation is to improve hominin neck reconstructions by experimentally testing how cervical vertebral shape relates to neck function, locomotor mode, and trunk posture. This goal will be addressed in three objectives: 1) quantify the relationship between vertebral shape and neck mobility using bending mechanics experiments, 2) develop neck posture models in living species using virtual reconstruction methods, and 3) evaluate patterns of vertebral shape change across diverse mammalian groups using phylogenetic comparative methods. The objectives will be tested in a broad sample of primates, rodents, and marsupials. These groups contain species with independently-evolved forms of bipedal locomotion and upright trunk posture, allowing for independent verification of form-function relationships. This project will provide the foundational data necessary to quantitatively interpret functional information from cervical vertebral fossils, furthering our understanding of the nature and biomechanical demands of bipedalism in early hominins.

"In this doctoral research project, the investigator will examine biological pathways through which exposure to social stress can affect physiological well-being. The research will focus on Native American populations who are historically understudied yet experience high levels of stress-related disparities. Stress physiology will be assessed using various biomarkers, including salivary cortisol, blood pressure (BP), and additional biometric data. Semi-structured interviews, demographic questionnaires, psychometric measures, and identity scales will be used to assess how cultural identity, psychosocial stress, historical trauma, health status and stress physiology interact. The results of this research will advance understanding of how seemingly unrelated psychological mechanisms and social environments may contribute to disparities in physiological well-being among minority populations in the United States. The project will also support student training and science outreach activities, including among groups underrepresented in STEM fields. 

This project will investigate the relationship between psychosocial stress, stress physiology, and physiological disparities by assessing: 1: the prevalence of diagnosed and suspected stress-related conditions in an Indigenous Community in the Pacific Northwest (ICPN); 2: allostatic load (chronic stress) in members of ICPN, as defined by an Allostatic Load Index (ALI) comprising neuroendocrine, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune system biomarkers; and 3: the relationship between variation in HPA-axis regulation (stress physiology) and allostatic load, and stress-related disease occurrence, Indigenous ancestry, historical trauma, and cultural identity in ICPN. This project moves away from a research focus on purely biological factors in understanding racial disparities, toward a holistic understanding of how unequal social and psychological environments negatively impact physiological well-being.

"In recent decades, research has underscored the importance of early life experiences, especially those that occur in utero, as factors that influence biological outcomes across the life course. Growing evidence suggests that some early life biological effects, such as those triggered by psychosocial stress, can persist into adulthood and in some cases influence offspring and grandoffspring development. This doctoral research project will use existing survey data, and newly collected data and biological samples, to examine life course and intergenerational effects of early life stress experienced by now young-adult mothers who were exposed to highly adverse social conditions.  The research will advance knowledge about potential biological pathways of multigenerational effects of stress in humans, and contribute more broadly to our understanding of the complex interplay between human biology and culture. The outcomes of this project will contribute valuable data that may inform public health research and policy. The project will also support student training, international research collaborations, and science outreach activities. 

Researchers have proposed that there may be multigenerational pathways of biological ""memory"" whereby an individual's biology reflects not only their own experiences and that of their mothers, but potentially also their grandmothers' experiences. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is a central component of the body's system of stress response and is among the candidate outcomes likely to be influenced by such multigenerational plasticity. This study provides a unique opportunity to trace the long-term impacts of early life stress exposure to biological and social disparities, focusing on both the physiology and well-being of exposed individuals, and the birth outcomes and stress physiology of their unexposed offspring. This project will utilize existing and newly collected data for a cohort of women, their children, and grandchildren, that has been followed for nearly 30 years and that experienced highly adverse social and environmental conditions. The investigators will first assess long-term effects of the mother's stress experiences during her own early life on her adult biology and well-being, before exploring downstream impacts on her offspring.

"Nutritional and energetic models of human metabolism assume that all dietary fats have the same caloric value. However, recent developments in gut microbiome research have challenged this view, with gut microbial communities shifting in response to different fat-rich diets, and the resulting gut microbiota differentially impacting energy gain. This dissertation project will examine the role of dietary fat types on energy gain from a human holobiont perspective, which interrogates both host and microbial mechanisms of energy harvest from different dietary fat sources. By assessing the impact of dietary fat type on host-microbial interactions, the investigators aim to better understand the process of dietary fat metabolism in ancestral and modern humans, to challenge traditional models of the isocaloric nature of fats, and to gain insight into associations between dietary fat intake and increasing rates of metabolic disease in industrial populations. Apart from contributing to the peer-reviewed scientific literature, this research will facilitate undergraduate research opportunities, particularly for women and underrepresented minorities in science, who presently comprise 80% of the laboratory research staff. In addition, through connections with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, the investigators have committed to contributing to programs that make science accessible for a broad public audience. 

The trillions of microbes that reside in the human gut are now understood to play important roles in digestion and energy regulation. However, to date, models of past and present human energy budgets have not considered the microbial contributions to energy harvested from diet. In this research, the investigators will probe mechanisms of dietary fat metabolism that involve both host and microbial processes, evaluating the impacts of different dietary fats on host energy budget, intestinal fat absorption and inflammation, gut microbial composition, and direct gut microbial contributions to host energy status. To address these processes, the investigators will use conventional and germ-free murine models, which are routinely used for studying the effects of microbial community shifts on human physiology. This research will clarify the role that different dietary fats have played in the evolution of human energy metabolism, and will suggest new pathways for targeting the high and rising rates of obesity, type II diabetes, and other metabolic diseases in the industrialized world.

Modern nutrition guidelines treat the energetic contribution of fat as equal regardless of fat type. However, this framework of fat metabolism does not adequately explain why differences in dietary fat are linked to such varying metabolic health outcomes, particularly in the case of obesity. One potential contributor to these discrepancies is the gut microbiome. Recent advances in microbiome research have shed light on the digestive partnership between humans and our resident gut microbes, and evidence suggests that gut microbes respond rapidly and reproducibly to dietary shifts, including changes in fat consumption. Therefore, in order to understand the impacts of dietary fat type on host energy gain and metabolic health, we must consider the role of host-microbial interactions in fat metabolism.

This research addresses whether different dietary fat types alter metabolic phenotypes via host and microbial mechanisms, and investigates the extent to which the gut microbial community plays a direct role in shaping host phenotype under different dietary fat conditions. In a series of mouse experiments, we explored the potential host-microbial interactions involved in a holobiont view of dietary fat metabolism. We first determined the role of dietary fat type in shaping host energy gain and metabolic response in conventional mice, including metrics of fat digestion and absorption. We then explored how the metabolic effects of fat type induce downstream changes to the structure and function of the gut microbiome. Finally, we used germ-free and gnotobiotic mouse models to examine the direct gut microbial contributions to host physiology under different dietary fat conditions. 

In experimental feeding trials using C57BL/6J mice, isocaloric high-fat diets that vary in fat type resulted in significantly different effects on total body mass and percent adiposity, particularly when comparing saturated versus &omega;-3 polyunsaturated fat sources. Dietary fats associated with enhanced energy gain were also associated with increased host expression of markers for bile acid production, inflammatory response, and gut epithelial integrity. Dietary fat type also impacted downstream gut microbial community composition and abundance. High-fat diets associated with upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and gut epithelial integrity genes corresponded with the enrichment of microbial taxa implicated in enhanced energy harvest, inflammation, and gut epithelial homeostasis. When assessing the extent to which the gut microbiota can directly influence host energy gain from different dietary fats, gnotobiotic transplant experiments determined that dietary preconditioning in donor mice amplified the energy harvesting capacity of the microbiota in recipient mice consuming the same dietary fat type.

This work sheds light on mechanistic variation in how different fats are digested, supports the role of host-microbial interactions in fat metabolism, and advocates for re-evaluating estimates of energy gain from fats in ancestral and modern human diets. Considering the scope of these interactive pathways also provides an essential lens for our understanding of human evolution and the role of dietary fat in shaping human phenotypes. By determining the impacts of differences in both dietary fat level and type on the holobiont, we can develop a better understanding of how human-microbial interactions may contribute to diet-associated metabolic disease in industrialized populations.

This project has facilitated opportunities for advising undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds in pursuit of research experiences and senior thesis projects, and has led to student co-authorship on forthcoming publications. The interdisciplinary nature of this project has also encouraged broad public engagement through educational outreach at the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, and promoted scientific discourse across a range of disciplines, from nutritional epidemiology to evolutionary medicine.

"While longevity is often described as a uniquely human trait, other apes like chimpanzees also have extended lifespans, living twice as long as monkeys or lemurs. However, we don't fully understand the effects of aging on apes in the wild or which aspects of human longevity are unique. This doctoral research project will investigate how wild male chimpanzees age physiologically and behaviorally with a focus on how aging impacts foraging ability, which may reveal how frailty impacts fitness. The findings will help clarify whether chimpanzees' feeding behavior and performance change with age, and whether foraging could play an important role in shaping their patterns of senescence. This research will fill gaps in our knowledge on the senescence of male primate skeletal biology and may help to clarify whether fertility maintained late in life contributes to the evolution of extended lifespan. The investigators will engage in educational activities in the United States and near the research site in rural Uganda, and foster international research collaborations and capacity building. In addition, the continued presence of researchers in Kibale National Park helps protect one of the last tropical rainforests in all of East Africa, which is notably one of the principal strongholds of chimpanzees in this area.

The proposed research will investigate aging in male chimpanzees living in an exceptionally large community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. The investigators will assess the physiological traits of adult male chimpanzees at various ages to assess how bone density, body mass, chewing ability, and energetic status may decrease in old age. To this end, the research will non-invasively collect and analyze fecal samples to assess chewing efficiency as well as urine samples to measure insulin biomarkers (an indicator of energetic status) and collagen biomarkers to investigate decreases in bone density. Behavioral observations will also be carried out to assess how these physical changes may impact movement, food selection, ingestion rates, mating effort, and sociality. Through a systematic study of aging male chimpanzees' physiology and behavior, this research aims to elucidate the processes of aging and its impact on fitness in wild animals.

"Old World monkeys are found across Africa and Asia today with various physical and behavioral adaptations that allow them to survive and coexist in a range of habitats. Fossils from Africa show a similar pattern of Old World monkey diversity and coexistence in the past, although not all of these fossil species survived to the present. This doctoral dissertation project will examine how Old World monkey communities change in response to local environmental conditions and why some species within these communities are more successful than others. Dental features associated with dietary adaptations will be used to reconstruct the ecologies of living and fossil Old World monkeys and to compare across communities from different temporal and geographic settings. This will provide long-term context for understanding the present-day diversity of Old World monkey communities and for predicting potential responses of these communities to ongoing and future environmental change. This project will directly engage undergraduates in research, including students from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM. Photographs and measurement data will be made freely available online to other researchers; they will also be used to create written articles and educational materials shared with local schools and museums, and posted online for the general public on the AskAnAnthropologist.asu.edu website.

A range of climatic, ecological, biogeographical, and phylogenetic hypotheses have been proposed to explain how and why present-day primate communities contain certain combinations of species and adaptations. This project uses a broad temporal and geographic sample of Old World monkey communities in Africa and Asia today and in the African fossil record to systematically test hypotheses linking species diversity, adaptation, and extinction with local environmental phenomena. Dental metric data will be used to create a multivariate model of the Old World monkey ecomorphological niche, from which the researchers will calculate and compare community niche volumes, positions, and overlap. Model selection will then be used to evaluate the relative influence of climate factors, habitat structure, mammalian competition, and dispersal barriers in leading communities to have similar or distinct ecomorphological niches. As Old World monkeys are well-represented in the fossil and present-day communities, they provide an ideal model for understanding complex patterns of diversity and extinction in the past, present, and future.

This model was tested against data on species dietary resource use in living monkey species, which confirmed that the dental model accurately reflected patterns of ecological diversity in these communities. We then gathered data on modern and past climate systems and habitat types to analyze the relative impacts of these factors in shaping patterns of monkey community diversity today.

Based on the dental model, we found that monkey communities in Asia today are structured by geography and past climate systems. This is consistent with other research that suggests that monkey communities in this region have been strongly affected by changing sea levels that would have opened up or closed off connections between islands and limited the ability of species to travel and form new communities. In Africa today, monkey communities are instead influenced by modern and recent rainfall patterns. We did not find any strong effects of modern human activity on monkey community structure, despite our expectations.

Fossil monkey communities in Africa were similar to their modern counterparts in Africa and Asia, particularly those that are found in more seasonal or temperate habitats. In the dental model, these fossil communities were shown to be different from modern sites based on having multiple large-bodied species present, including some large leaf-eating monkeys that are unlike any found in Africa or Asia today. This is opposite the pattern found in many African communities today that may have multiple small-bodied species found together, but only one or two large-bodied species at each site. Fossil sites were also generally similar to one another except in some comparisons between older and younger sites, and between sites found in East vs. South Africa. This suggests that these communities may have been similar to modern Asian communities in being limited by species' abilities to travel between the different regions or changes as they evolved through time.

Our results confirm that environments in the past were likely different from any found today in that they could support many larger-bodied primate species that co-existed on the landscape. This is broadly consistent other research on fossil communities and on specific mammal groups such as carnivores and large herbivores, and this also matches the pattern we see in the human fossil record. We hope that we or other future researchers can integrate our dental model of monkey communities with comparable data on other mammals to better understand how species have evolved together over the past several million years in Africa, and how that contributes to patterns of diversity we see around the globe today.

"This doctoral dissertation research will assess the impact of historical decision-making processes on the Biological Anthropology collections at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History (NMNH). In addition to being snapshots of once living populations, biological anthropology collections are valuable repositories of past anthropologists' collection management strategies. The legacies and decisions, like ones made by Ales Hrdlicka at the NMNH, changed how collections of human remains were formed, accessioned, and cared for in museums. Understanding how collections were treated in the past will help museums make informed decisions about destructive sampling requests, allow researchers to optimize study design, and help to establish museum care standards with modern scientific methods (e.g. DNA sequencing) in mind. This project will contribute to STEM education by providing training opportunities for undergraduates through the Smithsonian Fellowship Program and Co-PI Austin's dissertation research. Additionally, the public will be engaged at events like the ""Expert Is In"" talk series at the NMNH, presentations at the NMNH and department presentations at the University of Oklahoma.

To investigate the impact of changing collection care strategies on biological anthropology collections, this project will focus on biomolecular (DNA) preservation in dental calculus (calcified plaque). Dental calculus from anthropological collections has been used to address important questions concerning the health, diet, and population dynamics of past peoples. However, variation in dental calculus development and preservation across human populations is underexplored. By taking into consideration multiple lines of evidence (i.e. ancient DNA sequencing, skeletal and morphological data, and archival information) from temporally and geographically representative collections, this study will investigate 1) how environmental factors contribute to dental calculus formation and 2) how collection care decisions by past biological anthropologists have affected the long-term storage of collections. As a world-leading museum, the NMNH offers extraordinary collections with spatial and temporal depth to address these two objectives and will provide valuable information to other collections around the world.

Dental calculus from anthropological collections has been used to address important questions concerning the health, diet, and population dynamics of past peoples. By taking into consideration multiple lines of evidence (i.e. ancient DNA sequencing, skeletal and morphological data, and archival information) from temporally and geographically representative collections, this study investigated how collection care decisions by past biological anthropologists have affected the long-term preservation of collections’ biomolecules through the assessment of ancient DNA metagenomics from dental calculus.

Project results identified dental calculus across all collections, revealing the presence of dental calculus to be innate to the human oral cavity. The amount of dental calculus observed varied across individuals and populations (collections). Unfortunately, assessing differences among the amount of dental calculus and environmental depositional factors (e.g. diet, social structure, etc.) was obscured by postmortem processing and handling. Post-mortem dental calculus removal by curators/collection staff was observable.

In addition to being snapshots of once living populations, this project emphasizes and identifies biological anthropology collections as valuable repositories of past anthropologists’ collection management strategies. Archival data revealed the unique histories of each collection&mdash;no two were the same, even though several were prepared for anatomical study at similar times. Curatorial decisions, like ones made by Ale&scaron; Hrdli&#269;ka at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), directed how collections of human remains were formed, accessioned, and cared for in museums.

Mirroring the collection-specific preservation histories, the total amount of DNA extracted varied by collection. The Japanese collection yielded significantly more DNA than all other collections. In contrast, recovered microbial community compositions were largely the same across collections (populations), potentially indicating the oral microbiome to be largely conserved over time within humans regardless of diet, social practices, and location.

Results have been disseminated among Smithsonian Institution Anthropology curators, for national and international audiences through presentations in the fields of anthropology and biological sciences. The project provided data collection and museum experience opportunities, as well as professional development for graduate and undergraduate students through close mentorship with Smithsonian curators and public outreach opportunities at the National Museum of Natural History and the University of Oklahoma. This project has resulted in a completed dissertation and drafted scientific manuscript, as well as created an on-going conversation, in the form of workshops and consortiums, about human skeletal collection care, ethics, curation, policy, and research between project PIs and the Smithsonian Institution.

"Humans have unique upright body posture and related anatomy, but paleontologists are not certain when these features first appeared in the hominin lineage. The aim of this doctoral research project is to functionally describe the anatomy of the primate neck to understand how differences in the neck are related to head posture, body posture, and locomotion in primates. The project will provide data that may be used for inferring when a human-like neck first appeared and how this anatomical change was associated with environmental, behavioral and biological factors. This study will employ a combination of 3D anatomical methods including CT scanning, digital muscle fascicle tracking, and biomechanical modeling, which will serve as training tools for future researchers and health care professionals. The 3D models generated in this study will be used in K-12 science education and outreach events for discussing human anatomy and primate conservation.

The objective of this study is to both characterize and quantify neck muscle anatomy in primates with different habitual body postures and locomotor behaviors. Using a biomechanical framework, the project will compare functional differences in neck musculature that are key for behaviors such as holding up the head and movement of the arms during suspension. Novel techniques including contrast-enhanced computed tomography, muscle fascicle tracking software, and 3D lever mechanics will be used to develop biomechanical models of how variation in muscle size, shape, and distribution is related to postural and locomotor behavior across primates. These biomechanical models will be applied to fossil hominins (Australopithecus sediba and Homo neanderthalensis) to interpret their neck anatomy and posture to more accurately understand and reconstruct their behaviors.

The ways in which the individual bones and muscles are arranged both internally and externally, can help us understand their function. The neck is a complex structure in that it supports the head, helps an organism navigate through its environment, and participates in feeding and swallowing. Primates are noted for diversity in locomotor behaviors, diet, as well as large brains relative to body size. As such, the head, neck, and musculature that spans between them can be potentially tied to any or all these functions.

While we know that species such as Australopithecus afarensis, which includes ?Lucy,? were bipedal, we still do not understand how their head was positioned relative to their trunk (i.e., neck posture) nor how much time they may have spent in trees. Further, we know that the ?Lucy? species was likely not the first upright biped in our lineage. In fossil human ancestors, the shape and size of the bones of the nuchal plane and cervical vertebrae (back of the head and neck) are thought to be a functional complex that helps balance and support of the head, rotates the neck, and serves as an anchor point to muscles involved in forelimb suspension. In particular, the position and the orientation of the foramen magnum and nuchal plane (parts of the cranium) and anatomy of the cervical vertebrae (neck bones), are used to make inferences about our own lineage and when and in what species upright posture and bipedal locomotion first appeared. Yet, no study to date has been able to quantify and understand how these muscles and bones work together to facilitate postural and locomotor behaviors. The goal of this study was to bridge our gap in knowledge on this subject using a variety of innovative techniques to understand how the neck works in our closest living relatives? the extant primates?before applying our knowledge to extinct species like our own fossil ancestors.

To understand how the nuchal muscles work across primates, this study used traditional dissection methods, contrast enhanced MicroCT scanning, as well as 3D lever mechanics to assess functional hypotheses. We sought to answer how postural and locomotor behaviors affect the size, shape and attachment sites of the muscles that span the back of the head and neck in a sample of primate cadavers. Specifically, this study was able to develop and apply new methods of semi-automatic muscle fascicle tracking, which allows for relatively non-invasive ways of quantifying muscle fascicle orientation, length, and number which are components of muscle function.

Results demonstrate that the shape and inferred function of the nuchal muscles do not reflect postural and locomotor behaviors as strongly as previously thought. There are a few exceptions to this finding. The first is that primates that have upright postures, like humans, demonstrate reduced force generation in a small muscle that extend the head and neck (longissimus capitis) compared to primates that have horizontal trunk postures. Second, primates that engage in vertical-clinging and leaping, like sifaka lemurs and the tarsier, may have modified neck muscles that allow them to rotate their head and neck more readily. Further, suspensory and semisuspensory behaviors (i.e., hanging from the arms) may influence the attachment size and orientation of the trapezius muscle in some primates, but this may not necessarily translate to an overall more powerful trapezius muscle.

Combined, these findings suggest that there may be more variables at play in determining the function nuchal musculature. More research is required to understand how the size and shape of the face and head, which house vital organs like the brain, affect the size and shape of the posterior neck muscles before making claims about how early human ancestors used their necks to interact with their environments.

"To fully understand biological systems, as well as realize their full potential, it is essential to integrate research methods and perspectives from the different subdisciplines of biology (including behavior, biophysics, molecular and cellular biology, developmental biology, ecology, evolution, genetics, neurobiology, physiology, systematics, and systems biology). However, how to integrate these subdisciplines is unclear, given the increasingly specialized training in the diversity of analytical and methodological approaches used in different biological fields. Similarly, it is uncertain what new infrastructure - physical and workforce - is needed to achieve a true integration. The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Science will convene an ambitious combination of virtual town halls, microlabs and jumpstart meetings, facilitated by Knowinnovation, to engage the broader biological community and solicit input regarding: 1) the exciting new research questions that could be addressed by combining approaches and perspectives from different subdisciplines of biology, 2) the key challenges and scientific gaps that must be addressed to answer these questions, and 3) the physical infrastructure and workforce training needed. Invitations to participate in the workshops will be posted on the websites of professional societies that span the biological subdisciplines, and participants will be selected with the goal of achieving breadth in expertise, career stage, gender, and members of groups underrepresented in the sciences. Products from the workshops will include a series of publications identifying the opportunities and challenges for integrating across biological subdisciplines and new ways to tackle some of the most challenging biological questions. Results will stimulate new discovery and approaches addressing major societal challenges in the training of next-generation biologists, the response of living systems to changing environments, and the development of sustainable biological resources supporting human populations.

The successful identification of how best to integrate the subdisciplines of biology requires the input and participation of a broad range of researchers across scientific subdisciplines, career levels, and expertise. Two virtual town halls, each with a maximum of 500 participants spanning the biology subdisciplines, will first identify a broad set of common themes. These virtual town halls will be followed by four virtual microlabs of up to 100 participants each (400 people total) to continue refining themes that will be addressed in a combination of in-person and virtual Jumpstart meetings. The fresh thinking and innovative approaches that will emerge from these workshops will advance understanding and further predictive capability of how key properties of living systems emerge from the interaction of genomes, phenotypes, and environment acting over space and time. Identifying the interdisciplinary research needs for integrating biology promises to address key gaps in the basic understanding of biological systems and lead to new insights into the mechanisms regulating the diversification, maintenance, and loss of life on earth, plus novel ways of studying biological interactions across hierarchical levels of organization and species.

The project will also support student training and mentoring of individuals from unrepresented groups in STEM, supporting broader participation in a rapidly developing area of biological research.

Humans living a Western-industrialized lifestyle have markedly different microbiomes than those living a more traditional, non-industrial lifestyle, such as hunter-gatherers and rural farmers from developing countries. Earlier studies have determined that diet, antibiotic use, and contact between humans and other animals all have major impacts on microbiome diversity. In a number of these studies, the way in which microbial diversity was estimated did not necessarily account for the fact that microbiomes are complex ecologies. In this study, the researchers will investigate ecological dynamics and microbial interactions in microbiomes from humans and pigs on family farms in Oklahoma and compare them to humans and pigs from the African country of Burkina Faso. By comparing both humans and pigs in an industrialized country to a developing country, the researchers will document the effects of lifestyle on the human microbiome with a focus on human-animal interactions. By investigating the ecological dynamics of functional redundancy and resilience in gut microbiomes, the project will advance knowledge about complex microbial ecology.

In both publications, we contribute to the developing field of human microbial ecology in an effort to better understand these complex ecosystems. To date, much of microbiome research has lacked an ecological theory component and given the heavy focus on industrialized areas, microbiome studies have been like ""studying forest ecology by only examining city parks"". We demonstrate that this history has created major biases in how we understand the microbiome. These two publications focused on expanding applications of ecological theory to understudied human microbiome systems, including novel data from a contemporary population living a non-industrial lifestyle (Burkina Faso), as well as ancient Central American (Belize) and European (Sardinia) populations. Both publications involve in-depth ecological analysis of one of the more important aspects of the microbiome, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. SCFA are absolutely critical small molecules for maintaining a healthy gut. We study the microbiome in terms of ecological parameters, such as ""resilience"", the ability of the microbiome ecology to maintain itself when facing disturbances. Although studying ancient and non-industrial gut microbiomes presents unique challenges, such as limited reference databases, we discover that ancient and contemporary non-industrial gut microbiomes tend to be more resilient in their SCFA production than their industrial counterparts.
David Jacobson has one more first-authored publication accepted after peer review from his dissertation, and while this grant did not support this publication financially, the DDIG award permitted the above microbiome ecology manuscripts to be published in a timely fashion, freeing up time to complete this other publication.
Furthermore, the award has also supported two additional works that are forthcoming:
One, the training and data analyses used to provide summary microbiome data for the above SCFA paper also provided contextual data to a study of the human core metabolome. At the time of this report, the manuscript for this metabolome study is under peer-review.
Two, as initially proposed, the grant supported a study of antibiotic resistance genes and taxa. All data are collected for this manuscript and analyses are ongoing. One clear finding is that we estimate greater diversity in antibiotic resistance associate genes within the microbiome of more traditional populations than we do industrial population. This counter-intuitive finding may have an ecological explanation, which we are currently assessing.
The DDIG also provided the opportunity for David Jacobson to train an undergraduate student from the University of Oklahoma in molecular anthropology. The undergraduate student was trained in all aspects of state-of-the-art microbiome research, including DNA and RNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), generating high quality DNA sequencing data from a Illumina MiSeq machine, and bioinformatic data analysis. DDIG funds were then used to support the undergraduate student lead her own project on the human microbiome, which she presented at the University of Oklahoma’s Undergraduate Research Symposium.

"Unlike chronological age (the number of years a person has lived), biological age accounts for environmental, genetic and lifestyle factors that influence the pace of age-related changes. Diet is thought to be one such factor; however, the relationship between diet and biological aging is not well understood, and efforts to characterize this relationship have struggled to disentangle the effects of diet from other variables. This doctoral dissertation project will examine the effect of diet on the rate of biological aging using a newly developed epigenetic clock, a biomarker of biological age. This fundamental research will advance knowledge about human biology, life history, and senescence. The project may also inform public health and aging research by quantifying how lifestyle factors like diet ""get under the skin"" to influence the aging process and age-related disease. In addition, this project will contribute to the education, training and professional development of a female graduate student in a STEM field, and will include science outreach and education activities to engage with K-12 and public audiences.

The mechanisms that regulate the rate of biological aging are unknown but may have origins in the epigenome, a collection of chemical modifications to DNA that influence how genes are turned on or off. The epigenome is able to connect environment to genetics, and therefore plays a key role in explaining how environment and lifestyle factors can shape the pace of biological aging at the molecular level. Recently, age predictor models called epigenetic clocks have been developed that use age-associated changes in the epigenome to generate estimates of biological age. These clocks can be used to study the phenomenon of accelerated aging, where biological age exceeds chronological age. This project will construct a multi-tissue epigenetic clock and use this clock to test the effect of diet on biological age in a non-human primate model. The central hypothesis of this research is that an obesogenic diet accelerates biological aging and caloric restriction slows biological aging. The researchers will collect and analyze genome-wide methylation data from banked liver samples using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and combine these data with previously collected RRBS data from blood samples. A comparative non-human primate model with similar life history and disease risk can provide important insights into human aging.

Disparities in the rate of disease and mortality among same-aged individuals represents differences in how we age (referred to as biological aging) and emphasizes the need for better tools that can be used to identify environmental factors that slow or accelerate the aging process. This research addressed this need by producing and testing a sequence data-based, liver-specific epigenetic clock. The epigenome represents chemical modifications to the genome that control how genes work and can be responsive to environmental or behavioral changes, like changes in one’s diet. Epigenetic clocks capture modifications to the genome that correlate with chronological age and disease risk. Some individuals age at a pace that is faster or slower than others, suggesting aspects of behavior and environment are able to ""get under the skin"" and affect one’s propensity to age-related disease, disability, and mortality. We chose to develop an epigenetic clock for liver because the liver plays a central role in all metabolic processes of the body, and its continued functionality is critical to maintaining our health as we age. We developed this model for rhesus macaques, a long-lived, social non-human primate that is a highly relevant model for human aging. We applied our model to estimate biological age from liver samples and identify factors related to metabolism that accelerate or decelerate the pace of aging. Bioinformatic and statistical workflows generated by this research will be of use to researchers in the biological and biomedical sciences interested in generating or utilizing a sequence data-based epigenetic biomarker to test how environment shapes the aging process and influences predisposition to aging-related disease. Datasets generated from this study will be a valuable resource for researchers investigating the relationship between epigenetics, aging, and metabolism.

Broader Impact

While life expectancy in the United States has risen dramatically over the past several decades, the number of years spent free of major age-related disease and disability has remained relatively static.  This discrepancy and consequent reduction in the quality-of-life of many older individuals is a major public health concern. Knowledge and tools resulting from this study contribute to a larger body of research that seeks to understand the effects of personal and societal factors on the aging trajectory and how these factors contribute to variation observed in the aging process. A better understanding of why some individuals age more rapidly than others will better inform intervention strategies, policy decisions, and may help clinicians identify sub-clinical risk factors before they manifest as full-fledged disease, which may in turn help improve long-term health outcomes.

The funded research also supported the training of a PhD student at the University of Oregon. As part of this study, this student received advanced training in computer programming, bioinformatics, genomics, and statistics and gained considerable experience in these areas. This research has also enabled the student to grow her professional network to include a group of highly successful colleagues with different skill sets, perspectives and connections, both within and outside of academia. Importantly, this dissertation research will produce a PhD that contributes to a STEM field and increase diversity within areas of research where women are currently underrepresented. In addition, this research has also been used to support the training of an undergraduate as she completes her honor’s thesis and in undergraduate teaching at the University of Oregon. For example, we developed an interactive bioinformatics module for an intermediate genomics course that introduces bioinformatics to undergraduates and seeks to breakdown existing stereotypes of who can do this type of science through discussion and leading by example.

"The 1918 influenza pandemic has been studied from the perspectives of epidemiologists, historians, virologists, and social scientists, providing increasingly more insight on how biology and culture interact to result in unequal mortality outcomes. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate population health and social inequalities that contributed to the 1918 pandemic outcomes, taking into account both influenza and other respiratory illnesses that were circulating during the pandemic. Advancing knowledge about how past behaviors and population structure affected previous pandemic outcomes can contribute to contemporary knowledge of human behaviors, population structure, and potential infectious threats. This project will also support science outreach and education activities at the research location and home institution.

The investigators will analyze the impact of population heterogeneity, specifically in terms of social inequalities, on mortality associated with four respiratory diseases (influenza, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and bronchitis) during the 1918 influenza pandemic on the island of Newfoundland. Newfoundland represents a unique opportunity for the use of historical archival data to reconstruct the political economy, population, and social structure of a pre-industrial society in a way that is directly comparable to its Western neighbors. Early 20th century Newfoundland's urban and rural regions varied greatly in their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics; therefore, research questions will address how age, sex, gendered divisions of labor, crowding, income, and education facilitate social inequality that leads to differential disease mortality. The data used will be collected from the Provincial Archives of Newfoundland & Labrador, and will include yearly vital statistics, death records, newspapers, diaries, photograph collections, and literature. Survival analysis and seasonal regression models will be used to quantify differential mortality across the island, but qualitative data are also critical to understanding the cultural norms of men, women, and children during the early 20th century, and an anthropological perspective on 1918 pandemic mortality. This project is jointly supported by the NSF's Biological Anthropology and Cultural Anthropology programs.

"This doctoral dissertation project will examine the evolutionary history of gelada monkeys (genus Theropithecus) based on skeletal and genetic data. Species of this group occur more broadly and in larger numbers than any other non-human primate in the fossil record of Africa. Fossils have been found in southern, eastern, and northern Africa, the Middle East, Spain, and even India, an unusual distribution for any primate group besides humans. The living representatives of this group, however, are only found in the highlands of Ethiopia. Because of their overlap with humans in the past, these monkeys have often been suggested as a model for understanding human evolution. Therefore, the in-depth analysis of gelada monkeys will not just provide better insight into the evolution of this group but will also advance the study of human evolution. This project will support graduate student training, and results from the project will be presented to the general public through the American Museum of Natural History Sackler Educational Laboratory's ""Meet the Scientist"" program.

The main goal of this project is to fully understand the evolutionary relationships, taxonomy and paleobiology of the primate genus Theropithecus. All available cranio-dental data for both living and extinct members of this group will be compiled. Morphometric data in the form of 3D landmarks and 2D measurements, as well as morphological data in the form of character states, will be collected. Genetic data will also be collected, thereby resulting in a large, integrated dataset for this primate group. This comprehensive dataset will then be used to: assess the morphological as well as genetic differences among the living populations of Theropithecus gelada; inform research on fossil populations; provide a comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction of the genus Theropithecus; investigate the dietary trends seen in this genus and their relationship to cranio-dental morphological trends; and investigate the cause of the extreme facial morphology exhibited by some species of this genus and evaluate whether that is related to diet, sexual selection or some other factor. As part of this study a new and relatively unknown population of an extant endemic primate will be analyzed and provide new insights for conservation purposes.

This study will ultimately result in the largest and most complete dataset for this genus and provide a better systematic as well as paleobiological understanding of a primate that is very often used as a model for human evolution. This study will also be one of the first that will utilize and test the phylogenetic morphometrics or landmark analysis under parsimony (LAUP) method in primate phylogenetic studies and provide the groundwork for further use of this method in biological anthropology.

"Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Treponema pallidum subp. pallidum bacteria. It has recently reemerged as an urgent worldwide health crisis. The origin of the disease has been a mystery since its sudden appearance in Europe at the end of the 15th century and its subsequent rapid global spread. It has long been debated whether syphilis was introduced to Europe, perhaps from the Americas, or evolved from a form of treponemal infection that had been in Europe all along.  Graduate student Ziyu Wang and collaborators at The Pennsylvania State University will take a multi-faceted approach to investigate the pathogen's genetic diversity over the past 500 years in Europe to explore several possibilities to explain syphilis' origin in Europe. The current T. pallidum pathogens - associated with several related diseases - likely represent only the most successful or recently emerged genetic variants. Examined through an anthropological lens, ancient genomes when considered within the context of human sociocultural systems yield clues about the processes through which pathogens have achieved their evolutionary success. Ultimately a more informed understanding of the factors that contribute to the complex and dynamic interactions between humans and their pathogens provides a deep-time foundation for predicting the evolutionary trajectories of modern infectious pathogens and human responses. Today, as in the past, STI-related stigma has done much to interfere with the development and implementation of effective intervention programs. Lessons learned from historic epidemics and the public response will provide valuable tools for training healthcare professionals, STI high-risk groups, and the public.

To untangle syphilis' origin, its evolution, and its worldwide spread, the research team will sequence T. pallidum genomes from representative specimens sampled from temporally and socially well-characterized European skeletal assemblages dating to the 16th to 19th centuries. Ancient T. pallidum has previously not been well studied because of the limited ability of conventional genetic techniques (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) to recover highly-degraded ancient pathogen DNA. Here a sensitive targeted hybridization capture technique will be used to recover complete, or near-complete, ancient T. pallidum genomes. By comparing temporally known ancient pathogen genomes with their modern equivalents, the research team can track the sequential changes that occurred in the pathogen's genetic history. Doing so will narrow the possible evolutionary scenarios for the origin of syphilis and point to when the pathogen variant that causes syphilis first emerged.

As a disease of great historical importance, the geographic origin of syphilis, in connection with its first recorded epidemic in Europe in 1495, has been at the center of a centuries-long debate. This was because the outbreak occurred at the beginning of a significant bidirectional exchange of humans, plants, animals, and microbes across the Atlantic. For centuries, the ""Columbian hypothesis"" claims that Columbus's crew introduced syphilis, a previously unknown disease, to Europe upon their return from the Americas in 1493. Alternatively, the pre-Columbian hypothesis argues that syphilis existed in Europe prior to Columbus. There are two nuanced views here, although both of them suggest an African origin for the disease. The first one, the Alternative hypothesis, pointed to the pathogen’s natural reservoirs found in wild non-human primates (NHPs) as a possible source, with the disease introduced to continental Europe through the slave trade prior to 1495. The second perspective (the Unitarian hypothesis) argues that the T. pallidum pathogen is ubiquitous around the globe. The pathogen spread with early Paleolithic human migrations out of Africa. Currently scientific data supporting these various narratives are limited. 

With 20th century medical knowledge, we now know that the precise causative agent of syphilis, TPA, is closely related to other T. pallidum subspecies of pertenue (TPE) and endemicum (TEN) that cause the endemic disease forms of yaws and bejel, respectively. These three diseases are collectively known as the human treponematoses. The pathogen subspecies of each disease form is morphologically and physiologically indistinguishable by microscopy or by serological tests of host antibodies. Healthcare professionals have to predominantly base their diagnoses on a careful consideration of clinical characteristics. However, the clinical manifestations of each disease form are highly variable, yet are strikingly similar to one another. Because of the overlap in clinical signs, diagnosis accuracy is frequently questioned, especially in regions where multiple treponematoses occur. Currently the precise identification of disease form by its responsible pathogen subspecies is only by molecular methods. 

Exactly which and how many forms of treponemal infection existed in Europe is currently unclear in historical documents and the archaeological record. Because syphilis is customarily known to be the only form of treponematosis that transmits sexually, it has been assumed that the bacterium responsible for the 1495 European epidemic is the same as, or has evolved into, TPA, the causative agent of modern syphilis. Although there are, at present, only a few such sequences, further work promises to clarify the evolutionary history of the treponemal diseases through a combination of ‘lost"" ancient T. pallidum genomes and paleopathological evidence.

To retrieve historical European T. pallidum genomes, we identified skeletal individuals with bony lesions consistent with the treponematoses in three large and well-characterized Danish archaeological skeletal assemblages: 1) Lindegarden, Ribe; (n=215; AD 1427-1805); 2) Gr&aring;br&oslash;dre, Svendborg (n=200; AD 1500-1600); and 3) Klosterkirken, Horsens (n= 221; AD 1750-1856). For a multi-stage paleogenomic study, we sampled teeth from individuals (&ge;15 years old) with (n=39) and without (n=11) skeletal lesions suggestive of treponemal infection. First, we screened metagenomic/shotgun sequences recovered from the teeth of these 50 individuals for genetic signatures of T. pallidum. Then, for 18 samples identified with putative T. pallidum DNA, we used a targeted whole genomic hybridization capture approach to enrich for T. pallidum DNA fragments prior to another round of sequencing. A novel ancient T. pallidum draft genome was identified in individual AG51 from the Gr&aring;br&oslash;dre cemetery in Svendborg, along with 17 samples of low-genome coverage. This newly reconstructed Danish ancient T. pallidum genome is phylogenetically placed within the TPE lineage. This indicates that TPE was an agent of treponematosis that existed in the once-living Danish community. This novel Danish TPE genome is closely related to all historical TPE genomes recovered from human remains dated to the 16th to 18th centuries. Our finding, when added to a growing body of ancient T. pallidum genomics evidence from the early modern Europe, suggests that the documented European ""syphilis"" epidemics starting in 1495, along with its subsequent global spread, might have been causes by multiple T. pallidum lineages, not just TPA. Drawing from multidisciplinary perspectives, we further suggest a complex evolutionary process of T. pallidum with a possible early origin from Africa and multiple dispersion events facilitated by human population movements throughout history.

"Fifty thousand years ago, modern humans dispersing out of Africa to Europe and Asia met now-extinct human relatives, such as Neanderthals, and interbred with them. As a result, genetic variation from Neanderthals exists in the human gene pool, but the effects of this variation on human biology are not well understood. In this doctoral dissertation project, the researcher will conduct a large-scale laboratory-based genetic experiment to test whether Neanderthal variants can affect the degree to which a gene is active in human immune cells. By identifying these variants and making publicly available the raw data from this experiment, the researchers will advance knowledge about the effects of evolutionary history and genetic variation on the immune system of living humans. Given that science news often features stories about Neanderthals, the researchers will utilize popular interest in this area to demonstrate the biological and medical relevance of studying human evolutionary history. They will also work with two museums to develop an exhibit that will additionally highlight the practical importance of this field of research. Furthermore, this project will help promote women in science given that the research will largely be undertaken by a female graduate student who is committed to training other women in science and has been active in the organization for Graduate Women in Science Engineering at her university. 

Although the last two decades have seen great strides in genetic research, because the specific function of most of the human genome is still unknown, researchers face difficulty when trying to connect most specific genetic mutations to their effect on biology. To aid in this discovery, datasets have been produced that allow correlations between the presence of genetic variation and biological phenotypes. However, because genetic variants near each other are often inherited together, it can be difficult to determine which genetic variant is responsible for the biological effect, limiting the ability to truly understand the mechanism. This is especially true in the case of Neanderthal genetic sequences present in living humans, which mostly lay in poorly understood parts of the genome that are thought generally to regulate the expression of genes. Nonetheless, correlational evidence suggests that this Neanderthal genetic variation may be affecting human immune system function. The researchers will conduct an experiment in which they simultaneously test thousands of Neanderthal genetic variants and their human counterparts for their ability to regulate the expression of genes in the immune system, in order to isolate the specific Neanderthal genetic variants that affect the biology of the human immune system. This will allow researchers to focus future work on specific functional testing of these important genetic variants.  Furthermore, by directly comparing correlational findings to the results in a laboratory experiment, this research will deepen the understanding of these commonly used genetic datasets.

This contribution today comprises ~2% of all non-African genomes. While much of this contribution was likely not important to human survival, a portion of it was important to survival and therefore was evolutionarily advantageous. Given that Neanderthals lived in ancient Eurasia about 200,000 years before modern humans entered it, Neanderthals likely acquired genetic adaptations to ancient environmental stressors, especially to specific pathogens that were unique to Europe and Asia. By breeding with these archaic Neanderthal ancestors, modern humans may have acquired DNA variants that helped them adapt to these new pathogens in ancient Eurasia. The human immune system was therefore likely affected by these new introgressed DNA sequences. However, the biological importance and function of this introgressed DNA sequence in present-day human cells remains unknown. Most of the sequences are found in non-coding DNA (regions that do not instruct direct protein building), and therefore it remains unknown what adaptive functional role each sequence served. Without knowing the function of this DNA, its biological consequence and potential adaptive benefit to human survival cannot be fully understood.
 
We approached this task using a series of different computational and functional analyses in the laboratory.  We first used computational methods to identify the DNA sequences in living humans that were introgressed from Neanderthals and have adaptively evolved in our ancestors. By using this approach, we identified approximately 60,000 DNA variants that reflect this ancient adaptive process and are present today in at least one of 20 modern human populations from around the world. This approach therefore allowed us to move away from only concentrating on variants present in Europeans, but to expand to many non-western populations.
 
However, this large number of variants (approximately 60,000) made it difficult and time-consuming to test each one, one-by-one, for some function. As a result, we used a new type of functional screen of these non-coding genetic variants, one that permitted us to test thousands of them for function simultaneously. This screen is called the Multiple Parallel Reporter Assay, and it is based on the premise that because these variants reside in non-coding sequences they likely fall in gene on/off switches that control whether a gene is used to build a protein. This is analogous to an on/off light switch in the house that turns on the light bulb (gene) in one room. The assay then assesses whether each DNA variant resides in and turns on the switch, but it does so by testing thousands at a time. We next tested this assay on approximately 10% of the sequences (5,353 variants). Given the importance of the human immune system for our ancestor's survival, we tested if the Neanderthal introgressed DNA variant altered on/off switch activity in two human immune cell lines (K562 and Jurkats). We identified that about 40% or 2,548 DNA variants do indeed reside in on/off switches. Moreover, we reduced the list of 5,353 to just 292 variants that then substantially modulate gene expression.
 
This work represents the first high-throughput screen directly targeted at Neanderthal introgressed DNA variants and reveals a set of identified (292) variants that can then be further examined for functionality in human cells and/or in vivo systems.  To then get a bit at direct function, we then used a form of DNA modification (called CRISPR-Cas9 editing) to remove a few of these variants from the genomes of human immune cells (in vitro) to see how they impact cell biology and gene expression. Overall, our findings provide substantial evidence that these 292 variants are important immune DNA on/off switches, and may be responsible for how human ancestors survived ancient pathogens in the new environments they entered upon leaving Africa. In addition, we pin-pointed several DNA variants acting as on/off switch modulators in a large DNA region that has been identified as being protective for COVID-19 illness. We also then found several DNA variants acting as on/off switch modulators in another large DNA region that has been identified as being a major risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness.
 
In the context of this investigation, our studies provided direct training for a female STEM scientist in human biology and computational biology. They also fostered the training of undergraduates in the tools of molecular biology and computational biology. These studies are currently being reviewed for publication in refereed journals, and the data will be used by immunologists and geneticists to help understand how DNA sequences aid in human survival. These data will also be incorporated into several museum exhibits to foster the understanding of human evolution, and how DNA sequences control human traits, including those involved in our ability to fight diseases.

The project will advance knowledge about hip and shoulder developmental genetics in the context of modern human skeletal evolution. The project will support graduate research and training; 1-2 undergraduates also will have the opportunity to gain lab experience. The co-PI will use her work in a Life Science Outreach program at Harvard University as an opportunity to discuss this research and other facets of human evolution and genetics with New England high school biology teachers and students, ideally recruiting interested students to visit the lab and serve as summer researchers. The PI and co-PI's close ties with the Harvard Museum of Natural History will allow for the development of public exhibits and events that showcase bone biology, genetics, and human evolution.

Researchers have discussed a number of evolutionary pressures, primarily related to the adoption of bipedalism, that are likely to have acted on pelvis and scapula morphology during hominin evolution. However, little is known about underlying genomic mechanisms that resulted in the observed changes in the shape and structure of these bones. This project will investigate portions of the genome that were previously identified as having potential activity and regulatory functions during embryonic pelvis and scapula development. The genomic sequences being specifically investigated overlap with regions of DNA that show signs of having been under positive selection in the human lineage. For each of these regulatory sequences, the researchers will test whether the human and chimpanzee versions of the sequence control gene activity, and whether there are differences in gene activity between the two species. This work will help to identify sequences likely to have been under selection during human evolution to produce the modern human pelvis and scapula.

"This doctoral dissertation project will use comparative and biocultural approaches to better understand how body phenotypes are understood in the US cultural context, and how these cultural understandings may contribute to biological disparities among adolescents. The investigators will measure allostatic load (a measure of low-level chronic stress) in two groups of adolescents to assess biological impacts of psychosocial stress from perceived weight stigma in various epidemiological contexts. The work will address complex relationships among phenotypic norms, social stigma, and co-morbidities of obesity in a vulnerable section of the US population, at a time when there is a high prevalence of obesity, perceived weight stigma, and weight discrimination. Research findings will be shared with study participants as well as curriculum specialists to develop new learning modules. The project supports graduate training for a female, first-generation college student. 

This research employs a mixed-methods, sequential explanatory strategy, using questionnaires, biomarkers, and ethnographic interviews to compare two populations varying in prevalence of obesity: Lawrence County, Indiana (38%) and Monroe County, Indiana (22%). The project is framed around the concept of biological normalcy, which refers to the ways in which human societies develop understandings of what a ""normal"" human body is - normal referring to normative ideas about what bodies ""should"" be as well as statistical distributions of different phenotypic traits. The researchers use this concept to address: 1) how cultural beliefs about what constitutes a ""normal"" or healthy body are related to statistical biological norms (i.e. obesity prevalence) within a population, and 2) how these normative beliefs influence the statistical distribution of biological traits (i.e. allostatic load) in a population. It is hypothesized that variation in obesity prevalence observed between the two field sites in Indiana will be associated with differences in perceived weight stigma, with those reporting higher perceived stigma also having higher allostatic load, and that this relationship will be moderated by several social and behavioral factors and coping strategies.

The project was framed around the concept of Biological Normalcy, which refers to the ways in which human societies develop understandings of what a ""normal"" human body is - normal referring to normative ideas about what bodies ""should"" be as well as statistical distributions of different phenotypic traits. More specifically, this research addressed how cultural beliefs about what constitutes a ""normal"" or healthy body weight are related to statistical biological norms within a population (i.e. obesity prevalence), and how these normative beliefs can influence the statistical distribution of biological health outcomes in a population.

This project encompassed two phases and employed a mixed-methods, sequential explanatory strategy, using questionnaires, biomarkers, and ethnographic interviews. The first phase assessed the relationships between perceptions of average body weight, healthy body weight, and weight status among 137 adolescents (March 2019 &ndash; October 2019). Eleven of these participants also participated in semi-structured interviews where they provided descriptions of what they thought were ""average,"" ""healthy,"" and ""normal"" body weights. Qualitative and quantitative data both indicated that perceived body weight norms were associated with normative perceptions around what healthy bodies look like, but this relationship was complicated by perceived weight status. Additionally, perceived weight status appears to play a role in adolescents’ conceptualizations of healthy body weight.

In the second phase, it was hypothesized that variation in obesity prevalence observed in different regions of the state of Indiana would be associated with differences in perceived weight stigma, with those reporting higher perceived stigma also having higher allostatic load (a measure of low-level chronic stress), and that this relationship would be moderated by several social and behavioral factors and coping strategies. To test these hypotheses, perceived weight stigma and allostatic load (measured using blood pressure, pulse rate, c-reactive protein, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HbA1c, and triglycerides) were evaluated in 175 late adolescents/young adults (aged 18-22) from different regions of the state of Indiana varying by adult obesity prevalence to assess biological impacts of psychosocial stress from perceived weight stigma in variable epidemiological contexts (March 2019 &ndash; March 2020). Semi-structured interviews were conducted virtually with 53 of these participants in June 2020. Other measures included height, weight, body fat percentage, emotional support, and use of different coping strategies.

Preliminary data analysis indicates that obesity prevalence did not predict perceived weight stigma. That said, higher perceived fat stigma was associated with higher allostatic load, even after controlling for body composition, and this relationship was significantly moderated by obesity prevalence, wherein the most vulnerable individuals appeared to be those experiencing high levels of weight-based stigma in populations where obesity is relatively less common. Further quantitative and qualitative data analyses still need to be conducted to see if differences in emotional support or coping strategies might contribute to the observed variation in the relationship between perceived weight stigma and allostatic load across different levels of obesity prevalence in this sample.

Results from the first phase have been submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and are currently under review. The co-PI presented the preliminary results from the second phase at the 46th Annual Meeting of the Human Biology Association on March 29, 2021 as well as in the official podcast of the Human Biology Association (The Sausage of Science, episode 120). Additional products from this project beyond these preliminary results will be distributed in presentations and publications in scientific journals in the future.

This work assessed complex relationships among phenotypic norms, social stigma, and co-morbidities of obesity in a vulnerable section of the US population, at a time when there is a high prevalence of obesity, perceived weight stigma, and weight discrimination. Furthermore, this research is the first to demonstrate a significant association between perceived weight stigma and allostatic load among late adolescents/early young adults. Research findings will be shared with study participants as well as curriculum specialists to develop new learning modules in the future. This project supported graduate training for a female, first-generation college student, and the co-PI mentored several female STEM undergraduate students from Indiana University who assisted during data collection and data entry. These students received training in bioethics, anthropometrics, blood sampling, data entry, and interview transcription.

"Primates engage in a complex array of behavioral strategies during social interactions. This doctoral dissertation project will study the relative importance of friendly and aggressive behaviors and the broader contexts in which these behaviors occur during male-female interactions. The project will contribute to our understanding of the distribution of reproductive behaviors observed across the Primate Order. This project will contribute to the training of an undergraduate student in hormonal analysis techniques in the laboratory. The project will also contribute to conservation education programs and classroom connections between research site locations and the home institution. 

Olive baboons provide a unique opportunity to test several hypotheses addressing the expression of coercive versus ""friendly"" interactions with respect to mating.  Because mating opportunities for males in this species are not strictly confined to the highest ranking individuals, both aggressive and friendly approaches occur, either by different males or even by the same males at different times, with different mates.  However, the conditions influencing the relevant male and female mating decisions generating these patterns are currently unclear. Systematic behavioral and hormonal data will be collected from wild olive baboons to test whether two recognized aggressive tactics are effective male strategies in either the long-term or the short-term. Correspondingly, this research will evaluate whether males obtain mating opportunities through the contrasting strategy of friendly interaction to females, either as part of a long-term strategy of positive social affiliation or as a short-term tactic. This project also will record female injuries and non-invasively measure stress hormones to evaluate the physiological response and potential costs to females of male strategies. This primate system provides a useful model for testing general principles of how these ostensibly antithetical strategy sets interact co-evolutionarily.

"Scalp hair in the absence of body hair is a uniquely human trait, whose evolutionary significance is not well understood. This doctoral dissertation project will develop a digital tool for the quantitative measurement of hair fiber morphology, to investigate the underlying genetic architecture of hair morphology across human groups, and experimentally test the function of scalp hair as a barrier to solar heat gain. The methods developed as part of this project will advance our understanding of human adaptive traits and also inform forensic and dermatological research. Data collected for this project will increase the representation of understudied groups in research. This project will provide valuable research opportunities for undergraduates from groups underrepresented in STEM research fields and will generate materials for teaching about human biological diversity in a non-racial paradigm.

Human hair morphology varies on a continuous spectrum from straight to tightly curled; however, research in genetics, dermatology, and forensics incudes a range of descriptors that can be qualitative (e.g. wavy, frizzy) and racial (e.g. 'Caucasian hair,' 'African-type hair'). By developing a method to quantify hair morphology and studying the genetic variation in a diverse group of African Americans, this study leverages genetic admixture as a means of elucidating genotypes underlying hair morphology across human groups. The experimental work in this project will test the hypothesis that human scalp hair morphology evolved in early Homo as a protective mechanism against heat gain from solar radiation. This project will additionally carry out a series of tests of selection on candidate loci (previously associated with hair morphology or hair follicle development) to test whether there is evidence of selection in hair-related genes that would support a thermoregulatory explanation for the evolution of human scalp hair.

Lasisi successfully developed and released a Python package that allows for the automated analysis of both cross-sectional and longitudinal hair fiber images. Additionally, she has develop laboratory protocols for the preparations of cross-sectional and longitudinal (curvature) hair samples. Both the protocols and image analysis package are freely available and can be found through the project website (here) as well as the open-access publication on the methods (here). 
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, participant recruitment for the genetic research component could not be carried out as planned. However, Lasisi is using her newly developed hair phenotyping methods to analyze previously collected hair samples and plans to push this research forward as sampling becomes feasible again. Preliminary results on the potential for discovering new hair-related genetic loci are presented in the methods paper (here). 
Lastly, Lasisi carried out a novel experimental study on the effect of scalp hair morphology on heat transfer. Her results demonstrated that the presence of scalp hair significantly reduces heat gained from solar radiation and that tightly curled hair, in particular, minimizes heat gain from solar radiation. 
Results discussed in this report can be found in Lasisi’s doctoral dissertation which is freely available (here).  
 
The research funded by this grant has allowed Lasisi to produce novel research on an aspect of human biological variation that has historically been racialized and that remains poorly understood. This work has formed the basis of many of Lasisi’s science communication efforts and she continues to share her research and knowledge of human evolutionary biology through various public and social media outlets.

"Language is a trait that sets humans apart from all other species, and researchers are interested in understanding how, when, and why complex language evolved in hominins. This doctoral dissertation project will use a non-human model to understand neuro-genetic changes that correlate with increased social learning and flexibility of vocal behavior. These data will be compared with human and chimpanzee genomic data to identify potential shared evolutionary mechanisms in the evolution of birdsong and human language. By illuminating the molecular mechanisms of auditory perception that support learning of a more flexible vocal behavior in the model system, the research may shed light on our understanding of normal functionality and disorders of human speech. The project will also include public and K-12 science outreach activities in the San Francisco Bay Area.

This project will empirically investigate the genetic and evolutionary processes that correlate with increased flexibility of vocal learning and behavior in the White-Backed Munia (WBM)/Bengalese Finch (BF) songbird system. The researchers will then investigate potentially analogous genetic and functional pathways involved in the evolution of flexible human vocal learning capacities with respect to those of other primates. Specific aims of the project include: (i) an investigation of the evolutionary forces underlying the changes in vocal behavior in BF relative to WBM utilizing whole-genome sequencing of individuals within the two bird strains and subsequent scans for signatures of positive or relaxed selection, thus allowing identification of candidate genes modified in this transition; (ii) an analysis of genetically regulated differences in neurological function correlated with differences in the flexibility of adult vocal production between BF and WBM, by comparing measures of gene expression for whole transcriptomes from main birdsong-related brain areas of BF and WBM adult males exposed to unfamiliar conspecific song; and (iii) a comparison of the birdsong data to neuroanatomical and genomic data provided by studies of human divergence from closely related primates (e.g. chimpanzee) to identify possible evolutionary parallelisms.",NSF,University of California-Los Angeles,CA,28104,1913821,sawhite@ucla.edu,Stephanie,White,0,03/08/2019,03/01/2019,07/31/2020,Doctoral Dissertation Research: A model system for understanding the evolution of human language,"['Caitlin Aamodt, Madza Farias-Virgens and Stephanie A White~Birdsong as a window into language origins and evolutionary neuroscience~Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society B Biological Sciences~~2020~~~10.1098/rstb.2019.0060~0~ ~0~ ~07/04/2021 16:14:06.430000000', 'Caitlin M.

However, many necessary components of spoken language are shared with communicative behaviors found in other species. Among these enabling blocks, there is the ability to learn to produce vocal sounds via imitation, in addition to associating innate sounds with external events or objects. Though quite rare and rudimentary among mammals, vocal production learning is a prominent trait in songbirds. Our research integrates tools from population genomics and brain transcriptomics to identify genes and biological pathways of importance for functional aspects of vocal production learning in the Bengalese finch, a domesticated songbird, frequently found in pet shops, but also a popular animal model in the study of learned vocal behaviors. Among songbird model species, the Bengalese finch draws special attention due to its less predictable ordering of vocal units composing a song, and its ability to learn from multiple tutors presented simultaneously. This vocal complexity evolved during the Bengalese finch?s domestication from white-backed munias, and it is greater than shown by other popular songbird model species, such as zebra finches. We have found several genomic areas with high differentiation between Bengalese finches and their munia ancestors, including multiple components of the dopamine system, a biopathway fundamental to vocal learning. Bengalese finches also show reduced genome-wide levels of variability, and evidence for the purging of changes potentially highly deleterious in captivity. We are simultaneously determining transcriptomic signatures in song-dedicated brain regions of juvenile, which are actively engaged in song learning, and adult male BFs, which have passed this learning phase and are instead engaged in song maintenance and performance. Currently, the BF/WBM system is the best characterized case of a within-lineage transition to a more complex pattern of production vocal learning, and both ancestor and descendant lineages are amenable for controlled experimental scientific investigation. Results from this work have the potential to guide further comparative efforts toward identifying analogous genes and biological pathways in our own species.

"Vitamin D is vital to the function of several organs and tissues, with decreased vitamin D levels hypothesized to be a contributing factor in several disease processes. Populations in higher latitudes are more likely to have vitamin D deficiencies due to lack of sun exposure; however, recent research indicates that vitamin D deficiency has become a global phenomenon, even in countries near the equator, with women often experiencing more severe deficiency. This doctoral dissertation project applies a biocultural perspective on vitamin D production from infancy through young adulthood to investigate how societal practices and norms create and dictate the physical environments that individuals experience. By using a longitudinal data set, the study delves deeper into the possible factors that contribute to vitamin D deficiency in both men and women, and for societies undergoing urbanization. The project not only addresses the complex interplay of human biology and culture, but also has the potential to inform public health efforts to understand and address vitamin D deficiency.  

Biological anthropology has elaborated the tradeoffs between the need for vitamin D production and the need to avoid damage from the harmful effects of exposure to ultraviolet rays, but unanswered questions remain regarding how vitamin D is regulated and why some individuals are at risk for vitamin D deficiency.  The primary focus has been on sun exposure, but other aspects of the current environment, and aspects of the environment experienced early in life, may be equally important.  This study will use longitudinal data collected from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey in the Philippines to assess the effects of rapid urbanization and socioeconomic change on vitamin D production in young adulthood.  A range of environmental factors early in development, and in adulthood, will be tested as predictors of circulating vitamin D.  Furthermore, DNA methylation - an epigenetic process that is associated with gene expression - will be measured at sites in genes associated with vitamin D production.  DNA methylation is a plausible mechanism through which environments during development can regulate genome activity in adulthood, and the study will investigate the association between environments in childhood, DNA methylation of vitamin D genes, and vitamin D production in adulthood. The use of a biocultural anthropological approach allows for an exploration of how lived experience affects vitamin D production and well-being over the life course.

Populations in higher latitudes are more likely to have vitamin D deficiencies due to lack of sun exposure; however, recent research indicates that vitamin D deficiency has become a global phenomenon, even in countries near the equator with women often experiencing more severe deficiency.  Therefore, it is critical to understand what contexts and behaviors, in adulthood and during development, influence levels of vitamin D production. This project applies a anthropological perspective on vitamin D production from infancy through young adulthood to illustrate how societal practices and norms create and dictate the physical environments that individuals experience. By using a longitudinal data set, the study delves deeper into the possible factors that contribute to vitamin D deficiency during the life couse for both men and women in societies undergoing urbanization, which is vital to understanding the long-term health consequences of vitamin D regulation.  

This study uses longitudinal data collected from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey in the Philippines to assess the effects of rapid urbanization and socio-economic change on vitamin D production in young adulthood.  A range of environmental factors early in development, and in adulthood, were tested as predictors of circulating vitamin D.  Furthermore, DNA methylation&mdash;an epigenetic process that is associated with gene expression&mdash;was measured at sites in genes associated with vitamin D production.  DNA methylation is a plausible mechanism through which environments during development can regulate genome activity in adulthood, and the study will investigate the association between environments in childhood, DNA methylation of vitamin D genes, and vitamin D production in adulthood. 

Overall, vitamin D in this population differed between females and males, with males more likely to have higher 25(OH) vitamin D measurements than females. Additionally, females were more likely to be categorized as deficient (&lt; 20ng.mL) or insufficient (&lt; 30 ng/mL) with regards to their vitamin D status as compared to males, and almost 75% of the sample was not able to meet their vitamin D requirements. Furthermore, females were more likely to have greater adiposity and less physical activity than their male counterparts. Here, research indicates that the measure of adiposity requires the more nuanced and rigorous measurement of collecting skinfold thickness. Researchers emphasized the need to control for adiposity by using BMI. However, the research results on body composition and vitamin D indicate that BMI is not the best control for adiposity in this population. Skinfold thickness is a much better measure of adiposity.

For adulthood environment, no major differences were found between the female and male groups. The only significant predictor for males in adulthood was fish consumption, and no significant factors were found for females. However, fish consumption may have a gendered compoenent that indicates why male fish consumption positively predicts vitamin D. Fishing is traditionally a male occupation, which may indicate that female exclusion is also impacting vitamin D levels. Furthermore, methylation was not found to signficantly predict vitamin D production indicating that vitamin D production may be more sensitive to environments in adulthood. 

Broader impacts include the generation of knowledge that may improve public health.  Because many communicable and non-communicable diseases are associated with vitamin D deficiency, understanding the developmental and ecological determinants of circulating serum vitamin D is vital to understanding the links between vitamin D deficiency and disease.  In addition, the project contributed to diversifying the infrastructure of science by supporting a PhD project led by a student from a group historically under-represented in science.

"This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the relationship between physiology and behavior when humans are exposed to novel, challenging environments. The project will draw upon core bodies of research on biological plasticity and adaptation, energy allocation and expenditure, and social cooperation. This research will facilitate new insights on how humans acclimate to extreme cold and high altitude demands, which will broadly inform research on human capacities to respond to the diverse range of ecological stressors found throughout the world. This study will help train a woman of color at the University of Notre Dame for her PhD and will also help in the training of undergraduate and junior graduate students in the Hormones, Health, & Human Behavior Lab, of which ~80% of lab members are women and underrepresented minority students. In conjunction with the National Outdoor Leadership School, the investigator has created a project website that both students and the public can easily access for preliminary findings and updates on the study. The research team has also heavily engaged in public outreach, including presentations for elementary and middle school classes, public lectures to local communities, and promoting scientific inquiry and sharing research through popular science articles, podcasts, and social media venues like Twitter.

This project aims to help understand how humans biologically and behaviorally acclimate to novel and challenging ecologies, specifically via the relationships between energetic/metabolic physiology, neuroendocrine systems, and social dynamics. The investigator will study individuals participating in ~90 day expeditions through the American Rockies as a part of the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). In such environments (e.g. high altitude or cold), ecological and psychological stressors impose intensive demands on human physiology, including metabolic and psychobiological functioning. The research will address larger discussions about (i) biological variation, plasticity, and adaptation in challenging ecologies, (ii) life history- and ecological-based perspectives on energetic allocation and expenditure, and (iii) the evolution and function of prosociality, cooperation, and collective action. Recognizing the relationship and nuances between physiology and behavior may give critical insight into the success of human global expansion and settlement, with implications for human health and well-being as well as future exploration, and habitation of increasingly changing and unique ecologies.

Specifically, this project assessed how body composition, hormones, and energetic physiology (n = 71) changed over the 3-month period as well as the relationship between changes in hormones and how people spent energy. Additionally, this project assessed how processes related to social dynamics, such as perceptions of stress and resilience, related to individual physiology, particularly hormone and energetic systems. The findings from this work provided critical insights into how individuals successfully cope with the high-energy demands of new and difficult environments.

The intellectual merit of this project is that it addresses how processes related to social and interpersonal dynamics influence individual hormonal and energetic physiology under challenging ecological conditions. These are theoretically important processes that are relevant to contemporary human experience, including everyday functioning in an extreme environment, and that are potentially relevant to periodic demands placed on past human populations. In addition, this project brings innovative and integrative perspectives measuring different and interrelated physiological and behavioral systems repeatedly over time, which can inform our understanding of the timescale over which these complex changes occur as humans accommodate the pertinent environmental and social stressors. Our findings from this research demonstrate that body weight and lean muscle declined when individuals first began the expedition but were able to rebound by the end of the three-month period. We also found that in a highly demanding yet tightly controlled setting like the NOLS course, individual perceptions of lower stress and greater resilience during the expeditions predicted lower cortisol production, which may have had downstream impacts on health and performance. Further, we found that greater resilience predicted greater energy expenditure, on average, suggesting that resilient individuals worked harder and spent more energy. These findings have important implications for positive-perception building in small teams engaged in challenging environments. 

This project has translatable, applied implications that can influence small groups engaging in similarly challenging environments, such as soldiers, aid-workers, and even astronauts, by anticipating changes to the body during acclimatization and identifying what factors are most important in buffering the physiological stress response. The broader impacts of this work also include contributing to the infrastructure of science and education through training of a graduate student, co-PI (Sarma), who is a woman of color, as well as the training and mentorship of three undergraduate women, who were each the lead authors of scientific abstracts at a professional academic conference. Further, this work contributes to public science outreach, advancing education and informing issues of broader societal importance. Every participant was given an outline of preliminary findings specific to them upon completion of the course and the research team is working on developing a project website to relay relevant information back to stakeholders. Throughout this project, Sarma has been invited to give nine talks about her research, ranging from public lectures about this project and related science with local communities to K-12 science outreach. Additionally, Sarma has been a guest on three podcasts to speak about this project and has been cited as an expert in local and international news outlets. This kind of outreach and science communication has advanced the public's understanding about how humans accommodate to extreme environments through changes to their body and behavior.

From this project, we have created a database assessing within-individual change across multiple dimensions over the length of a 3-month long expedition with data derived from saliva samples, activity monitoring, heart-rate monitoring, and surveys; the de-identified data collected will be eventually placed in a publicly accessible repository. We plan to publish the findings from this project in peer-reviewed publications and have three papers in progress. We aim to continue to share the project outcomes and implications with the public.

"Humans have lightly built skeletons compared to both non-human primates and extinct human ancestors. Most research on human skeletal variation has focused on comparing bone structure among geographically, genetically, and behaviorally diverse human groups. In order to understand the influence of behavior and mobility on human bone structure, this doctoral dissertation project will quantify skeletal variation among human groups that are genetically and geographically similar, but behaviorally distinct. This research integrates archaeological evidence of human behavior and microcomputed tomography data to investigate bone structure as an intersection between behavior and biology. Low bone mass related health complications are a prominent expense within the U.S. healthcare system; this project will provide insights into the factors that may contribute to the risk of low bone mass related health issues from an anthropological perspective. The project will also contribute to the development educator workshops for using publicly available 3D image data for classroom-based research projects. 

Recent work has found that human groups with higher levels of activity tend to have more robust cortical and trabecular bone structure compared to groups with relatively lower activity levels. However, much of this research has relied on comparing geographically and genetically distinct human groups. This project investigates the relationship between cortical and trabecular bone structural variation across several post-cranial elements within and between human groups that are genetically and geographically similar, but behaviorally distinct in order to test whether the relationship between behavior and bone structure is maintained, or if other factors such as diet, genetic background, and environment play a larger role in forming adult skeletal phenotype than previously considered. Microcomputed tomography scan data of the humerus, cervical vertebra, femur, tibia, talus, and calcaneus will be collected. Cortical and trabecular bone structural variation will be quantified and compared between groups with different subsistence strategies including foragers, horticulturalists, and intensive agriculturalists. Additionally, the amount of variation in cortical and trabecular bone will be investigated within and between both individuals and skeletal elements in order to understand how different levels of bone structural organization respond to variation in subsistence strategy and mechanical loading.

Previous research has suggested that reduced skeletal robusticity in modern humans coincides with the adoption of agriculture, and the reduction in mobility and activity that was likely associated. Most research has focused on comparing bone structure among geographically, genetically, and behaviorally distinct human groups within the context of changes in food acquisition strategies and activity patterns. However, this approach does not consider other factors known to influence bone structure, including genetics and environmental context. The goal of this project was to complement previous research by investigating how behavior (activity + mobility + diet) influences variation in bone structure between human groups, which, based on archaeological evidence were environmentally and genetically similar, but behaviorally distinct. High-resolution microcomputed tomography image data and advanced bone analysis methods were used to quantify and compare bone structure variation between groups. In general, results indicate that the human group interpreted as being the most physically active (hunter-gatherers) also had the most robust bone structure and the group interpreted as being relatively less active (agriculturalists) had less robust bone structure. The group with intermediate activity level also had intermediate bone robusticity. These findings are consistent with Bone Functional Adaptation, where increased biomechanical loading on bone elicits a biological response that results in more bone material being laid down. Integrating archaeological evidence of human behavior, microCT imaging and visualization, and quantification of bone structure to investigate the relationship between activity and human skeletal structure allows for better control of factors besides activity that are known to influence bone structure, such as environment and genetic ancestry, relative to previous studies. The results provide insight into the effects of variation in subsistence strategy, mobility, and physical activity on human skeletal structure and help strengthen interpretations of living and fossil human behavior in the past.

Beyond investigating variation in human bone structure, another important aspect of this project was to engage with K-12 educators and provide the knowledge and resources necessary to offer their students classroom research experiences. Two five-day educator workshops were developed in collaboration with the Penn State Center for Science and the Schools and the Penn State Functional and Evolutionary Morphology Research Lab and took place in July 2019 and July 2021. During the workshops, participants gained experience and perspective on how to use evidence to interpret and draw conclusions based on morphological data by exploring evolutionary and functional morphology of primates, considering biomechanical explanations for why skeletal traits differ within and between species, collecting and analyzing morphological data using 3D models of bones, learning to use online scientific software, and developing skills to visualize and interpret data using online resources. At the end of the week, educators presented outlines for research projects they would conduct with their students in the coming school years.

"Humans vary in body size and proportions, and the underlying drivers of this variation are not fully understood. Differences in body form can be adaptive for certain environments, such as assisting in thermoregulation of the body through the dissipation or retention of heat, but can also be related to factors such as genetic drift and population history.  This doctoral dissertation research will examine human skeletal variation to understand the impact of various environmental factors on human body form across a wide geographical range.  The project will help to elucidate how environmental factors may have complex, differential effects in males versus females and across different parts of the skeleton. Skeletal data from the project will be compiled into a freely accessible online database. The addition of data for groups and regions of the world that are currently underrepresented in biological and forensic studies will increase understanding of human variation and global diversity.  The project will also foster international research collaborations and student training at the undergraduate and graduate levels. 

Asia has diverse climates, high population densities, and a long history of human habitation.  Using a multidisciplinary methodological approach, this study of Asian populations will meaningfully quantify proportional differences resulting from environmental variables in a way not possible with previous ecogeographic methods.  Standard skeletal measurements and landmarks will be collected to allow for comparisons across geographic regions as well as further examination of variation in the size and shape of the face, cranial vault, and birth canal between the sexes and populations. The analyses will account for the potential influence of nonadaptive forces such as drift and migration on body form by pairing skeletal measurements with appropriately matched genetic data and local weather station information for statistical analysis.  Linear mixed effects models testing for evidence of adaptation due to environmental factors will contain both head and body data of male and female individuals from each population.  Differences in the size and shape of the pelvis between the sexes along with population differences in pelvic morphology will be evaluated using Procrustes fit and principal components analyses as well as size and shape dimorphism indices.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Missouri-Columbia,MO,23814,1847486,cowgilll@missouri.edu,Libby,Cowgill,1,03/05/2019,03/01/2019,02/28/2022,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Influence of environment and population structure on human skeletal variation,,"Funding of this project by NSF allowed for Elizabeth Cho to travel to seven countries in Asia to amass a sample size of 957 individuals originating from 11 different populations for her dissertation research.  At each research location, skeletal measurements were taken on bones of the limbs, hands, and feet and three-dimensional landmark data gathered on the skull and articulated pelvis.  Osteological data was then combined with appropriately matched climate and autosomal genetic data for analysis to discern trends in human adaptation to climate in Asia while considering the potential influences of shared population history and sexual dimorphism.

Postcranial measurements were found to be more influenced by minimum temperature than those of the skull.  However, this association was not found in the hands or feet which suggests that cultural buffering or functional constraints on covarying traits may be muting any adaptive pressure placed on these most distal body parts.  While the sexes often exhibited the same pattern of association with climate, they did not always respond with the same intensity.  These findings support differences in environmental sensitivity between the sexes.  Overall, East Asians increased in overall size and body mass with decreased temperature and decreased in overall size and body mass with increased temperature.  Population dimorphism analyses support a correlation between body mass and temperature, as expected based on Bergmann’s rule.  Despite identifying shared trends of the most and least dimorphic traits of the cranium and pelvis across populations, the level of dimorphism within populations did not exhibit gradual variation in a single direction when associated with climate.

Intellectual merit: The results of this project have been disseminated at national anthropology conferences (earning a student prize for most outstanding presentation on bones), via a podcast episode to a general audience, as part of a university research seminar series, and at the successful defense of the Co-PI’s dissertation.  The inclusion of shape and measurement data throughout the body allowed for the holistic assessment of adaptive trends within the same individual, something that has been lacking in a number of past ecogeographic studies solely centered on the skull or postcrania.  This work also improves understanding of global diversity through representation of a geographic region that has been largely absent in studies of human variation, adaptation, and evolution.

Broader impacts: This research has created the largest East Asian dataset of cranial and postcranial skeletal measurements and shape data to date.  Each population has male and female samples of roughly similar size, which not only better represents skeletal variation of each population within the geographical region but provides a much-needed increase in female representation for morphological and ecogeographic studies.  During data collection, students and professionals at several Asian universities were taught how to gather and analyze three-dimensional landmark data so that they can utilize this approach in their own future research.  International travel and the presentation of project findings has assisted in the building of future research collaborations (domestically and internationally), professional development of the Co-PI, and led to an early career opportunity testing thermoregulatory principles in an effort to link anatomical variation and physiology to the skeletal structure of living individuals.

"Old World monkeys are the most geographically widespread and ecologically diverse group of living primates, with a wide range of diets made possible by the combination of their gut adaptations and the unique shape of their molar teeth. Old World monkeys acquired ""bilophodont"" molars, with cusps united into two pairs of wedges, soon after diverging from a last common ancestor with apes. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the functional significance of this shift in molar form, drawing upon, and contributing to, a framework that considers how dental wear alters the shape and function of teeth throughout an organism's life. This project will also provide opportunities for public outreach and undergraduate research engagement, including students traditionally underrepresented in STEM careers. The large number of 3D scans generated by this project will be made publicly available through MorphoSource, where they can have further use for scientific and educational purposes.  

Primates, like all herbivorous mammals, face selective pressures to maintain function of their permanent teeth in the face of tooth wear. This project will use 3D dental topographic methods to measure the shearing and crushing/grinding potential of molars at varying wear stages in a sample of extant and fossil catarrhines (i.e., Old World monkeys, apes, and humans). First, the investigators will establish a baseline of how extant catarrhine molars are altered by macroscopic wear and use phylogenetic comparative methods to test whether diet or tooth morphology has a greater influence on maintenance of shearing function. Second, these methods will be applied to measure the shearing and crushing/grinding potential from molars of Oligocene and Miocene catarrhines. While extant Old World monkeys have two fully developed lophs on their molars, early members of this clade exhibit partial loph development in some molars. The investigators will test whether these early stages of bilophodonty gave stem cercopithecoids greater persistence of certain tooth functions relative to their non-cercopithecoid catarrhine relatives. Ultimately, this project will contribute to our understanding of the functional origins underlying a key adaptation that contributes to the dietary flexibility and evolutionary success of Old World monkeys.

As of June 2020, 907 casts of lower molar rows have been scanned using an Identica Hybrid structured blue-light scanner to create 65&mu;m resolution 3D surface models of these teeth. These models are will be made available to researchers and educations via the online 3D data repository Morphosource following completion of the doctoral dissertation.

The process of creating these 3D surface models of extant catarrhine molars facilitated the training of three undergraduate students, all of whom come from backgrounds underrepresented in STEM fields. These students were given experience in the process of structured blue light scanning, mesh processing, 3D data collection, microCT scan segmentation, and dental topographic methods. This diverse array of skill sets is applicable to a wide range of fields, from biology to geography to design, and will help prepare these students for their chosen career paths.

The aim of this doctoral dissertation project is to understand functional changes associated with the evolution of the unique bilophodont shape of Old World monkey molars. To achieve this aim, this project must first build a framework for understanding how tooth wear changes the function of molars in extant catarrhines with distinct dietary behaviors. Maintenance of shearing surfaces with progressive tooth wear has been proposed to be an adaptation among folivorous and gramnivorous primates, but a link between dietary toughness and shearing maintenance has not yet been established in catarrhines. As data processing is ongoing, only preliminary analyses have been conducted. However, these initial results suggest that there are differences in the degree to which molar shearing function is altered with tooth wear in extant Old World monkeys, but these differences are not patterned along dietary categories. Maintenance of shearing function occurs in at least one primarily frugivorous species. These results suggest the relationship between shearing maintenance and diet may not be straightforward in Old World monkeys, potentially limiting the ability to draw inferences about fossil Old World monkey diets based on these methods.

"Modern humans have dispersed and settled nearly every region on the planet. The complex timing, movements, and interactions of populations, cultures, and technology in the past are an important part of our human story. This doctoral dissertation project combines genetic and geochemical analyses of human skeletal material from the Chelechol ra Orrak site in Palau, western Micronesia, to investigate prehistoric colonization of an island setting during one of the most widespread and rapid dispersals in human history. Despite this being the last major geographical region to be colonized by humans, information regarding the timing, direction, and origins of settlement in many respects remains unclear. This research will also make broader contributions to local, national, and global communities through undergraduate training and mentorship at the University of Oregon; community involvement and outreach through public talks and the distribution of comics about aDNA in archaeology in Palau; and the implementation of a learning module that teaches the scientific method, archaeological fieldwork, and genetic techniques to underrepresented elementary and middle school students in Oregon.

The investigators will analyze human ancient DNA (aDNA) and geochemical mobility data for Micronesia and provide critical baseline information for future isotopic and genetic research in the region. The objective of this research is to investigate the origins of prehistoric Palauans on a regional scale and subsequent local human mobility within the archipelago following settlement. While linguistic, computer modeling, and biodistance studies have resulted in hypotheses identifying broad general regions of Micronesian population origins, numerous questions regarding the relationship of early Micronesians to other regional populations, and a more specific area of origin still remain. In generating aDNA data for western Micronesia, this project will place early Palauans in a regional framework to examine broader scale genetic relationships. Examination of mobility via strontium (87Sr/ 86Sr) and lead (206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb) isotope analysis from human remains--in conjunction with biological and geological samples taken from locations across the archipelago--will help to identify where individuals buried at Chelechol ra Orrak may have been residing during their lifetime and shed light on inter-island mobility during the earliest phases of settlement in Palau.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Oregon Eugene,OR,24822,1848513,smfitzpa@uoregon.edu,Scott,Fitzpatrick,1,02/26/2019,02/15/2019,01/31/2021,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Genetic and Isotopic Investigations of Human Population Origins and Dispersals in Island Settings,,"Initial human settlement of Remote Oceania represents one of the most rapid and widespread population dispersals in human history. Despite being the most recent major geographical region to be settled by humans, many questions remain regarding the timing of arrival and the origins of Remote Oceania's first inhabitants. This is particularly true in Micronesia, an area of the northwest tropical Pacific, where the coarse nature of available data has prevented researchers from identifying points of origin for early settlers. However, the Chelechol ra Orrak cemetery site, located in Palau, western Micronesia, contains one of the region's largest and oldest human skeletal assemblages and has great potential to fill a number of gaps in our existing knowledge of the earliest Pacific people. In order to address these issues, this project used bioarchaeological methods to investigate 1) the origins of early Palauan people on a regional scale and, 2) local human mobility within the Palauan archipelago following initial settlement. 

To better understand the timing and distribution of early migrations to Palau, ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis of skeletal remains from Chelechol ra Orrak was used to test hypotheses related to potential population source regions based on existing archaeological and linguistic evidence. The addition of radiocarbon dates from the same individuals sampled for aDNA was used to account for possible changes in genetic ancestry over time. This was particularly important as Chelechol ra Orrak was utilized for mortuary practice for over 1000 years. To address the second objective related to mobility within the Palauan archipelago, an analysis of strontium and lead isotope ratios from tooth enamel was used to identify where individuals buried at Chelechol ra Orrak may have been residing during their lifetime, as there is no substantive evidence of settlement in this area of Palau during this time. 

Radiocarbon dates demonstrated that the sampled individuals from whom genetic data could be obtained date to between ~2700-1800 BP, with the majority of burials dating to between ~2750-2300 BP. Although aDNA results only reflect a small number of individuals (n=5), some broad conclusions can be made based on the partial and completed mitochondrial genomes produced as a part of this work. When placed in a regional perspective, these results are characteristic of populations originating in Island Southeast Asia, lending biological support to migration models based on previous linguistic and archaeological evidence. Support for genetic connections to New Guinea, which has been proposed as a possible homeland for early Palauans in past research, was noticeably absent. Additionally, there is no evidence for shared maternal ancestry between Palauan and other early Remote Oceanic groups, raising the possibility that two, or possibly three distinct population dispersals from Island Southeast Asia reached Remote Oceania ca. 3000 BP. 

Results from the isotopic analyses have begun to provide some information regarding mobility within the Palauan archipelago. Strontium isotope values were obtained from at least two different molars each for 11 individuals. Low heterogeneity was observed across samples, but three samples representing two individuals fall outside two standard deviations of the average strontium value, which may indicate the presence of some non-local people interred at Chelechol ra Orrak. Together with the aDNA data, these results also provide some insight into the use of Chelechol ra Orrak as a cemetery site. aDNA results suggest that four distinct maternal lineages are represented by the individuals sampled, demonstrating that Chelechol ra Orrak was utilized as a cemetery by multiple maternally unrelated families rather than a single family group. The additional possibility that non-local individuals may also be interred at the site lends further support to the suggestion that the site may have been used for a broader population. 

The project produced the first human ancient DNA (aDNA) and geochemical mobility data for both Palau and western Micronesia and provides critical baseline information to facilitate future comparisons as research utilizing aDNA and isotopic analyses as tools for exploring population relationships and mobility in the region continue to expand. Additionally, this project has made broader contributions to local, national, and global communities through training and mentorship of undergraduate students at the University of Oregon, community involvement in Palau, including the distribution of comics about aDNA and archaeology, and the implementation of a learning module that teaches the scientific method, archaeological fieldwork, and genetic techniques to elementary and middle school students from underrepresented communities in Oregon.

"Human adaptations in diet and metabolism are likely to be linked to other important human traits, like our large, metabolically demanding brains. This doctoral dissertation project will study astrocytes, a type of metabolically important brain cell, to determine their contribution to the unique metabolism of the human brain. This work will further our understanding of evolved metabolic and neurological differences among primates, while providing insight into an understudied, but critical cell type of the brain at the cellular and genetic levels. This project will support the research of a first-generation female college and graduate student, as well as the development of public and K-12 science communication efforts largely focused on demystifying the genome and understanding the societal implications of readily accessible genomic data. 

Previous research has consistently shown enrichment of metabolic function in genes differentially expressed between the brains of several primate species. This proposal will investigate the evolution of gene expression and function in astrocytes, to understand the extent to which this cell type contributes to the unique metabolism of the human brain. The investigators will use established, non-invasive cell culture methods to grow and develop astrocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells of both humans and chimpanzees. These astrocytes will be assayed for differences in gene expression and traits important for metabolic function, such as glucose uptake into the cell.

Although previous work shows significant differences in genes that are turned on or ""expressed"" between the brains of primates, we have yet to fully resolve the contribution of different brain cell types to these changes in brain function. To investigate cell-type specific interspecies differences in brain gene expression, we conducted RNA-Seq on neural progenitor cells (NPCs), neurons, and astrocytes generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from humans and chimpanzees. Interspecies differential expression (DE) analyses revealed that twice as many genes exhibit DE in astrocytes (12.2% of all genes expressed) than neurons (5.8%). Pathway enrichment analyses of catagories of genes determined that astrocytes, rather than neurons, diverged in expression of glucose and lactate transmembrane transport, as well as pyruvate processing and oxidative phosphorylation. These findings suggest that astrocytes may have contributed significantly to the evolution of greater brain glucose metabolism with proximity to humans.

Evolved differences in metabolic investment may be the basis for a number of primate-specific traits or ""phenotypes"", including those that are unique to humans, such as slow reproduction and growth and correspondingly longer lifespan than other placental mammals. Adaptation can act on metabolic phenotypes through alterations to energy budget including reductions of or increases in total energy budget or differential allocation of energy within energy budget.  Our results demonstrate that altered gene expression between species’ astrocytes - an under-studied, but critical brain cell type with known metabolic relevance, provide insight into the metabolic changes that were necessary to support evolution of the human brain.

"This doctoral dissertation study will explore an important aspect of teeth and their role in dietary ecology, by testing the ability of tooth enamel to resist fracture and wear from forces applied during chewing. Tooth enamel from different primate species will be imaged and mechanically tested using methods from materials science engineering to better understand the relationship between the internal structure of teeth and their performance. The results of this study will illustrate the mechanisms that allow teeth to chew tough and hard foods, which may inform research to develop stronger replacements for worn and broken teeth, as well as research to better reconstruct the diet of extinct humans and animals. The study will support graduate student training and the development of undergraduate laboratory coursework that emphasizes the use of concepts from dental biology and anthropology in engineering applications.	

This study will address how the form of enamel contributes to its function in resisting tooth failure. At micro- and nanometer scales, enamel is formed out of many small crystals that are bundled together in complex patterns. These patterns are thought to help teeth resist wear by aligning crystals in a direction where they are strongest in response to abrasion. Additionally, a highly complex pattern of interwoven crystals is believed to help prevent cracks from moving through enamel and leading to a chipped or cracked tooth. This study combines ion beam microscopy to image micro- and nanometer structures of enamel in fine detail, and indentation methods from material science engineering to determine how enamel structures respond when forces are applied. To understand how these structures function in human teeth, the variation in their properties will be compared with those of other closely related species. For this reason, the analytical sample includes teeth from humans and a range of non-human primates including chimpanzees and baboons. Ultimately, this study will strengthen the inferences that can be made when determining diet from fossils in our evolutionary past, and help to illustrate how and why teeth break.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Rutgers University New Brunswick,NJ,15151,1847941,robertsc@scarletmail.rutgers.edu,Robert,Scott,1,02/22/2019,02/15/2019,12/31/2021,Doctoral Dissertation Research: Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Primate Tooth Enamel,,"Teeth represent an important line of evidence in biological anthropology because they interact directly with foods during chewing and because they preserve well in fossil record. This makes teeth invaluable as tools to infer diet and adaptation in our living primate relatives and fossil ancestor. The goal of this project was to examine signals of dietary adaptation in the enamel layer covering the molar teeth of primates that can be used to infer diet in fossil species. The project used methods from the material sciences to map the physical and chemical properties in the enamel of 22 molar teeth from 10 different primate species. The goals of this project were broken into two objectives: 1) to determine how the properties of tooth enamel vary within and across the molar crown of primates, and 2) to identify the underlying adaptations responsible for this variation, in the chemistry and structure of the enamel itself. The results help us to understand how teeth work to chew foods over long periods without failure in animals that eat diverse diets that include very hard and tough objects.

 

The first goal of this project was studied using nanoindetation, which mapped the mechanical properties (hardness and stiffness) in the enamel layer of each tooth in the sample. Tooth enamel is well-suited to breaking down foods during chewing because of it has high hardness and stiffness compared to other biological tissues. However, under the wrong circumstances, teeth can fail due to fracture and wear resulting in poor chewing performance and creating pathways for infection. A major outcome of this project was to show how hardness and stiffness change throughout the enamel layer in the molar teeth of primates, in ways that help their teeth resist fracture and wear. Furthermore, the evidence suggested that hardness and stiffness vary across species in a manner associated with their dietary behavior. These findings illustrated adaptations in primate tooth enamel that were inherited from their common mammalian ancestor, but also possible adaptations within lineages that rely on mechanically challenging diets.

 

The second goal of this project was studied using electron microprobe analysis and high-magnification microscopy. The electron microprobe was used to map changes in the chemical structure of enamel in the teeth and in the same locations where mechanical properties were mapped. This yielded the most complete database yet assembled on the mechanical properties and enamel chemistry of primate tooth enamel. The enamel chemistry data provided several possible explanations for the changes in hardness and stiffness in the enamel of primate teeth. These included the finding that hardness and stiffness were significantly correlated with changes in the relative amount of protein that remains in primate tooth enamel after it grows and mineralizes during development. The inclusion of trace elements within primate tooth enamel was also implicated as a factor in the variation of hardness and stiffness in primate enamel. Microscopy was used to examine the underlying mineral structure of the enamel layer, which takes the form of small mineral crystallites packed together in long prisms that ultimately build the crown of the tooth. Here, the hardness and stiffness of enamel was related to the density of these prisms, suggesting an important signal of adaptation lies in the behavior of enamel-producing cells during tooth development.

 

In addition to providing the largest dataset on the physical and chemical properties of primate teeth, this project has illuminated new and important adaptations related to the function and resilience of the enamel layer our closest living relatives. This information is essential for research that develops methods to repair, regenerate, or replace enamel; the only hard tissue in the mammalian body that cannot do so on its own.

"Old Dominion University is awarded an Early Faculty Career Development grant to support Dr Shuiwang Ji in research leading to a better understanding of the brain. The brain is an enormously complex system, and the analysis of brain data is thus an equally enormous challenge. Human brains contain billions of neurons and trillions of synapses (junctions); and each of them is unique in their basic biochemistry, functions, and dynamics. The brain is also a multi-level system organized across different spatial scales, ranging from genes, synapses, and cells to circuits, brain regions, and systems. Today, brain science is experiencing rapid changes and is expected to achieve major advances in the near future. Recent technological innovations are enabling scientists to capture the gene expression patterns, connectivity, and neuronal activities at increasing speed and resolution. This is generating a deluge of data that capture the brain activities at different levels of organization. To attack the central challenges of analyzing these new data, this project will develop a class of efficient, integrative, multidimensional, predictive, and correlative techniques and use them to analyze large-scale, high-resolution, and multi-modality sets of brain data. Specifically, this project will develop analytics tools to predict the cellular-resolution, brain-wide connectome (""wiring diagram"") from genetic transcriptional profiles. This analysis will elucidate the information pathway from genes to connectivity and ultimately, to function. This project will also integrate other brain dimensions by performing multidimensional network correlative analytics. In addition, this project will address the relationship between gene expression, cell types, and brain structures. The success of this project will be a new class of efficient, robust analytics methods that are flexible enough to be adapted for integrating, modeling, and mining current and future brain data.

The results of this project will have an immediate and strong impact on multiple disciplines, including brain data analytics and computational neuroscience, biological image informatics, and big data analytics. A future long term goal is to uncover basic underlying differences between normal and impaired brain functions. The unified treatment of brain data analytics will be readily transformable into new courses for training next-generation computational biologists. The multidisciplinary nature of this project provides unique opportunities for integrating its components into existing curricula. Brain science has been shown to be a valuable resource for inspiring scientific interests in K-12 students. Components of the project will be integrated into an existing high-school student internship program, thereby inspiring future science students.

The human brain contains billions of neurons and trillions of synapses; and each of them is unique in their fundamental biochemistry, functions, and dynamics. The brain is also a multi-level system organized across different spatial scales, ranging from genes, synapses, and cells to circuits, brain regions, and systems. To attack the central challenges of brain data analytics, I developed a class of efficient, integrative, multidimensional, predictive, and correlative techniques and use them to analyze large-scale, high-resolution, and multi-modality brain data. I performed predictive analytics in which the cellular-resolution, brain-wide connectome is predicted from genetic transcriptional profiles. This analysis elucidates the information pathway from genes to connectivity and ultimately, to function. Secondly, I integrated other brain dimensions by performing multidimensional network correlative analytics. This type of analysis is based on a new class of probability distributions defined on multidimensional data arrays. My third initiative addressed the relationship between gene expression, cell types, and brain structures. All of the novel analytics methods in this project is based on a common foundation of the sparsity learning paradigm, which was originally motivated by neuronal information processing mechanisms. Overall, I developed three novel and significant advances in the scientific field of computational brain data analytics. Each advance dramatically extended current analytics techniques towards understanding multi-level, complex brain systems. Altogether, I developed a unified approach to deciphering the brain structure and function and provide a systematic framework for developing the methodologies to implement them. Multiple high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students have been trained throughout this project.

"The science of forecasting where a species can live and how it responds to climate change is still in its infancy. A species' geographic range is the map of where a species can be found. It is fundamental to understanding species' ecology and evolution and increasingly plays a vital role in conservation. Collections of species ranges covering most of the 30,000 terrestrial vertebrate species are already available for scientific analysis. However, collections of species ranges from the other ~95% of species on the planet are rare. The time is ripe to change this. New access to vast quantities of data from biological inventories, museums, citizen science, and previously funded studies mean that adequate data are available to estimate the ranges of many more species. However, we are currently missing robust forecasting methods and the computational tools to produce large numbers of ranges. This project will develop the novel computational methods and algorithms needed to forecast the current state and future fate of the many thousands of poorly studied species ranges. These methods will be applied to forecast how 100,000+ plant species in the New World will respond to climate change. The researchers will test key assumptions in conservation biology about how species respond to changing climate and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots across North and South America have/will change over time.  The end result of their work will be a novel tool for the ecological community that has tremendous potential to guide biological sampling strategies, particularly in conservation and citizen science applications. 

The proposed research will examine whether biodiversity hotspots are constant through time and whether species climatic niches are phylogenetically conserved, two implicit assumptions with wide-reaching implications in conservation biology and basic ecology. This research will develop a workflow to predict species ranges for any taxonomic group using by combining occurrence data with GIS data. This workflow will be applied to all New World plants to study basic questions, such as how species richness varies across space and time (a topic studied almost exclusively in vertebrates and trees). Computationally, the project will address core challenges in data scrubbing, niche modeling practices, novel niche modeling methods, and mega-phylogeny analysis methods.  A freely available generic pipeline will be capable of linking biodiversity occurrence data to species ranges and scaling these computations to 1000s or 100,000s of species. This integrated pipeline will be implemented by: 1) appropriately scrubbing data to remove taxonomic and geographic errors, 2) identifying clear best practice methods for range modeling applicable across diverse species, 3) innovating range modeling methods that integrate diverse data such as presence only museum collections and abundance-based plot data 4) scaling computationally-intensive range modeling in an HPC environment, and 5) placing the outputs of the products in a phylogenetic context. This project will develop such a pipeline using a novel database of 20,000,000 observations of 100,000+ species of plants in the New World. The range forecasts produced will be used to test key assumptions in conservation biology about the phylogenetic conservatism of species climatic niches and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots over time. This research will make substantial contributions to scientific infrastructure through the development of a scientific codebase for the production of high-quality species ranges from primary biodiversity data.

The initial efforts in this project were to: 1) improve the largest database to date recording every scientific observation of a plant species available electronically. It eventually grew to have over 100,000,000 observations of plants with well over 100,000 species worldwide. 2) To use these observations to generate maps of species ranges, the areas where a species lives. A key focus in the first step was to scrub or clean the data. As you might imagine data collected by 1000s of scientists stored in hundreds of institutions is not particular standardized nor is it usually usually inspected for errors. But doing good science requires accurate information.  All of this data and the tools we developed are shared openly and freely with the scientific community to enhance their productivity in other biodiversity informatics endeavors (e.g. other groups of species). 

One key result from this work was discovering just how numerous rare species are. It has always been known that it was a rather common state to be rare (there are many more rare species than widely spread abundant species). But we were surprised just how many rare species there are among plants globally (almost 37% are extremely rare). There are more rare species than any existing theory predicted. We also mapped areas of the world known as hotspots that have a high number of rare species.  These areas become important targets for efforts to protect more land (e.g. by creating new national parks). In identifying these areas we also found that these areas are among some of the areas most impacted by humans and climate change, making their protection urgent.









Another important result was exploring the linkage between protected lands and the risk of extinction from future climate change. Although it is obvious that more protected lands is better for biodiversity and further that that should hold for reducing risk of extinction from climate change, quantitative relationships had not been produced for large areas before. Overall our assessment found that extinction risk drops most dramatically when increasing from about 15% protected lands to about 30%. Currently about 15% of land is protected, and many conservation treaties seek to protect up to 30%. This study validated that there are indeed major reductions in extinction risk in moving from where we are today to protecting about twice as much land. At the same time this study demonstrated the need for protecting more land, it also shows that there are major benefits to biodiversity even if a majority of the land remains devoted to human needs. Such win-win outcomes are desperately needed in conservation. 

In addition to informing conservation efforts and providing new tools to other scientists working in biodiversity informatics, this project provided training to about a dozen graduate students and postdocs in this newly emerging field at the interface of traditional ecology and data science. Most of these students plan to go into biodiversity informatics themselves, but some have transferred their data science skills into industry unrelated to biodiversity. Either way, training experts in data science helps to close the large gap between needed and available personnel in this rapidly growing field.
