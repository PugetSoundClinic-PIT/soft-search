"The functional molecules in cells are proteins - the expression, activity and interactions of particular proteins in any given cell define its structure and what it is capable of doing. The technologies used to study proteins on a large scale are collectively called proteomics. The main method used in proteomics is mass spectrometry (MS), which can calculate the molecular weight and abundance of molecules. The majority of proteomics workflows perform a step of protein digestion prior to MS. The result of digestion is that all the proteins become broken up into small chains, called peptides. This step has become common, because peptides are easier to analyse by MS, due to their lower mass, producing simpler data to interpret. One challenge in this digestion step is that some proteins break down quickly whereas for others digestion is incomplete, producing unreliable quantification data that are not fully understood or compensated for by current analysis software. To overcome this problem, the University of Texas Anderson Cancer Center will collaborate with the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom to develop an integrated suite of analysis techniques using a powerful statistical technique called Bayesian modelling. These advances will be incorporated into a freely available software suite.
  
Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) coupled to Liquid Chromatography (LC) is the primary technique used in proteomics. The most common approach is LC separation of tryptic fragments derived from a proteome digestion, followed by tandem MS of the peptides. This entire workflow is conceived as a series of discrete steps, some chemical, some instrumental, some informatics and some statistical. Existing software concentrates on subcomponents of the workflow, and comprise a series of deterministic, self-contained steps. This project will translate the whole protein quantification pipeline into a rigorous statistical framework underpinned by Bayesian methodology. The new framework will integrate evidence across all experimentally acquired datasets, and borrow strength from unused structure within a proteomics workflow, including digestion dynamics. The proposed pipeline consists of three synergistic developments (1) Utilization of all unidentified (peptide) features, as well as identified features, to infer the most likely mixture of proteins present in a sample; (2) Differential quantification of complex mixtures of known proteoforms; (3) Discovery of unknown proteoforms and all modifications (PTMs) carried by their quantification signatures. These advancements will elicit a step-change in quantification sensitivity and interpretation at the proteoform level for the first time. The end-to-end analysis solution will be made available within the user-centric standards compliant ProteoSuite package, and as a Galaxy workflow for high-throughput pipelines.",NSF,University of Pennsylvania,PA,98079,2016487,jeffrey.morris@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,Jeffrey,Morris,0,"From this award, we have developed a set of statistical tools designed for extracting meaningful information about proteins expressed in a clinical sample that might have clinical or biological utility, and would be missed by simple, standard approaches.  We treat these data as ""complex functional data"", a type of data increasingly encountered in many areas of biological and medical research.  The develop,ent of general rigorous methods for these data that can model the entire data set without discarding information contained in the rich data, while accounting for their complex internal structure, promises to make a strong impact in many areas of biomedical research, withthe key being the ability to uncover insights contained in the data that would have been missed by simplistic current analytical approaches.  

While motivated by and applied to protein data applications in which the protein expressions in a clinical sample are used to infer information about the patient's clinical response or undelrying biological processes, the methods have broad application in many other data types including but not limited to genomic data, wearable devices, imaging data, and climate data.  In this grant period, we have developed a suite of models, methods, and software to fit them and freely shared these with the broad research community.  Besides developing these tools, we have also applied them to reveal important insights into various types of cancers as well as glaucoma.  

This work has produced dozens of peer-reviewed publications in statistical, biological, and clinical journals as well as numerous talks at national and international conferences.

"Biologists are deluged with sequence data yet have derived comparatively little biological information from it. The accurate annotation of protein function is key to understanding life, but experimentally determining what each protein does is costly and difficult, and cannot scale up to accommodate the vast amount of sequence data already available. Therefore discovering protein protein function by computational, rather than experimental means, is of primary importance. Genomic sequence data are available from thousands of species,  and those are coupled with massive high-throughput experimental data. Together, these data have created new opportunities as well as challenges for computational function prediction. As a result, many computational annotation methods have been developed by research groups worldwide, but their accuracy and applicability need to be improved upon. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG) is to bring together computational biologists, experimental biologists and biocurators who are dealing with the important problem of predicting protein function, to share ideas, and create collaborations. To improve computational function prediction methods, the Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation algorithms (CAFA) was established as an ongoing experiment. CAFA was designed to provide a large-scale assessment of computational methods dedicated to predicting protein function. By challenging dozens of research groups worldwide to develop and provide their best software for function prediction, the researchers involved in the AFP-SIG will improve the ability of biologists to understand life at the molecular level. The AFP-SIG researchers will also generate experimental data from fruit-flies, fungi and bacteria to be used as benchmarks to test the software participating in CAFA, and a deeper understanding of these model organisms. 

It is now possible to collect data that comprehensively profile many different states of complex biological systems. Using these data it should be possible to understand and explain the underlying systems, but significant challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is that, as researchers collect more data from many different organisms in many different systems, they discover more and different genes. Assigning functions to these newly discovered genes represents a key step towards interpretation of high-throughput data. This leads to a critical need to assess the quality of the function prediction methods that researchers have developed in recent years. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG), founded in 2005, is to bring together bioinformaticians and biologists who are addressing this key challenge of gene function prediction. In addition to sharing ideas and creating collaboration, AFP-SIG has created CAFA: the Critical Assessment of (protein) Function Annotation. CAFA is a community-driven challenge to assess the performance of protein function prediction software, and it has been carried out twice since 2010.  The investigators will provide the following outcomes: (1) robust open-source software to be used in function prediction and assessment of function prediction methods, incorporated into the high-profile annotation pipelines of UniProt-GOA; (2) expansion of the AFP community by engaging bioinformaticians, biocurators and experimentalists, thereby improving the quality and relevance of function prediction methods; (3) large-scale experimental screens in Drosophila, Candida and Pseudomonas for novel associations of targeted functional terms with genes; (4) an expanded CAFA event, incorporating both the curated annotations from the literature and our own experimental screens, in the last two years of the project. The progress of the AFP-SIG and CAFA will be available from http://BioFunctionPrediction.org",NSF,Northeastern University,MA,82617,1854685,predrag@northeastern.edu,Predrag,Radivojac,0,"One of the key and most complex questions in the life sciences today is understanding the workings of life at a molecular level. In order to speed up discovery, however, it is necessary to combine experimental science and computation. Methodologies for protein function prediction are therefore an important component to the bigger questions as only a small fraction of these macromolecules can be studied in depth experimentally, where for the vast majority of them we might only be able to predict their biological roles. As there had been many methods for protein function prediction, we proposed to establish an independent and authoritative assessment of these techniques so that the scientific community and general public are aware of the state of the art in the field and also to stimulate further discovery in the field. We have done this successfully and fortunately we can report that in the past five years there has been an improvement in the overall accuracy of function prediction methods. Depending on their application, they can be used to understand general trends about functionalities of newly sequenced organisms or to prioritize biological experiments and optimize resource allocation. As part of the independent evaluation, we have performed our own experiments and have assigned functional terms to more than 1000 proteins from three species, thus demonstrating the synergy between experiment and computation. This project has also developed methodologies and approaches that extend to general science, mostly machine learning and through machine learning to many other fields. We have proposed new methods for dealing with data from so-called open world domains, where molecular data belongs, which will have applications in diverse fields. We have also established novel distance functions that unify some known distances across different types of data.  We have held four scientific meetings with more than 500 delegates in total, providing a forum for exchange of ideas and also networking opportunities. Finally, we have trained new generation of graduate students with the ability to think critically and work independently in this and related fields. We have also trained undergraduate researchers, two of whom have been from HBCU's. Both of these individuals have later proceeded to go to the graduate school. Overall, we believe this project has been highly successful.

"This doctoral research project examines how trauma experienced by women may be transmitted across generations, affecting their well-being and the well-being of their children. Working with populations who have endured high-stress environments, the investigators will conduct in-depth interviews with women when they are pregnant and subsequently measure markers of stress in those women and their infants, to understand how trauma affects women and children socially, emotionally, and biologically. Through these bio-ethnographic methods, the project will advance our understanding of epigenetic responses to the environment in humans. The project will also contribute to graduate training and mentoring and may inform public health research and behavioral health interventions. 

This project considers how biosocial inheritance, or the means by which social adversity or advantage is transmitted across generations, may play a role in intergenerational trauma. Specifically, this project considers (1) how women enduring adverse environments subjectively construct their traumatic experience; (2) whether maternal trauma may be ""molecularized"" at the level of the epigenome; (3) whether maternal traumatic experience is associated with neuroendocrine stress during pregnancy; and (4) whether maternal epigenetic or neuroendocrine signals correspond to those seen in offspring in early life. In this study of 112 mother-infant dyads, mothers' subjective appraisals of trauma will be elicited through semi-structured and life history interviews, which will be used to contextualize their responses to a survey of traumatic exposure and a trauma symptoms checklist. Their biological incorporation of trauma will be assessed with measures of DNA methylation and hair cortisol concentration. Methylation will be measured at five genes that are involved in the neuroendocrine stress response: NR3C1, FKBP5, BDNF, SLC6A4, and MAOA. To evaluate for broader patterns of epigenetic modification, epigenome-wide methylation analyses will also be conducted. To investigate the potential for intergenerational programming, this project will measure chronic cortisol secretion in mothers, cortisol reactivity following a modest stressor in infants at eight weeks of age, and DNA methylation at these five stress-related loci in both mothers and infants.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Yale University,CT,23064,1918769,marcia.inhorn@yale.edu,Marcia,Inhorn,1,"This research evaluated the experience of Latina migrant mothers living in New Haven, Connecticut amid the COVID-19 pandemic. I asked: How do Latin American migrant women accommodate traumatic histories and motherhood amid the COVID-19 pandemic? My ethnography demonstrates the powerful ways women cope with histories of trauma and ongoing adversity. Using the metaphor of the monarch butterfly, I consider processes of migration from Latin America and adjustment to life in the U.S., motherhood including the sacrifices women make for the betterment of their children, and metamorphosis, or transformations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing structural vulnerability. Using person-centered ethnography, oral history, and archival data, I consider women's experiences within their political, social, historical, and cultural contexts.

First, I re-evaluate the demographic category of ""Latinx,"" consider patterns of migration from Latin America to New Haven, examine relationships between the Black and Latinx communities of New Haven, and trace movements of collective organizing for empowerment of the New Haven Latinx community. 

Second, I narrate the lives of migrant mothers, attending to their experiences of state failure in Latin America, ongoing structural violence in the U.S., and adaptation, focusing on the ways women orient themselves toward the futures of their children. I coin the terms ""strategic coupling"" to characterize the ways women engage in romantic and legal relationships with men to access social, political, and financial capital; ""imperative resilience"" to describe cognitive and social strategies of survival and resistance to oppressive regimes; and ""intergenerational fortitude"" to refer to the ways women harness the wisdom, experience, and values of their maternal forbearers to better support their children.

Finally, I discuss the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on migrant populations, expose the racism Latina mothers experience during pregnancy and birth and the ways they are excluded from services for which they are eligible when seeking healcare, and discuss policy solutions to mitigate the harms of structural vulnerability for Latin American migrant mothers.

Through this engaged and ethnographic work, I aim to promote structural competency for scholars and clinicians and advance health equity for migrant communities.

"This doctoral dissertation project will examine the energetic cost of brown adipose tissue (BAT), a heat-producing tissue known to be activated under cold conditions, in 100 adults from a lower-latitude population. Research on BAT in adults has been relatively understudied, and this project will expand the available data and geographic scope for investigating BAT’s role in human heat production, energy allocation, and cold adaptation. The project will advance fundamental knowledge in human biology, and may also inform public health research on obesity and diabetes. In addition to the direct transmission of some data to study participants, project outcomes will be shared with the greater public through platforms such as social media, public talks, and publications in open-access journals. Furthermore, this study will foster research collaborations with local research assistants, who will develop STEM research skills and facilitate the smooth and culturally appropriate implementation of the project. 

BAT has been extensively studied in hibernating mammals and in human infants, but fewer studies have focused on its functions in adults. Researchers have suggested that BAT may have played a role in human evolution as an adaptive defense mechanism against chronic cold and that it may also be useful in reducing risks of metabolic diseases given its physiological effects on metabolism. In this study, BAT function will be examined in a lower-latitude population showing an average body size and shape that is morphologically best adapted to retain heat despite living in a warm region. BAT will be inferred by comparing metabolic rates and heat dissipation in the chest and shoulder area (main BAT location in adults) at room temperature and at mild cold exposure. Simultaneously, fasting glucose levels as well as respiratory quotients (a ratio determining metabolic substrates consumed) will be measured before and after BAT activation to determine BAT’s use of glucose. By determining the metabolic and heat-producing capabilities of BAT in the study population, this research will parse out how BAT may be a physiological reflection of cold adapted morphology and by extension how BAT may have played a role in the successful dispersal of humans into different ecological settings independent of their morphology. A better understanding of the energy consumption and glucose disposal of BAT can provide insight into its potential utility in weight gain and diabetes prevention. These potential health benefits of BAT activation are especially important for regions burdened by high rates of obesity and diabetes.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Notre Dame,IN,26476,1945331,cocobock@nd.edu,Cara,Ocobock,1,"This project ""Thermogenesis and Energetic Costs in Humans"" investigated brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity and its associated metabolic health effects in Samoans. This work determined whether BAT, a heat-producing tissue was activated in a warm-climate population and how its associated effects on health may vary between Samoan adults. All data was collected in collaboration with and by the local non-profit Obesity, Lifestyle and Genetic Adaptations (OLaGA) study group in Apia, Samoa (n=100) between January and July 2021. The findings from this study provide some of the first evidence for the metabolic effects of BAT in a warm-climate population. Given the potential health benefits, such as reduced blood sugar levels and increases in the numbers of calories burned, associated with BAT, inferring BAT in a sample with obesity plays a critical role in our understanding of how BAT could benefit public health in Samoa and elsewhere. 

The study outcomes show that BAT activity can be inferred in humans independent of their climatic environment. The heat-producing capacities of BAT are activated at their highest rate when an individual experiences cold exposure, previously leading human biologists to believe that BAT is a cold-adapted trait found only in cold-adapted and cold-acclimatized populations. Our findings provide evidence that BAT is also found in adults with little to no daily cold exposure. Furthermore, this study provides additional evidence to a growing body of work showing that BAT is not only activated in adults with obesity but also contributes to greater rates of blood sugar use, ultimately reducing the risk of type II diabetes. These outcomes have several main takeaways contributing to future research questions and health interventions. 

First, evidence of BAT in Samoans suggests that BAT is a pan-human trait, found across all populations, independent of evolutionary history. While additional data is needed to compare the variation in the metabolic effects of BAT between populations and individuals, these results suggests that BAT is a common cold-adapted trait that likely played a role in the successful expansion of humans across various climates, providing additional protection from climatic fluctuations as groups migrated across the globe. Our results, thus, provide further evidence for the adaptability of humans and further informs us about the evolutionary history and success of humans in surviving and thriving in various environments. 

Second, this project is the accumulation of data showing how BAT activity is beneficial for metabolic health and may be used for obesity and type II diabetes prevention in the future. Blood glucose levels decreased significantly in Samoans with obesity and at high risk of type II diabetes suggesting that BAT is using blood sugar for heat production. This increased disposal of blood sugar decreases the risk of type II diabetes. Future work will further investigate the variation in the effects of BAT on metabolic health between populations and individuals, leading to evidence-based community-specific health interventions combating cardiovascular and metabolic disease. 

Third, this project directly contributed to participants’ understanding of their personal metabolic health as all participants left their testing appointment with a feedback sheet summarizing their personal metabolic and bio-health marker results complete with health and weight loss recommendations and tips. Together with the Samoan Ministry of Health a larger information campaign will result in the dissemination of the study results to the community and beyond, raising awareness about the benefits of BAT research and participating in research studies. 

Fourth, research assistants who participated in data collection were all trained by the co-PI Niclou and have gained new skills such as measuring skin heat dissipation and cooling protocols for inferring BAT. Using these skills, this local Samoan research team will be able to implement new research questions, study designs, and protocol developments in Samoa, contributing to the growing public health research efforts and interventions in their own country. 

Finally, this project also contributed to the scientific and educational training of a PhD student (Niclou). Niclou will continue working on BAT research, further delving into its evolutionary and health aspects. So far, this project has resulted in a completed and defended doctoral dissertation, multiple conference presentations (with two more to be presented later this year), and three papers that will be submitted for peer-review in academic publications in the near future. The project has also received attention outside of the field of anthropology and academia. Niclou was invited to talk about her research on podcasts and at workshops, helping spread the word about the need for greater research on BAT and its beneficial effects on health. We aim to continue sharing our findings in Samoa and in the US with fellow researchers and with the public.

"How do animals who live in social groups make decisions about what the group should do? Does a dominant individual lead the group, or can multiple individuals contribute to decision-making?  This doctoral dissertation project will investigate group decision-making in wild spider monkeys, who frequently split into smaller groups and re-form the larger group (fission-fusion) when feeding. The investigator hypothesizes that fission-fusion social grouping is driven by the energetic needs of multiple individuals and promotes egalitarian social organization (equal power among individuals). How groups decide when and where to move in their habitat and who exerts the most influence is vital to identifying the costs and benefits of group living, and this research will provide insight into the emergence of egalitarian social dynamics in human societies. This project will support academic training and mentorship for students under-represented in STEM fields, thereby fostering interest in the sciences at the K-12 level and providing field research opportunities for undergraduate students. Additionally, this project will promote international collaborations, hands-on workshops, and public science seminars.

A key challenge to studying how group decisions are made is determining the motivations driving individuals' decisions, and thus the link between individual needs and collective action. Some evidence suggests that fission-fusion social organization may promote egalitarian social norms by allowing individuals to split away from despotic group members when decisions about what to do or where to go do not align with their individual needs. Using wild black-handed spider monkeys as a model system, this study combines well-established observational field methods of behavior, foraging theory models, and laboratory techniques for quantifying energy balance, to provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the collective decision-making process in fission-fusion societies. The investigator will collect observational data on leadership and decision-making and analytical data on individual energetic state as indicated by C-peptide analysis of non-invasively collected urine samples. The project will address three main hypotheses: 1) spider monkeys engage in shared decision-making, 2) groups tend to fission when conflicts between individuals are high, and 3) individuals lead according to their physiological need as opposed to dominance or social power.",NSF,University of California-Davis,CA,25200,1751750,mccrofoot@ucdavis.edu,Margaret,Crofoot,1,"Animals (including humans) face a constant and varied stream of decisions about where to go and what to do. In social species, individuals must weigh their personal needs against the (potentially incompatible) actions of others, as well as their need to remain with group members. However, group members often have different physiological needs or abilities, causing their interests to diverge. When faced with such conflicts of interest over what to do, individuals living in fission-fusion societies (societies where groups flexibly separate into temporary subgroups and then reform) can either split off to pursue their own goals or they can compromise, and remain together with close social partners.  A key challenge to studying how group decisions are made in the wild is determining the motivations driving individuals? decisions, and thus the link between individual needs and collective action. This project sought to overcome this challenge in two ways: (1) by linking predictions derived from theoretical models of animal behavior to collective decision-making, and (2) by assessing individual motivation via a direct measure of individual energetic need (hormonal bio-markers of energy balance from urinary C-peptide levels). We examined decision-making and leadership in black-handed spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) on Barro Colorado Island, Panama using data on foraging behavior, fission-fusion grouping patterns, social relationships, and leadership during group movements. Using an observational technique called the focal tree method, we collected data on spider monkey group feedings in key resources to predict variation in individual preferences about when and where to go next. We further analyzed individual attempts to initiate group movement to understand who exerts influence on group decisions and then correlated movement initiations with physiological measures of energetic condition (i.e. do hungry monkeys with low energetic condition lead more often?). We use a novel method for analyzing urinary C-peptide (a by-product of insulin indicating energetic condition) in spider monkeys, providing some of the first of how physiological condition influences collective decision-making in primates. Results indicate that while all individuals make initiation attempts to move to subsequent feeding trees, initiation success is not predicted by simple age/sex class categories. Instead, variation in individual physiological need (i.e. how hungry an animal is) translates into who is a leader in fission-fusion groups of spider monkeys. Group members share decisions and mitigate decision costs by subgrouping when conflicts of interest arise. This study combines observational methods in animal behavior with theoretical foraging models to provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the decisions individuals in groups must make to survive, and the processes by which shared decision-making arises in fission-fusion societies. How group-level actions emerge from the behavioral decisions of individuals, and how certain group-members arise as leaders are central questions we must answer to understand the evolution of complex social systems like our own.

This grant provided invaluable resources and training for the co-PI Grace Davis, field assistants in Panama, and data technicians in the US and Germany. Davis has formed long-term collaborations with mentors Meg Crofoot, Christina Campbell, and Melissa Emery Thompson on the hormonal correlates of collective behavior in wild primates and furthered a research program on the primate communities on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Davis actively mentors underrepresented students and research assistants on research methods and professional development from Central America, Canada, Rwanda, the US, and Germany. Davis has trained 17 students on the methods and data analyses for this project, the majority of whom have completed thesis projects expanding upon the main themes of this research. Davis is an active participant of the programs Kids into Discovering Science and the anthropology outreach program at UC Davis, and has given talks to school children in Germany. While in Panama, Davis participates in the outreach program Jungle in the Backyard, presenting research to Panamanian school groups to ignite curiosity about animals and the environment. Davis also makes this research accessible to the local community through interactive workshops, seminars, and guided forest walks at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. This research has been featured as part of the Smithsonian documentary Mysteries of the Rainforest and as part of the Leakey Foundation Public Seminar Series on YouTube.

"Aspects of lifestyle play an important role in shaping how individuals age, but most of what we know about human senescence stems from work with industrialized populations, who do not represent the full range of lifestyles modern humans engage in. This doctoral dissertation project will examine human aging in a non-industrialized population, and evaluate how aspects of lifestyle contribute to age-related patterns of physical and cognitive function. This project will help create a broader picture of how humans experience growing older across a range of biosocial contexts, and so advance our fundamental knowledge about human senescence. The project will inform public health research by examining whether certain aspects of aging can be mitigated through elements of lifestyle. Furthermore, by employing an interdisciplinary approach to the study of aging, this project will strengthen research infrastructure ties among several institutions and departments, and also contribute to the professional development of women in STEM fields. 

In industrialized populations, growing older is associated with declines in physical and cognitive function that limit independence and increase risk of disability. Large-scale epidemiological studies indicate that engaging in high levels of physical activity (PA) may attenuate age-related declines in function. It is not clear, then, whether the age-related functional declines seen in industrialized populations are inevitable aspects of human senescence or by-products of sedentary industrialized lifestyles. This project will examine variation in lifestyle and aging in hunter-gatherer populations that currently include members who continue to engage in full-time foraging, and others who engage in more market-integrated lifestyles with less reliance on foraging. The project tests the overarching hypothesis that variation in engagement in traditional foraging practices is associated with distinctive PA profiles that benefit age-related patterns of physical and cognitive function. Researchers will recruit participants (ages 18+) from communities who engage in different amounts of foraging, and participants will complete tests of physical and cognitive function. Participants will also wear an accelerometer for several days, allowing researchers to characterize patterns of PA. The researchers will compare age-related patterns of function for non-industrialized and industrialized populations, as well as assess whether amount of foraging is related to variation in age-related patterns of function. They will also use formal mediation analyses to assess how patterns of PA influence the relationship between age, function, and amount of foraging.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Southern California,CA,32819,2051519,draichle@usc.edu,David,Raichlen,1,"Age-related declines in physical and cognitive function seem inevitable, and challenge both the health and quality of life of older adults. Given our rapidly aging global population, it is imperative that we understand which aspects of human aging are indeed inevitable, and which may be modifiable. Decades of research highlight the importance that elements of lifestyle play in shaping health throughout life. However, most of our understanding of what ""normal"" human aging look like comes from work with industrialized populations, who do not represent the enormous variety of ways modern humans live. In order to create a more comprehensive understanding of how elements of lifestyle impact human biology throughout life, we must broaden our study of human aging to include populations who engage in different kinds of lifestyles.

The Hadza are a population of subsistence-oriented foragers who live in northern Tanzania and are known for being highly physically active throughout life. Changes to their environment over the past several decades have challenged the Hadza’s traditional way of life, and as a result, many Hadza women and men engage in a variety of subsistence practices. Our goal is to examine variation in lifestyle and aging among Hadza men and women who engage in different amounts of traditional foraging practices. Here, we test the hypothesis that variation in foraging engagement is associated with distinctive physical activity (PA) profiles that benefit age-related patterns of physical and cognitive function.  

To test this hypothesis, we measured PA and physical and cognitive function with Hadza men and women (ages 18+) living in 12 different communities (or ""camps"") in northern Tanzania. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that Hadza men and women living in different types of camps (i.e., more foraging-oriented ""bush"" camps versus more settled ""village"" camps) do not engage in different amounts of PA&mdash;we found that Hadza living in all camp types were highly physically active, even over the age of 60. We also found that some measures of PA were associated with measures of function. Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was positively associated with performance on a test of spatial working memory, and daily step count was positively associated with a test of walking endurance, even when controlling for the effects of age. In fact, daily step count partially mediated the negative effect of age on walking endurance, even within this highly active population.

We believe that this project, by providing a cross-cultural perspective on human aging, has relevance not only for Biological Anthropology, but for public health more broadly. Our project contributes to a growing body of work with subsistence-oriented populations that highlights the complex effects that market integration can have on a population in transition. Furthermore, our project examines the relationship between lifestyle and aging outside of an industrialized context, and so contributes to our ability to differentiate between which aspects of aging modifiable, and which are not.

In addition to meeting our intellectual merit project goals, we accomplished our goals for generating broader impacts from this work including providing invaluable experience in fieldwork, project management, and professional development for a female graduate student. Our project was also able to directly contribute to the communities we work with by providing Hadza men, women, and children access to medical care and treatment that can otherwise be extremely difficult to obtain.

"Proteins are the 'workhorse' molecules of life, they participate in nearly every activity that cells carry out. It follows that understanding protein structure and function is essential to understanding life processes, and how to control or modify them. Biochemistry and biophysics experiments give the most accurate data on protein structure and function, but the experiments are often expensive and too specialized for many of the cell and molecular biologists focused on a particular interesting protein. This means that reliable computational predictions of protein structure and function are in high demand. These techniques are also specialized but can be automated, which is the focus of this project, which aims to develop an integrated platform for high-resolution protein structure prediction and structure-based function annotation that is accessible from the Web. This resource will significantly enhance studies of individual proteins as well as processes in cellular biology and other biological sciences. Through the collaboration of the two institutions, students at NCAT will learn state of the art high performance computing methods, and workshops at both institutions will provide greater understanding of the capabilities of the new resource. 

Proteins are complex components of biological systems, and studies on their structure and function often require multiple approaches to measurement or modeling. Many of the advanced computer algorithms used in this modeling are highly specialized, involving a number of complicated processes for each aspect of the protein modeling. Biologists whose primary interest is the final result often cannot determine which algorithm or pipeline to choose, how to enter parameters, or how to interpret the resulting models. While continuing to improve the accuracy of the core algorithms in protein structure prediction and structure-based function annotation, this project will also make improvements to domain parsing and assembly, to improve the quality of complex protein structure and function modeling. Another major focus of this project is to develop new protocols that automatically guide protein targets to the most suitable pipelines. In conjunction with this there will be new confidence scoring systems, both global and local, to assist biological users as they interpret the modeling results. In addition, advanced parallel computing and graphic processor unit techniques will be implemented in order to accelerate the pipelines and reduce user's waiting time.  New opportunities will be made for improving educational outcomes, in particular for women and minority students, in both University of Michigan and the North Carolina A&T State University. The on-line protein modeling system will be accessible to the community at http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu.",NSF,Wichita State University,KS,88512,2021734,dbkc@mtu.edu,Dukka,KC,0,"With the advent of widely available GPGPU hardware on numerous platforms and the ongoing development of programming API's, these specialized processors have been widely applied to various scientific tasks.  The project help develop GPU-I-TASSER, a GPU-enabled I-TASSER protein structure pipeline that is 10x faster than the existing I-TASSER pipeline which is one of the most successful protein structure prediction pipelines.

 

GPU-I-TASSER which is freely available to the scientific community, will be an invaluable tool to predict protein structure in proteome scale which is likely to be very useful in various other structural bioinformatics problems/topic areas. This would really accelerate the field of structural bioinformatics and accelerate use of structures(predicted) in various fields including drug discovery. 

 

Ability to predict protein structures efficiently brings broader impacts within and beyond the field of structural bioinformatics. In addition, student from underrepresented groups were trained in the intersection of biology and high-performance computing. More than 43 participants representing 13 different institutions including many HBCUs participated in the workshop. This will help in the diversity of the STEM field. In addition, workshops were conducted to share the knowledge with a large community of researchers. In addition, a book chapter and 2 journal articles and 2 conference papers were published using the results of the project.

"Humans have unique upright body posture and related anatomy, but paleontologists are not certain when these features first appeared in the hominin lineage. The aim of this doctoral research project is to functionally describe the anatomy of the primate neck to understand how differences in the neck are related to head posture, body posture, and locomotion in primates. The project will provide data that may be used for inferring when a human-like neck first appeared and how this anatomical change was associated with environmental, behavioral and biological factors. This study will employ a combination of 3D anatomical methods including CT scanning, digital muscle fascicle tracking, and biomechanical modeling, which will serve as training tools for future researchers and health care professionals. The 3D models generated in this study will be used in K-12 science education and outreach events for discussing human anatomy and primate conservation.

The objective of this study is to both characterize and quantify neck muscle anatomy in primates with different habitual body postures and locomotor behaviors. Using a biomechanical framework, the project will compare functional differences in neck musculature that are key for behaviors such as holding up the head and movement of the arms during suspension. Novel techniques including contrast-enhanced computed tomography, muscle fascicle tracking software, and 3D lever mechanics will be used to develop biomechanical models of how variation in muscle size, shape, and distribution is related to postural and locomotor behavior across primates. These biomechanical models will be applied to fossil hominins (Australopithecus sediba and Homo neanderthalensis) to interpret their neck anatomy and posture to more accurately understand and reconstruct their behaviors.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Missouri-Columbia,MO,8576,1919475,wardcv@missouri.edu,Carol,Ward,1,"This project sought to understand the evolution of our own species through the lens of function in the musculoskeletal system. The ways in which the individual bones and muscles are arranged both internally and externally, can help us understand their function. The neck is a complex structure in that it supports the head, helps an organism navigate through its environment, and participates in feeding and swallowing. Primates are noted for diversity in locomotor behaviors, diet, as well as large brains relative to body size. As such, the head, neck, and musculature that spans between them can be potentially tied to any or all these functions.

While we know that species such as Australopithecus afarensis, which includes ?Lucy,? were bipedal, we still do not understand how their head was positioned relative to their trunk (i.e., neck posture) nor how much time they may have spent in trees. Further, we know that the ?Lucy? species was likely not the first upright biped in our lineage. In fossil human ancestors, the shape and size of the bones of the nuchal plane and cervical vertebrae (back of the head and neck) are thought to be a functional complex that helps balance and support of the head, rotates the neck, and serves as an anchor point to muscles involved in forelimb suspension. In particular, the position and the orientation of the foramen magnum and nuchal plane (parts of the cranium) and anatomy of the cervical vertebrae (neck bones), are used to make inferences about our own lineage and when and in what species upright posture and bipedal locomotion first appeared. Yet, no study to date has been able to quantify and understand how these muscles and bones work together to facilitate postural and locomotor behaviors. The goal of this study was to bridge our gap in knowledge on this subject using a variety of innovative techniques to understand how the neck works in our closest living relatives? the extant primates?before applying our knowledge to extinct species like our own fossil ancestors.

To understand how the nuchal muscles work across primates, this study used traditional dissection methods, contrast enhanced MicroCT scanning, as well as 3D lever mechanics to assess functional hypotheses. We sought to answer how postural and locomotor behaviors affect the size, shape and attachment sites of the muscles that span the back of the head and neck in a sample of primate cadavers. Specifically, this study was able to develop and apply new methods of semi-automatic muscle fascicle tracking, which allows for relatively non-invasive ways of quantifying muscle fascicle orientation, length, and number which are components of muscle function.

Results demonstrate that the shape and inferred function of the nuchal muscles do not reflect postural and locomotor behaviors as strongly as previously thought. There are a few exceptions to this finding. The first is that primates that have upright postures, like humans, demonstrate reduced force generation in a small muscle that extend the head and neck (longissimus capitis) compared to primates that have horizontal trunk postures. Second, primates that engage in vertical-clinging and leaping, like sifaka lemurs and the tarsier, may have modified neck muscles that allow them to rotate their head and neck more readily. Further, suspensory and semisuspensory behaviors (i.e., hanging from the arms) may influence the attachment size and orientation of the trapezius muscle in some primates, but this may not necessarily translate to an overall more powerful trapezius muscle.

Combined, these findings suggest that there may be more variables at play in determining the function nuchal musculature. More research is required to understand how the size and shape of the face and head, which house vital organs like the brain, affect the size and shape of the posterior neck muscles before making claims about how early human ancestors used their necks to interact with their environments.

"Unlike chronological age (the number of years a person has lived), biological age accounts for environmental, genetic and lifestyle factors that influence the pace of age-related changes. Diet is thought to be one such factor; however, the relationship between diet and biological aging is not well understood, and efforts to characterize this relationship have struggled to disentangle the effects of diet from other variables. This doctoral dissertation project will examine the effect of diet on the rate of biological aging using a newly developed epigenetic clock, a biomarker of biological age. This fundamental research will advance knowledge about human biology, life history, and senescence. The project may also inform public health and aging research by quantifying how lifestyle factors like diet ""get under the skin"" to influence the aging process and age-related disease. In addition, this project will contribute to the education, training and professional development of a female graduate student in a STEM field, and will include science outreach and education activities to engage with K-12 and public audiences.

The mechanisms that regulate the rate of biological aging are unknown but may have origins in the epigenome, a collection of chemical modifications to DNA that influence how genes are turned on or off. The epigenome is able to connect environment to genetics, and therefore plays a key role in explaining how environment and lifestyle factors can shape the pace of biological aging at the molecular level. Recently, age predictor models called epigenetic clocks have been developed that use age-associated changes in the epigenome to generate estimates of biological age. These clocks can be used to study the phenomenon of accelerated aging, where biological age exceeds chronological age. This project will construct a multi-tissue epigenetic clock and use this clock to test the effect of diet on biological age in a non-human primate model. The central hypothesis of this research is that an obesogenic diet accelerates biological aging and caloric restriction slows biological aging. The researchers will collect and analyze genome-wide methylation data from banked liver samples using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and combine these data with previously collected RRBS data from blood samples. A comparative non-human primate model with similar life history and disease risk can provide important insights into human aging.

Disparities in the rate of disease and mortality among same-aged individuals represents differences in how we age (referred to as biological aging) and emphasizes the need for better tools that can be used to identify environmental factors that slow or accelerate the aging process. This research addressed this need by producing and testing a sequence data-based, liver-specific epigenetic clock. The epigenome represents chemical modifications to the genome that control how genes work and can be responsive to environmental or behavioral changes, like changes in one’s diet. Epigenetic clocks capture modifications to the genome that correlate with chronological age and disease risk. Some individuals age at a pace that is faster or slower than others, suggesting aspects of behavior and environment are able to ""get under the skin"" and affect one’s propensity to age-related disease, disability, and mortality. We chose to develop an epigenetic clock for liver because the liver plays a central role in all metabolic processes of the body, and its continued functionality is critical to maintaining our health as we age. We developed this model for rhesus macaques, a long-lived, social non-human primate that is a highly relevant model for human aging. We applied our model to estimate biological age from liver samples and identify factors related to metabolism that accelerate or decelerate the pace of aging. Bioinformatic and statistical workflows generated by this research will be of use to researchers in the biological and biomedical sciences interested in generating or utilizing a sequence data-based epigenetic biomarker to test how environment shapes the aging process and influences predisposition to aging-related disease. Datasets generated from this study will be a valuable resource for researchers investigating the relationship between epigenetics, aging, and metabolism.

Broader Impact

While life expectancy in the United States has risen dramatically over the past several decades, the number of years spent free of major age-related disease and disability has remained relatively static.  This discrepancy and consequent reduction in the quality-of-life of many older individuals is a major public health concern. Knowledge and tools resulting from this study contribute to a larger body of research that seeks to understand the effects of personal and societal factors on the aging trajectory and how these factors contribute to variation observed in the aging process. A better understanding of why some individuals age more rapidly than others will better inform intervention strategies, policy decisions, and may help clinicians identify sub-clinical risk factors before they manifest as full-fledged disease, which may in turn help improve long-term health outcomes.

The funded research also supported the training of a PhD student at the University of Oregon. As part of this study, this student received advanced training in computer programming, bioinformatics, genomics, and statistics and gained considerable experience in these areas. This research has also enabled the student to grow her professional network to include a group of highly successful colleagues with different skill sets, perspectives and connections, both within and outside of academia. Importantly, this dissertation research will produce a PhD that contributes to a STEM field and increase diversity within areas of research where women are currently underrepresented. In addition, this research has also been used to support the training of an undergraduate as she completes her honor’s thesis and in undergraduate teaching at the University of Oregon. For example, we developed an interactive bioinformatics module for an intermediate genomics course that introduces bioinformatics to undergraduates and seeks to breakdown existing stereotypes of who can do this type of science through discussion and leading by example.

"This doctoral dissertation project will examine the evolutionary history of gelada monkeys (genus Theropithecus) based on skeletal and genetic data. Species of this group occur more broadly and in larger numbers than any other non-human primate in the fossil record of Africa. Fossils have been found in southern, eastern, and northern Africa, the Middle East, Spain, and even India, an unusual distribution for any primate group besides humans. The living representatives of this group, however, are only found in the highlands of Ethiopia. Because of their overlap with humans in the past, these monkeys have often been suggested as a model for understanding human evolution. Therefore, the in-depth analysis of gelada monkeys will not just provide better insight into the evolution of this group but will also advance the study of human evolution. This project will support graduate student training, and results from the project will be presented to the general public through the American Museum of Natural History Sackler Educational Laboratory's ""Meet the Scientist"" program.

The main goal of this project is to fully understand the evolutionary relationships, taxonomy and paleobiology of the primate genus Theropithecus. All available cranio-dental data for both living and extinct members of this group will be compiled. Morphometric data in the form of 3D landmarks and 2D measurements, as well as morphological data in the form of character states, will be collected. Genetic data will also be collected, thereby resulting in a large, integrated dataset for this primate group. This comprehensive dataset will then be used to: assess the morphological as well as genetic differences among the living populations of Theropithecus gelada; inform research on fossil populations; provide a comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction of the genus Theropithecus; investigate the dietary trends seen in this genus and their relationship to cranio-dental morphological trends; and investigate the cause of the extreme facial morphology exhibited by some species of this genus and evaluate whether that is related to diet, sexual selection or some other factor. As part of this study a new and relatively unknown population of an extant endemic primate will be analyzed and provide new insights for conservation purposes.

"Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Treponema pallidum subp. pallidum bacteria. It has recently reemerged as an urgent worldwide health crisis. The origin of the disease has been a mystery since its sudden appearance in Europe at the end of the 15th century and its subsequent rapid global spread. It has long been debated whether syphilis was introduced to Europe, perhaps from the Americas, or evolved from a form of treponemal infection that had been in Europe all along.  Graduate student Ziyu Wang and collaborators at The Pennsylvania State University will take a multi-faceted approach to investigate the pathogen's genetic diversity over the past 500 years in Europe to explore several possibilities to explain syphilis' origin in Europe. The current T. pallidum pathogens - associated with several related diseases - likely represent only the most successful or recently emerged genetic variants. Examined through an anthropological lens, ancient genomes when considered within the context of human sociocultural systems yield clues about the processes through which pathogens have achieved their evolutionary success. Ultimately a more informed understanding of the factors that contribute to the complex and dynamic interactions between humans and their pathogens provides a deep-time foundation for predicting the evolutionary trajectories of modern infectious pathogens and human responses. Today, as in the past, STI-related stigma has done much to interfere with the development and implementation of effective intervention programs. Lessons learned from historic epidemics and the public response will provide valuable tools for training healthcare professionals, STI high-risk groups, and the public.

To untangle syphilis' origin, its evolution, and its worldwide spread, the research team will sequence T. pallidum genomes from representative specimens sampled from temporally and socially well-characterized European skeletal assemblages dating to the 16th to 19th centuries. Ancient T. pallidum has previously not been well studied because of the limited ability of conventional genetic techniques (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) to recover highly-degraded ancient pathogen DNA. Here a sensitive targeted hybridization capture technique will be used to recover complete, or near-complete, ancient T. pallidum genomes. By comparing temporally known ancient pathogen genomes with their modern equivalents, the research team can track the sequential changes that occurred in the pathogen's genetic history. Doing so will narrow the possible evolutionary scenarios for the origin of syphilis and point to when the pathogen variant that causes syphilis first emerged.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,31972,1919662,ghp3@psu.edu,George,Perry,1,"Syphilis (caused by Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum; TPA) is a known sexually transmitted infection (STI) with a global distribution of approximately six million new cases annually. As a disease of great historical importance, the geographic origin of syphilis, in connection with its first recorded epidemic in Europe in 1495, has been at the center of a centuries-long debate. This was because the outbreak occurred at the beginning of a significant bidirectional exchange of humans, plants, animals, and microbes across the Atlantic. For centuries, the ""Columbian hypothesis"" claims that Columbus's crew introduced syphilis, a previously unknown disease, to Europe upon their return from the Americas in 1493. Alternatively, the pre-Columbian hypothesis argues that syphilis existed in Europe prior to Columbus. There are two nuanced views here, although both of them suggest an African origin for the disease. The first one, the Alternative hypothesis, pointed to the pathogen’s natural reservoirs found in wild non-human primates (NHPs) as a possible source, with the disease introduced to continental Europe through the slave trade prior to 1495. The second perspective (the Unitarian hypothesis) argues that the T. pallidum pathogen is ubiquitous around the globe. The pathogen spread with early Paleolithic human migrations out of Africa. Currently scientific data supporting these various narratives are limited. 

With 20th century medical knowledge, we now know that the precise causative agent of syphilis, TPA, is closely related to other T. pallidum subspecies of pertenue (TPE) and endemicum (TEN) that cause the endemic disease forms of yaws and bejel, respectively. These three diseases are collectively known as the human treponematoses. The pathogen subspecies of each disease form is morphologically and physiologically indistinguishable by microscopy or by serological tests of host antibodies. Healthcare professionals have to predominantly base their diagnoses on a careful consideration of clinical characteristics. However, the clinical manifestations of each disease form are highly variable, yet are strikingly similar to one another. Because of the overlap in clinical signs, diagnosis accuracy is frequently questioned, especially in regions where multiple treponematoses occur. Currently the precise identification of disease form by its responsible pathogen subspecies is only by molecular methods. 

Exactly which and how many forms of treponemal infection existed in Europe is currently unclear in historical documents and the archaeological record. Because syphilis is customarily known to be the only form of treponematosis that transmits sexually, it has been assumed that the bacterium responsible for the 1495 European epidemic is the same as, or has evolved into, TPA, the causative agent of modern syphilis. Although there are, at present, only a few such sequences, further work promises to clarify the evolutionary history of the treponemal diseases through a combination of ‘lost"" ancient T. pallidum genomes and paleopathological evidence.

To retrieve historical European T. pallidum genomes, we identified skeletal individuals with bony lesions consistent with the treponematoses in three large and well-characterized Danish archaeological skeletal assemblages: 1) Lindegarden, Ribe; (n=215; AD 1427-1805); 2) Gr&aring;br&oslash;dre, Svendborg (n=200; AD 1500-1600); and 3) Klosterkirken, Horsens (n= 221; AD 1750-1856). For a multi-stage paleogenomic study, we sampled teeth from individuals (&ge;15 years old) with (n=39) and without (n=11) skeletal lesions suggestive of treponemal infection. First, we screened metagenomic/shotgun sequences recovered from the teeth of these 50 individuals for genetic signatures of T. pallidum. Then, for 18 samples identified with putative T. pallidum DNA, we used a targeted whole genomic hybridization capture approach to enrich for T. pallidum DNA fragments prior to another round of sequencing. A novel ancient T. pallidum draft genome was identified in individual AG51 from the Gr&aring;br&oslash;dre cemetery in Svendborg, along with 17 samples of low-genome coverage. This newly reconstructed Danish ancient T. pallidum genome is phylogenetically placed within the TPE lineage. This indicates that TPE was an agent of treponematosis that existed in the once-living Danish community. This novel Danish TPE genome is closely related to all historical TPE genomes recovered from human remains dated to the 16th to 18th centuries. Our finding, when added to a growing body of ancient T. pallidum genomics evidence from the early modern Europe, suggests that the documented European ""syphilis"" epidemics starting in 1495, along with its subsequent global spread, might have been causes by multiple T. pallidum lineages, not just TPA. Drawing from multidisciplinary perspectives, we further suggest a complex evolutionary process of T. pallidum with a possible early origin from Africa and multiple dispersion events facilitated by human population movements throughout history.

"Fifty thousand years ago, modern humans dispersing out of Africa to Europe and Asia met now-extinct human relatives, such as Neanderthals, and interbred with them. As a result, genetic variation from Neanderthals exists in the human gene pool, but the effects of this variation on human biology are not well understood. In this doctoral dissertation project, the researcher will conduct a large-scale laboratory-based genetic experiment to test whether Neanderthal variants can affect the degree to which a gene is active in human immune cells. By identifying these variants and making publicly available the raw data from this experiment, the researchers will advance knowledge about the effects of evolutionary history and genetic variation on the immune system of living humans. Given that science news often features stories about Neanderthals, the researchers will utilize popular interest in this area to demonstrate the biological and medical relevance of studying human evolutionary history. They will also work with two museums to develop an exhibit that will additionally highlight the practical importance of this field of research. Furthermore, this project will help promote women in science given that the research will largely be undertaken by a female graduate student who is committed to training other women in science and has been active in the organization for Graduate Women in Science Engineering at her university. 

Although the last two decades have seen great strides in genetic research, because the specific function of most of the human genome is still unknown, researchers face difficulty when trying to connect most specific genetic mutations to their effect on biology. To aid in this discovery, datasets have been produced that allow correlations between the presence of genetic variation and biological phenotypes. However, because genetic variants near each other are often inherited together, it can be difficult to determine which genetic variant is responsible for the biological effect, limiting the ability to truly understand the mechanism. This is especially true in the case of Neanderthal genetic sequences present in living humans, which mostly lay in poorly understood parts of the genome that are thought generally to regulate the expression of genes. Nonetheless, correlational evidence suggests that this Neanderthal genetic variation may be affecting human immune system function. The researchers will conduct an experiment in which they simultaneously test thousands of Neanderthal genetic variants and their human counterparts for their ability to regulate the expression of genes in the immune system, in order to isolate the specific Neanderthal genetic variants that affect the biology of the human immune system. This will allow researchers to focus future work on specific functional testing of these important genetic variants.  Furthermore, by directly comparing correlational findings to the results in a laboratory experiment, this research will deepen the understanding of these commonly used genetic datasets.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Harvard University,MA,33433,1847287,tcapellini@fas.harvard.edu,Terence,Capellini,1,"As modern humans dispersed out of Africa between 130,000-50,000 years ago, they interbred with Neanderthals, resulting in a contribution of Neanderthal DNA into the human gene pool. This contribution today comprises ~2% of all non-African genomes. While much of this contribution was likely not important to human survival, a portion of it was important to survival and therefore was evolutionarily advantageous. Given that Neanderthals lived in ancient Eurasia about 200,000 years before modern humans entered it, Neanderthals likely acquired genetic adaptations to ancient environmental stressors, especially to specific pathogens that were unique to Europe and Asia. By breeding with these archaic Neanderthal ancestors, modern humans may have acquired DNA variants that helped them adapt to these new pathogens in ancient Eurasia. The human immune system was therefore likely affected by these new introgressed DNA sequences. However, the biological importance and function of this introgressed DNA sequence in present-day human cells remains unknown. Most of the sequences are found in non-coding DNA (regions that do not instruct direct protein building), and therefore it remains unknown what adaptive functional role each sequence served. Without knowing the function of this DNA, its biological consequence and potential adaptive benefit to human survival cannot be fully understood.
 
We approached this task using a series of different computational and functional analyses in the laboratory.  We first used computational methods to identify the DNA sequences in living humans that were introgressed from Neanderthals and have adaptively evolved in our ancestors. By using this approach, we identified approximately 60,000 DNA variants that reflect this ancient adaptive process and are present today in at least one of 20 modern human populations from around the world. This approach therefore allowed us to move away from only concentrating on variants present in Europeans, but to expand to many non-western populations.
 
However, this large number of variants (approximately 60,000) made it difficult and time-consuming to test each one, one-by-one, for some function. As a result, we used a new type of functional screen of these non-coding genetic variants, one that permitted us to test thousands of them for function simultaneously. This screen is called the Multiple Parallel Reporter Assay, and it is based on the premise that because these variants reside in non-coding sequences they likely fall in gene on/off switches that control whether a gene is used to build a protein. This is analogous to an on/off light switch in the house that turns on the light bulb (gene) in one room. The assay then assesses whether each DNA variant resides in and turns on the switch, but it does so by testing thousands at a time. We next tested this assay on approximately 10% of the sequences (5,353 variants). Given the importance of the human immune system for our ancestor's survival, we tested if the Neanderthal introgressed DNA variant altered on/off switch activity in two human immune cell lines (K562 and Jurkats). We identified that about 40% or 2,548 DNA variants do indeed reside in on/off switches. Moreover, we reduced the list of 5,353 to just 292 variants that then substantially modulate gene expression.
 
This work represents the first high-throughput screen directly targeted at Neanderthal introgressed DNA variants and reveals a set of identified (292) variants that can then be further examined for functionality in human cells and/or in vivo systems.  To then get a bit at direct function, we then used a form of DNA modification (called CRISPR-Cas9 editing) to remove a few of these variants from the genomes of human immune cells (in vitro) to see how they impact cell biology and gene expression. Overall, our findings provide substantial evidence that these 292 variants are important immune DNA on/off switches, and may be responsible for how human ancestors survived ancient pathogens in the new environments they entered upon leaving Africa. In addition, we pin-pointed several DNA variants acting as on/off switch modulators in a large DNA region that has been identified as being protective for COVID-19 illness. We also then found several DNA variants acting as on/off switch modulators in another large DNA region that has been identified as being a major risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness.
 
In the context of this investigation, our studies provided direct training for a female STEM scientist in human biology and computational biology. They also fostered the training of undergraduates in the tools of molecular biology and computational biology. These studies are currently being reviewed for publication in refereed journals, and the data will be used by immunologists and geneticists to help understand how DNA sequences aid in human survival. These data will also be incorporated into several museum exhibits to foster the understanding of human evolution, and how DNA sequences control human traits, including those involved in our ability to fight diseases.

"Human adaptations in diet and metabolism are likely to be linked to other important human traits, like our large, metabolically demanding brains. This doctoral dissertation project will study astrocytes, a type of metabolically important brain cell, to determine their contribution to the unique metabolism of the human brain. This work will further our understanding of evolved metabolic and neurological differences among primates, while providing insight into an understudied, but critical cell type of the brain at the cellular and genetic levels. This project will support the research of a first-generation female college and graduate student, as well as the development of public and K-12 science communication efforts largely focused on demystifying the genome and understanding the societal implications of readily accessible genomic data. 

Previous research has consistently shown enrichment of metabolic function in genes differentially expressed between the brains of several primate species. This proposal will investigate the evolution of gene expression and function in astrocytes, to understand the extent to which this cell type contributes to the unique metabolism of the human brain. The investigators will use established, non-invasive cell culture methods to grow and develop astrocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells of both humans and chimpanzees. These astrocytes will be assayed for differences in gene expression and traits important for metabolic function, such as glucose uptake into the cell.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Massachusetts Amherst,MA,31800,1846904,cbabbitt@bio.umass.edu,Courtney,Babbitt,1,"The human brain utilizes ~ 20% of all of the body’s metabolic resources, while chimpanzee brains use less than 10%. Although previous work shows significant differences in genes that are turned on or ""expressed"" between the brains of primates, we have yet to fully resolve the contribution of different brain cell types to these changes in brain function. To investigate cell-type specific interspecies differences in brain gene expression, we conducted RNA-Seq on neural progenitor cells (NPCs), neurons, and astrocytes generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from humans and chimpanzees. Interspecies differential expression (DE) analyses revealed that twice as many genes exhibit DE in astrocytes (12.2% of all genes expressed) than neurons (5.8%). Pathway enrichment analyses of catagories of genes determined that astrocytes, rather than neurons, diverged in expression of glucose and lactate transmembrane transport, as well as pyruvate processing and oxidative phosphorylation. These findings suggest that astrocytes may have contributed significantly to the evolution of greater brain glucose metabolism with proximity to humans.

Evolved differences in metabolic investment may be the basis for a number of primate-specific traits or ""phenotypes"", including those that are unique to humans, such as slow reproduction and growth and correspondingly longer lifespan than other placental mammals. Adaptation can act on metabolic phenotypes through alterations to energy budget including reductions of or increases in total energy budget or differential allocation of energy within energy budget.  Our results demonstrate that altered gene expression between species’ astrocytes - an under-studied, but critical brain cell type with known metabolic relevance, provide insight into the metabolic changes that were necessary to support evolution of the human brain.

This project supported the final chapeter of a first-generation college student in her Ph.D. at UMass Amherst and would not have been possible without NSF funding.

"This doctoral dissertation study will explore an important aspect of teeth and their role in dietary ecology, by testing the ability of tooth enamel to resist fracture and wear from forces applied during chewing. Tooth enamel from different primate species will be imaged and mechanically tested using methods from materials science engineering to better understand the relationship between the internal structure of teeth and their performance. The results of this study will illustrate the mechanisms that allow teeth to chew tough and hard foods, which may inform research to develop stronger replacements for worn and broken teeth, as well as research to better reconstruct the diet of extinct humans and animals. The study will support graduate student training and the development of undergraduate laboratory coursework that emphasizes the use of concepts from dental biology and anthropology in engineering applications.	

This study will address how the form of enamel contributes to its function in resisting tooth failure. At micro- and nanometer scales, enamel is formed out of many small crystals that are bundled together in complex patterns. These patterns are thought to help teeth resist wear by aligning crystals in a direction where they are strongest in response to abrasion. Additionally, a highly complex pattern of interwoven crystals is believed to help prevent cracks from moving through enamel and leading to a chipped or cracked tooth. This study combines ion beam microscopy to image micro- and nanometer structures of enamel in fine detail, and indentation methods from material science engineering to determine how enamel structures respond when forces are applied. To understand how these structures function in human teeth, the variation in their properties will be compared with those of other closely related species. For this reason, the analytical sample includes teeth from humans and a range of non-human primates including chimpanzees and baboons. Ultimately, this study will strengthen the inferences that can be made when determining diet from fossils in our evolutionary past, and help to illustrate how and why teeth break.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Rutgers University New Brunswick,NJ,15151,1847941,robertsc@scarletmail.rutgers.edu,Robert,Scott,1,"Teeth represent an important line of evidence in biological anthropology because they interact directly with foods during chewing and because they preserve well in fossil record. This makes teeth invaluable as tools to infer diet and adaptation in our living primate relatives and fossil ancestor. The goal of this project was to examine signals of dietary adaptation in the enamel layer covering the molar teeth of primates that can be used to infer diet in fossil species. The project used methods from the material sciences to map the physical and chemical properties in the enamel of 22 molar teeth from 10 different primate species. The goals of this project were broken into two objectives: 1) to determine how the properties of tooth enamel vary within and across the molar crown of primates, and 2) to identify the underlying adaptations responsible for this variation, in the chemistry and structure of the enamel itself. The results help us to understand how teeth work to chew foods over long periods without failure in animals that eat diverse diets that include very hard and tough objects.

 

The first goal of this project was studied using nanoindetation, which mapped the mechanical properties (hardness and stiffness) in the enamel layer of each tooth in the sample. Tooth enamel is well-suited to breaking down foods during chewing because of it has high hardness and stiffness compared to other biological tissues. However, under the wrong circumstances, teeth can fail due to fracture and wear resulting in poor chewing performance and creating pathways for infection. A major outcome of this project was to show how hardness and stiffness change throughout the enamel layer in the molar teeth of primates, in ways that help their teeth resist fracture and wear. Furthermore, the evidence suggested that hardness and stiffness vary across species in a manner associated with their dietary behavior. These findings illustrated adaptations in primate tooth enamel that were inherited from their common mammalian ancestor, but also possible adaptations within lineages that rely on mechanically challenging diets.

 

The second goal of this project was studied using electron microprobe analysis and high-magnification microscopy. The electron microprobe was used to map changes in the chemical structure of enamel in the teeth and in the same locations where mechanical properties were mapped. This yielded the most complete database yet assembled on the mechanical properties and enamel chemistry of primate tooth enamel. The enamel chemistry data provided several possible explanations for the changes in hardness and stiffness in the enamel of primate teeth. These included the finding that hardness and stiffness were significantly correlated with changes in the relative amount of protein that remains in primate tooth enamel after it grows and mineralizes during development. The inclusion of trace elements within primate tooth enamel was also implicated as a factor in the variation of hardness and stiffness in primate enamel. Microscopy was used to examine the underlying mineral structure of the enamel layer, which takes the form of small mineral crystallites packed together in long prisms that ultimately build the crown of the tooth. Here, the hardness and stiffness of enamel was related to the density of these prisms, suggesting an important signal of adaptation lies in the behavior of enamel-producing cells during tooth development.

 

In addition to providing the largest dataset on the physical and chemical properties of primate teeth, this project has illuminated new and important adaptations related to the function and resilience of the enamel layer our closest living relatives. This information is essential for research that develops methods to repair, regenerate, or replace enamel; the only hard tissue in the mammalian body that cannot do so on its own.

"In many mammals, male characteristics and behaviors may limit female mate choice.  Discrepancies between observed mate choice and actual paternity suggest, however, that females may exert influence over offspring paternity through physiological preference. This doctoral dissertation project will explore how genetics and physiology influence primate mate choice, generating novel data on primate reproductive physiology. The project also will provide mentorship and training in field, laboratory, bioinformatics and statistical methods for students from groups under-represented in STEM fields.

This study will explore physiological mechanisms by which olive baboons may exert post-breeding mate choice. The co-PI will collect reproductive physiological data for both males and females. Social behaviors will also be recorded to investigate the concordance between pre- and post-breeding choice. This study will improve understanding of post-breeding mechanisms of choice in primates and inform the broader primate comparative context for understanding the unique suite of reproductive and morphological characteristics seen in humans.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,New York University,NY,25200,1826804,jhigham@nyu.edu,James,Higham,1,"Many of the beautiful colors and courtship behaviors observed in species of birds and fish have been attributed to female mate choice, however comparatively little is known about the effects of female mate choice in mammals. In some species, large male body size and sexual coercion may limit the ability of females to mate with only preferred partners, and therefore females may engage in more cryptic mechanisms to influence paternity. Recent evidence of cryptic female mate choice has begun to accumulate in non-human primates, such as discrepancies between mating observations and paternity, however there is a dearth of information on how such cryptic mechanisms may operate. Genetic characteristics, both genome-wide and at a region of the genome specific to immune function, have proven to be informative in predicting paternity and behavioral mate choice in primates, however these studies often find it impossible to tease apart male- versus female-driven processes, as well as those occurring before, during, or after copulation.

 

The present study aimed to explore mechanisms of female-driven mate choice occurring both before and after copulation in a non-human primate, the olive baboon.  Our study had two specific aims:

 

1)      describe changes in the vaginal environment across the ovarian cycle in the absence of mating, and following copulation with males with different genetic characteristics

2)      characterize female sexual signaling and behavior in relation to the male genetic characteristics

 

To accomplish these aims, we first sequenced the DNA of 22 captive olive baboons living at le Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Primate Center in Rousset, France. We sequenced short segments of DNA interspersed throughout the genome, as well as an area specific to immune function, known to be relevant to mate choice through its effects on body odor. We then formulated 4 study groups, and from these groups collected a broad range of data types, including behavioral data, pictures of females’ sexual swellings (i.e. the swelling of the ano-genital skin which advertises fertility), vaginal pH measurements, and vaginal swabs used to determine the female’s ovarian cycle phase and their vaginal gene expression. Vaginal pH and gene expression were assessed because of their potential effects on sperm survival within the vagina. Low vaginal pH inhibits sperm survival, and vaginal gene expression has the potential to influence the immune response mounted by the female in response to the ejaculate, also influencing sperm survival.  Both of these parameters may influence which sperm are successful, and thereby which males father offspring, providing potential mechanisms of cryptic female mate choice. 

 

Following data collection, we then compared the genetic profile of each individual, as well as the genetic complementarity (e.g. similarity) between mating dyads, to rates of sexual behavior, the timing of sexual swellings, and changes in vaginal pH and gene expression both before and following copulation.  Publications are forthcoming, and will include:

1)      Concordance between genetic variability and complementarity genome-wide and at areas specific to immune function in the olive baboon.

2)      How genetic variability and complementarity influence rates of social and sexual behavior in the olive baboon.

3)      The accuracy with which female sexual swellings predict ovulation in this population, specifically when females are housed with males possessing differing amounts of genetic variability and complementarity.

4)      Olive baboon vaginal pH and gene expression throughout the different phases of the ovarian cycle.

5)      Changes in olive baboon vaginal pH and gene expression in response to mating with males possessing different degrees of genetic variability and complementarity.

 

This research greatly improves to our understanding of female reproductive strategies in olive baboons, a species that is closely related to humans and an excellent model for understanding processes related to mate choice in humans. For example, approximately 30% of human infertility is due to unknown reasons, and improving our knowledge of the male/female interface early in reproduction in a closely related species has the potential to improve fertility treatments and clarify unexplained infertility issues in humans. Additionally, this research provided training in behavioral data collection, laboratory, and statistical analyses for multiple students from different areas of the United States and abroad. The images and videos collected throughout this research project will be used to introduce topics in biological anthropology to grade-school children through guest lectures, such as those already undertaken by the Co-PI at the Denver. Furthermore, these datasets will be used to provide conference presentation experience for multiple early career-stage scientists and all data will be made publicly available online after publication.

"Adverse environmental conditions during growth and development can affect physiological function and well-being later in life. This dissertation project will investigate, in a primate model system, whether early-life adversity in primate mothers additionally influences traits in their offspring. Using longitudinal and newly collected data for a natural population of long-lived primates allows researchers to investigate intergenerational effects that may inform evolutionary theory and human health research without having to obtain multi-generation life history data from humans. The project will support international research collaborations, public and K-12 science outreach, and scientific training and mentoring for students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. 

The Amboseli baboons have been under near-daily observation since 1971, resulting in extensive longitudinal demographic, environmental, and behavioral data. The investigators will use these existing data in conjunction with newly collected data on maternal care to test the hypothesis that mothers who experienced adversity during their developmental period provide relatively low quality maternal care to their offspring, leading to deficits in offspring survival. The research will therefore advance knowledge about proximate mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of stress.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Duke University,NC,28800,1826215,alberts@duke.edu,Susan,Alberts,1,"The goal of this award was to understand whether and how the negative impacts of adverse early life experiences are passed on from one generation to the next in wild primates.

First, we leveraged long-term demographic data that has been collected from a population of wild baboons (the Amboseli baboons) for more 50 years to ask whether offspring were less likely to survive if their mothers had experienced early adversity, years or even decades previously. As predicted, we found that offspring were less likely to survive their juvenile periods if their mothers had experienced either early maternal loss or a competing younger sibling in early life. This result was the first to demonstrate that there are intergenerational fitness effects of early adversity in a wild long-lived animal.

We followed this first analysis in baboons with a cross-species analysis using comparable data from 7 species of wild primates to ask whether intergenerational effects of early maternal loss are common in primates. We replicated our results from baboons in blue monkeys and muriquis, and found ambiguous evidence for the same results in chimpanzees (more data needed). Thus, the inheritance of intergenerational fitness effects of early life adversity appear to be a common occurrence in wild primates.

Our final goal was to try to identify the mechanisms by which the intergenerational effect that we observed in baboons comes about. The large majority of the intergenerational effect that we observed in baboons took place in the first year of the affected offspring's life. The first year is the approximate period of infancy, and offspring are almost completely dependent on their mother during this year, especially the earlier months. This is also a period of rapid social development, with infants' receiving social inputs from a large number of both related and unrelated group mates. We therefore hypothesized that the intergenerational effects of early adversity resulted from differences in either the maternal care or social development that these offspring experience.

To test this hypothesis, we developed a detailed behavioral protocol that allowed us to measure many components of the mother-infant relationship as well as social development in baboon infants. Between 2018 and 2021, we made three trips to Amboseli National Park in Kenya to collect behavioral data from pairs of baboon mothers and infants. Because of the long-term nature (50 years) of the Amboseli project, we knew the early adversity experienced by the living mothers in our population and targeted particular mother-infant pairs to achieve a balance of mothers that had experienced varying levels of early adversity.

To give a sense of what data collection looked like, one of us (the Co-PI or a field assistant) would stand approximately 10 meters away from a mother baboon and her infant and make careful observations. For 45 minutes at a time, we would record a range of metrics every minute, on the minute, such as how far apart the mother and infant were, what they were doing, and whether the infant was on the nipple. We also recorded other behaviors each time that they occurred, such as positive or negative interactions between the infant and other individuals and each time the mother or infant made or broke contact with each other. In total, we collected more than 600 hours of data from 62 mother-infant pairs during three field seasons from 2018 to 2021. Analysis of the data from this final behavioral project is ongoing and will conclude in 2022.

In addition to the academic advances made with this award, we also achieved several broader impacts. First, this award allowed two aspiring female scientists to travel to Kenya as field assistants and collect behavioral data from wild baboons for several months at a time, an intense and uncommon research experience. Both of these field assistants are now pursuing graduate degrees in their respective fields. Second, during the period of this award the Co-PI has developed two projects for enhancing the dissemination of research results within the field of animal behavior. The first is a virtual seminar series called the Long-Term Animal Research Seminar Series, a series that he co-hosted on YouTube to explore the unique insights made possible by long-term research. He hosted 60 speakers from 2020-2021, including more than 30 graduate students and postdocs, and videos from the seminar have been viewed more than 12000 times. The second is The Animal Behavior Podcast, a show that he co-hosts in which he has conversations with established animal behavior researchers about their work, scientific journeys, and the state of the field of animal behavior. Season 1 of the podcast ran June-October 2021, and the ten episodes of the first season have already been downloaded more than 10000 times.

"The problem of sorting human skeletal remains is encountered in bioarchaeological and forensic settings where the bones of multiple individuals are intermingled with no readily apparent indication as to which bone elements belong to which individual. Anthropologists use bone measurements to compare and match bones to single individuals, but current methods do not adequately account for the size and shape relationships between bones. This research project incorporates information on comparative bone morphology to create an automated sorting method. The expected product of this project will be a novel method that improves upon standard techniques, which would reduce the cost and increase the quality of results for bioarchaeological and forensic research. Sorting human remains is essential for aiding and streamlining medicolegal cases in the aftermath of mass fatalities and for returning deceased individuals to their loved ones. The project contributes to the training of a female graduate student with a strong commitment to diverse, inclusive science outreach efforts, and results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals, as well as presented at academic conferences.

This project applies multivariate analyses of bilateral asymmetry and allometry to address the problem of osteometric sorting. Large data sets of bone measurements from archaeological and recent human populations will be evaluated to determine and characterize patterns of asymmetry and allometry in humans. Based on this information, novel methods will be developed for the sorting of mixed skeletal elements using bone measurements (osteometric sorting). This work will be done using the statistical and graphics package R, based on multivariate algorithms, such as Mahalanobis distance. This project will generate useful information about the morphological relationships between skeletal elements across different human populations and will result in the creation of an improved method for osteometric sorting.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,IL,6828,1825402,lylek@illinois.edu,Lyle,Konigsberg,1,"The size and shape of a limb bone relative to another bone holds a great amount of information needed to individualize a commingled assemblage. This study maximizes discriminating information found in long bone measurements with multivariate analyses of allometry and asymmetry. Previous research on osteometric sorting are univariate in nature and often make fallacious assumptions of perfect symmetry in long bones. These methods have led to issues of specious statistical assumptions and high error rates in application.

            For this project, we examined measures and applications of human limb bone asymmetry and allometry in order to improve current methods for individuating commingled human remains. Patterns of asymmetry and allometry were characterized using large data sets (n &gt; 2,000 people) of bone measurements from diverse populations. Based on this information, these patterns were used to develop novel methods in R for the sorting of mixed skeletal elements using multivariate metrics.

            There are three sets of results for this study. First, the distributional assumptions of previous sorting algorithms were questioned and re-assessed. Through statistical analysis, we characterized the true distributional forms of human limb asymmetry as exponential power distributions. These findings represent the first characterization of asymmetry distributions. Second, we produced and evaluated an automated method for osteometric pair-matching using bilateral limb asymmetry in R. We conducted multiple trials comparing the diagnostic abilities of this method against previous pair-matching algorithms. The results from the new method show an improvement in performance over the other current tests for the humerus and radius, a match in performance for the femur, and underperformance for the tibia. Third, we created and tested an automated method for osteometric sorting that can match several different bones at once. Since there are currently no automated techniques for the matching of more than two bones at a time, this new method was not compared to any other algorithm and the statistics for diagnostic accuracy are presented alone. The results of this study demonstrate that the matching of more than two bones at a time reduces the amount of potential bone combinations that need to be assessed by-hand from hundreds of thousands to more manageable numbers. In total, these data suggest that the incorporation of multivariate statistics in osteometric sorting can improve the diagnostic ability of automated methods and demonstrate the feasibility of the application of research in real world-contexts.

            In the context of this study, we have presented preliminary data at the meetings of the American Association of Physical Anthropology and to undergraduates and researchers at various institutions. This grant has contributed to the education of a doctoral student. In addition, she mentored and facilitated the work of undergraduate researchers. The work will be presented at the 2020 American Association of Physical Anthropology meetings.

"The way that an animal species behaves, moves, and interacts with its environment is related in complex ways to the shape and function of its skeleton. Investigating the functional relationships among different parts of the skeleton, and the genetic underpinnings of functionally related traits, can advance fundamental knowledge about form-function relationships and mechanisms of biological adaptation and speciation. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the strength of the genetic connections among functionally related traits in the primate shoulder, head, and neck regions, to elucidate processes that led to the substantial anatomical diversity we see in modern primates, and inform our interpretations of the primate and hominin fossil records. The project promotes participation of under-represented groups in STEM research, interdisciplinary research and collaboration, and the sharing of data with the broader scientific community. The results of this project will be communicated to the public through both traditional and online science outreach activities. 

Primates show a wide range of variation in shoulder anatomy and, relatedly, engage in diverse forms of movement. Researchers often study these skeletal traits in isolation, but this approach makes the implicit assumption that traits evolved independently, when in fact there may be other traits in the upper body that are functionally and evolutionarily interconnected with the shoulder. This study examines the many patterns of association in shoulder-related skeletal dimensions across ten primate taxa, each with unique functional demands on the upper limb. The investigators will evaluate different evolutionary scenarios of species diversification to identify underlying evolutionary processes. The strength of the genetic connections among traits (morphological integration) and how these connections affect the ability of traits to evolve (evolvability) will be assessed, and Bayesian phylogenetic comparative methods will be used to evaluate the factors and evolutionary processes affecting the observable variation in primate shoulder morphology.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Tennessee Knoxville,TN,16125,1825995,auerbach@utk.edu,Benjamin,Auerbach,1,"In this project, the PI and co-PI examined different potential mechanisms that influenced the evolution of morphology (shape) in bones comprising human and non-human primate shoulders. The shape of the primate shoulder has been thought to reflect adaptations associated with the wide range of environments they inhabit. Previous study results indicate that the morphology of the bones comprising the shoulder girdle, especially the scapula, reflect the functional demands of the upper limb. Therefore, the shape of the scapula is often hypothesized to reflect adaptations to specific functions related to locomotion, resource acquisition (diet), or habitat. 

 

Researchers in prior studies have proposed evolutionary mechanisms to explain the observed patterns of shoulder bone shapes, they have not tested these mechanisms against explicit evolutionary models. These researchers have suggested that traits used in similar functions or that undergo similar developmental processes, or both, have the potential to also share responses to selection. The shape of the scapula, for example, shares both developmental and functional relationships with traits of the pelvis (hip bones) and the base of the skull (basicranium). Yet, the scapula is often studied by itself. This inherently ignores the functional and developmental connections it has with other anatomical regions; these interconnections have potential to affect the response of the scapula to evolutionary forces. Specifically, the scapula may have shared responses with other anatomical regions to natural selection.

 

Given this background, the PI and co-PI examined three hypotheses: 1) The ability of the shoulder girdle to respond to selection is influenced by other anatomical regions&mdash;the base of the skull, the pelvis, and the upper arm&mdash;with which it shares developmental and functional relationships. 2) Primates with different shoulder girdle morphologies, which are associated with both variation in locomotion and evolutionary history, will have different potentials for shared responses to selection with these other anatomical regions. 3) No single hypothesized factor, such as locomotion, diet, or habitat, fully explains the evolutionary causes for observed variation in the primate shoulder girdle. 

 

The PI and co-PI therefore investigated different mechanisms that can affect how the primate shoulder girdle responds to selection. Results of the research indicate multiple overlapping factors that contribute to variation in the primate shoulder girdle. The scapula has not evolved independent of other anatomical regions. The ability of the skeletal traits in the primate shoulder to respond to the pressure of selection is constrained by the basicranium, pelvic girdle, and to a lesser degree, the humerus. Moreover, the strength of the underlying functional, developmental, and genetic relationships among the shoulder girdle, basicranium, pelvic girdle, and humerus are not the same among all primates. Primate shoulder variation reflects these relationships and their effect on the ability of the traits in the shoulder girdle to respond to selection independently. The results of the study provide a strong caution that hypotheses about the evolution of shoulder girdle variation need to include those anatomical regions that share functional and developmental relationships with it in order to more accurately reflect the evolution of this anatomical region.

 

This study has successfully examined novel data and yielded new findings about the evolution of primates. No other primate study has examined both cranial and post-cranial traits at the same time in an evolutionary context. This is because the skull has previously been thought to have a different evolutionary history from the rest of the body. The project also set out to demonstrate the utility of under-utilized analytical methods (quantitative genetic and phylogenetic comparative methods) in the field of anthropology, and by doing so, to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers using similar methods. Additionally, the study set out to train and foster the early career of a graduate student from an underrepresented group in the field of anthropology.

 

The outcomes of this research are being presented to the wider academic community. Preliminary study results were presented at the annual meetings for the American Association for Anatomy, the American Association of Physical Anthropologists, the International Society for Evolution, Medicine &amp; Public Health (ISEMPH), and the 2019 Annual Postdoc Symposium at Indiana University School of Medicine. Elizabeth Agosto, co-PI, gave podium presentations at the anatomy meetings (April 2018), the physical anthropology meetings (April 2019), and at IUSM (October 2019), and a total of four posters were presented across the anatomy meetings, physical anthropology meetings, and ISEMPH (August 2019). The study is presented in full in Elizabeth Agosto's dissertation. Three manuscripts based on this dissertation are currently being prepared for publication. Each paper presents the general findings of the research in relation to each of the three hypotheses summarized above.

"While increased population density and the growth of cities are often thought to be important sources of social and economic opportunity, the potential negative effects of urbanization can sometimes harm human health.  In living societies, increasing settlement and population density can be accompanied by greater exposure and susceptibility to dangerous infectious diseases, social inequality, unsanitary living conditions, and unstable food supplies.  Paleodemography; the study of human populations in the archaeological past based on skeletal remains - can provide important insights into the complex relationships between people, their social and physical environments, and their diseases even in the absence of written historical records.  This project will investigate the effects of urbanization on human health and the risk of death in medieval Denmark (c. AD 1050-1536) to disentangle the social and biological influences on human health in changing populations.  In paleodemography, ""frailty"" is defined as an individual's age-adjusted risk of death.  Frailty can vary owing to individual differences in susceptibility to disease and death that may have underlying genetic, social, or environmental causes.  New statistical analyses of skeletal samples from medieval Denmark will be used to determine how patterns of variation in frailty and risk of death in the past differed as a result of increased urbanization during the medieval period.  This project will inform us about the role of urbanization in past preindustrial populations that dealt with the same illnesses and conditions that continue to influence people today, and as such will provide insight into how to avoid emerging health risks.  Broader impacts of this study include museum exhibitions, public science outreach efforts (particularly aimed at promoting the role of women in scientific research), and continued international collaborations.

This dissertation project brings together established paleodemographic approaches and a new model of frailty, along with newly-developed statistical methods, to investigate the relationship between childhood and adult frailty and the risk of death from skeletal data in order to determine the effects of urbanization on age-at-death distributions from medieval Denmark.  Skeletal remains from the Ole Wormsgade urban cemetery, Sejet rural parish cemetery, and the monastic cemetery of Om Kloster, which represent samples of the people who occupied the area in and near the medieval port city of Horsens on the eastern coast of Jutland, Denmark, will be examined.  These samples will be analyzed to determine: (1) how frailty and age-at-death patterns differed as a result of urbanization over the medieval period, (2) how males and females were affected differently by their social and physical environments within and across the three samples, and (3) what the relationship was between childhood frailty and resulting adult frailty and mortality.  These goals will be met by estimating disease prevalence and the associated risk of death in relation to boney indicators of childhood stress, infection, and malnutrition.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,13734,1825362,jww3@psu.edu,James,Wood,1,"While cities are often the seats of cultural, economic, and technological advancement, modern health research suggests that urbanization has negative consequences on human health. However, the relationship between urbanization and patterns of health in past populations are less understood because urbanization is a relatively recent demographic phenomenon in human history. To understand the effects of urbanization on past populations, bioarchaeologists examine skeletal remains to reconstruct and interpret patterns of mortality and frailty (susceptibility of death and disease) as proxies for health. This research examined the effects of urbanization during the Danish medieval period (AD 1050-1536), a time characterized by dramatic transitional changes, in the northeastern Jutland region through the analysis of 634 skeletons from an urban cemetery in the city of Horsens (Ole Wormsgade), a rural parish cemetery (Sejet), a rural monastic cemetery (&Oslash;m Kloster), and an early, pre-urbanization (c. 1050-1250) rural parish (Nordby). Skeletal indicators of frailty (e.g. lesions resulting from chronic disease and stress) and patterns of mortality were used as proxies of health. Data on burial position was gathered and applied as a relative chronological aging method to examine patterns across the medieval period.

The results suggest that, among historical populations, the relationship between urbanization and community health was likely more affected by local conditions than general trends. Specifically, these results inform on how urban and neighboring rural communities may have been differently influenced by the transmission of infectious diseases in light of shifting social and ecological conditions. Analysis of leprosy showed that Ole Wormsgade had the highest prevalence when compared to rural Sejet and &Oslash;m Kloster; however, the inclusion of a comparative urban sample from the Ribe Grey Friary in western Jutland showed that Ribe had the lowest prevalence of leprosy. Historical evidence may explain this observed difference in the two urban communities. The establishment of leprosaria (leprosy hospitals) in medieval Denmark would have led to the selective exclusion of people with visible signs of leprosy. The city of Ribe had maintained a leprosarium throughout the medieval period, whereas the city of Horsens did not establish a leprosarium until much later. The selection process of removing individuals with stigmatizing lesions in Ribe would have resulted in a lower frequency of leprosy compared to that of Ole Wormsgade in Horsens. This study also observed that there was a higher prevalence of tuberculosis in all cemeteries compared to leprosy, especially in rural Sejet. The overall higher prevalence of tuberculosis may indicate shifting disease dynamics over the medieval period, as leprosy gradually died out, possibly as a result of leprosaria, while tuberculosis prevalence increased. Rural villages like Sejet may have been more exposed to tuberculosis strains of infection through contact with infected cattle compared to urban areas where fresh milk was less accessible. Overall, the frequencies varied, although not significantly, indicating that there was considerable overlap in contact and lifestyle in medieval Danish urban and rural communities.

The results show that urban and rural communities and their subpopulations did not experience equal mortality risk. Cemetery comparisons of survivorship and hazard analysis revealed some significant differences between the four sites with Sejet, the rural parish, having the lowest average age at death followed by the rural site of &Oslash;m Kloster. These findings are contrary to the proposed hypothesis and suggest that there may be other conflating factors influencing the observed patterns. Among females, there were no strong differences in mortality and survivorship; however, it was observed that females buried at Sejet and &Oslash;m Kloster continued to show higher hazard rates than females buried at Ole Wormsgade and Nordby. The overall pattern may indicate that women in rural environments were enduring greater risks, especially during the childbearing years. Overall, the mortality patterns observed in these analyses suggest that there are differences between the sampled sites, although it is uncertain that these differences resulted from an urban-rural distinction. Lastly, the hazard analysis results indicate that individuals who died with arm position B (c. 1200-1400) experienced a higher mortality risk. This result may be correlated to the fact that this portion of the medieval period experienced several notable climatic and catastrophic events that would have influenced mortality risk (e.g. the Black Death and the Great Famine).

The current and pending results of this project will continue to be presented at national and international conferences, as well as at invited speaking arrangements. Results from this project have been published in peer-reviewed journals, and the statistical methods used are being made accessible through online repositories. This project contributed to the training of a first-generation female graduate student in a STEM field in paleoepidemiological methods and statistical programming. Finally, these results contribute to the growing body of research examining the effects of urbanization in past populations and propose improved paleodemographic models to examine the nuances of these effects in archaeological samples.

"Beyond conventional genetic inheritance, mothers can impact their offspring's biology through the transfer of immune factors, epigenetic markers, and beneficial microbes. Another lesser-known, non-conventional mode of inheritance is called microchimerism, whereby cells travel between mother and baby during pregnancy, and some colonize and persist for decades after birth. This doctoral dissertation project leverages data from a multigenerational, longitudinal health and nutrition study to investigate microchimerism as a mediating factor in immune tradeoffs throughout the life course. The research aims to better understand how microchimerism may be associated with fetal growth during pregnancy, infant feeding practices, early childhood infectious disease, and pregnancy outcomes in adults. The publicly available data from this longitudinal study and the newly-generated microchimerism data will provide opportunities for student-driven research for undergraduates, including individuals from underrepresented groups.

Microchimerism is thought to influence host immune function by directly contributing stem cells that differentiate and develop into functional immune cells and expressing foreign antigens that trigger host immune responses. Most microchimerism research has focused on relationships with autoimmune disorders, cancer, transplant biology, and adverse pregnancy outcomes, leaving considerable gaps in understanding why some individuals are colonized by microchimeric cells more than others, and how these differences might impact evolutionary fitness. To clarify these issues, population-based data from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey spanning three generations of participants will be used to investigate the following specific aims: 1) evaluate whether having been breastfed in infancy predicts microchimerism in adulthood, 2) assess whether microchimerism is associated with lower risk of early life infection, and 3) determine whether adult women with microchimerism from their mothers have lower risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes as they have offspring of their own.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Washington,WA,30988,1751388,dtae@uw.edu,Daniel,Eisenberg,1,"Beyond conventional genetic inheritance, mothers can impact their offspring?s biology and health through the transfer of immune factors, epigenetic marks, and beneficial microbes. We examined a lesser-studied non-conventional mode of inheritance&mdash;microchimerism. During pregnancy, cells travel between mother and baby, and some engraft and persist for decades after birth. This retention of a small number of cells from another individual is termed microchimerism. Past research on microchimerism has largely focused on the long term health of mothers and immune disorders that affect young children. However, each life stage (gestation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood) faces different tradeoffs to immune function. This project leveraged survey and birth weight data from a multigenerational, longitudinal health and nutrition study and introduced microchimerism as a mediating factor in immune tradeoffs throughout the life course. We conducted laboratory analyses on DNA samples collected from mother-daughter pairs to quantify maternal-origin microchimerism in the daughters. These new microchimerism data along with existing demographic and health data allowed us to investigate the following questions:

1)      What factors predict transmission of maternal-origin microchimerism and its persistence into adulthood?

2)      Is maternal-origin microchimerism associated with a protective effect against early life infectious disease symptoms?

3)      Do women with microchimerism from their mothers have lower risk of negative pregnancy outcomes as they have offspring of their own?

For question 1, we examined four potential determinants of maternal-origin microchimerism: 1) duration of pregnancy as a measure of how long daughters were exposed to maternal cells and DNA prenatally; 2) duration of breastfeeding as a measure of how long daughters were exposed to maternal cells and DNA in early life; 3) maternal telomere length as a measure of maternal cells? ability to replicate and persist in the daughter; and 4) number of children the daughter has had as microchimerism analysis was conducted in blood samples collected in adulthood, and pregnancy can introduce fetal-origin microchimerism and impact immune function in ways that may alter the quantity of detectable maternal-origin microchimerism. Our findings demonstrate that, controlling for other potential determinants, having a history of being breastfed was associated with decreased maternal-origin microchimerism in adulthood. This is contrary to our initial prediction based on experimental mouse studies that indicated breastmilk as a postpartum route of maternal cell transfer to offspring and human organ transplantation studies that showed increased immune tolerance of maternal grafts with history of being breastfed. A possible explanation for our finding is that daughters who were breastfed have immune systems that are better able to get rid of genetically foreign cells. As a result, it is possible that our tests for microchimerism were not detecting viable immune cells in the blood, but rather cell-free DNA shed from dead cells in other tissues and released into the blood stream. Analyses for questions 2 and 3 are ongoing.

"Diverse species worldwide are endangered because of habitat loss and increased exposure to human activities. Research is needed that moves beyond the current focus on protected areas to other human-modified landscapes to determine how wildlife and humans can coexist. This doctoral dissertation project combines behavioral, ecological, demographic, and genetic data from an endangered lemur species that lives in a landscape shared with humans, to assess how this species is affected by human activities. In addition to furthering knowledge about human-lemur dynamics, the project will provide a model for wildlife biologists and managers of protected areas to investigate human-wildlife dynamics more generally. As part of this project, investigators will train students in field and laboratory techniques, including behavioral data collection, wildlife surveys, and DNA extraction and amplification. Further, the project will contribute to public science outreach, international research collaborations, and primate conservation. 

The investigators will conduct a fine-scale analysis of the impacts of human activities on the ecology of the Verreaux's sifaka, including how this lemur species responds to disturbances and which types of human activities are most threatening. Behavioral, demographic, and geographic data will be collected for sifakas living in areas subject to differing degrees of human disturbance. These investigations will be focused at Bezà Mahafaly Special Reserve, a recently expanded protected area in southwest Madagascar that includes core conservation areas as well as areas of regulated human use. At a larger landscape scale, investigators will survey unprotected forest fragments in the Bezà region and conduct landscape genetic analyses, using fecal DNA. These analyses will determine how sifakas move across the human-dominated landscape and how the structure of the sifaka population is influenced by patterns of human land use. Finally, investigators will combine long-term demographic data from the core sifaka population at Bezà with data on sifaka movement into and out of the reserve to predict the population's future growth and stability.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Yale University,CT,25001,1745371,david.watts@yale.edu,David,Watts,1,"This study investigated how human activities are impacting a critically endangered primate, Propithecus verreauxi (or sifaka). To this end, we collected data on human activities as well as sifaka behavior, distribution, and genetics across multiple spatial scales to assess the impact of humans on individual sifakas, sifaka groups, and the population as a whole. Our research was based at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve (BMSR), a multiple-use community-based conservation area, and the surrounding Betioky Sud region in southwest Madagascar. Specifically, we recorded the types and frequencies of human activities occurring within three different management zones at BMSR in conjunction with detailed behavioral data on sifakas to determine if any human activities are perceived as threats to the sifakas. Second, we conducted transect surveys across a larger area of BMSR during which we recorded presence of sifakas as well as freshly cut trees (as a sign of recent human use) to assess the impacts of human activities on patterns of sifaka distribution. Lastly, we surveyed five forest fragments outside BMSR for sifakas, collected fecal samples from 91 individuals (plus &gt;28 from BMSR), and amplified microsatellite genetic markers. I used these genetic data to conduct a landscape genetics analysis to assess the degree to which the sifaka population is structured in relation to patterns of human land use/alteration.

 

Overall, our results indicate minimal negative impacts of current human activities on sifakas at BMSR and suggest hope for human-lemur coexistence. Specifically, we found that, at BMSR, sifakas alter their behavior in the short term in response to certain human-related activities--most notably the presence of domestic dogs and livestock--but not to others. None of the anthropogenic activities, however, had a discernable effect on the sifakas overall activity budget. In addition, we found that sifaka density was not inversely related to intensity of human use; in fact, the relationship was positive, with areas of greater human use tending to also have more sifakas. Importantly, even the areas of highest use recorded at BMSR are not modified extensively and maintain sufficient food and shelter for sifakas. Taken together these results suggest that the ways people are currently using the BMSR forest are not having lasting negative impacts on the sifakas and speak to the overall effectiveness of the BMSR multiple-use management plan in achieving sifaka conservation goals.

 

At the regional scale, we identified several important and previously unstudied sifaka habitat areas in forests managed at the local level by community forest associations. Forest loss within the region has been extensive over the last seventy years and connections between sifaka sites are now minimal, if they exist at all. However, our genetic analyses indicate a high degree of admixture within the population. Given the time lag between when changes to population structure occur and when they can be detected from allele frequencies, gene flow in the sifaka population is very likely currently restricted due to human land use patterns. That said, there is no evidence that genetic diversity within the population has been lost. Expanded conservation efforts and reforestation programs have the potential to maintain genetic diversity and admixture within the population moving forward.

 

This project underscores the importance of multiple-use community-based conservation areas in the protection of a critically endangered primate species and highlights potential for human-wildlife coexistence. The project can serve as a model for how to assess human impacts on a wildlife population using a holistic and multi-tiered approach. The results of this work have already helped inform new conservation efforts to protect sifakas and improve forest connectivity in the Betioky Sud region.

 

This project contributed to international research collaborations and provided training for multiple Malagasy and American students in field, laboratory, and analytical methods. We have shared the results of our research at national and international conferences, in peer-reviewed journal articles, and to conservation stakeholders in the Betioky Sud region.

"As a biological species, humans continue to adapt genetically to various environments through natural selection. However, cultural and lifestyle changes occur much more rapidly than those biological changes, leading in some cases to a mismatch between our biology and our modern life. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how past differences in the food resources of two populations (foragers vs. agropastoralists) may have led to different genetic adaptations in metabolism, and how those adaptations may relate to modern-day well-being and chronic conditions. The investigator hypothesizes that past genetic adaptations to domesticated foodstuffs could result in fewer chronic health problems when a population transitions to a modern diet and lifestyle.  The study will contribute to our understanding of the role of diet in human evolution and adaptation, and its effects on well-being in contemporary populations. Genetic, epidemiological and cultural data from Amerindian individuals, which are crucial for understanding the role of genomic variants in modern well-being among admixed populations, will be shared with participants and stakeholders as well as the scientific community. This investigation will include individuals from underrepresented groups as both research participants and researchers, build and strengthen international research collaborations, and contribute to student training at the graduate and undergraduate levels. 

Grounded in the literature of human biology, nutritional and molecular anthropology, and evolutionary medicine, the proposed research aims to (1) evaluate whether genomic regions involved in nutrient metabolism have been differentially targeted by selection in two post-nutrition transition Amerindian populations with contrasting histories of subsistence strategies (hunting-gathering vs. agropastoralism) and (2) evaluate whether these signatures are subsistence-specific and correspond to the prevalence of several chronic condition risk biomarkers. The question arises as to whether relatively recent dietary shifts have had evolutionary consequences for human populations, and to what extent these are related to the rise in chronic conditions in post-nutrition transition populations. This study will include two Amerindian populations:  one that until recently engaged in hunting-gathering in the temperate forest, and the other that has been long engaged in agropastoralism in a desert environment. The research design will comprise ethnographic fieldwork including oral history interviews, dietary and physical activity surveys, measurements of blood and anthropometric chronic condition risk biomarkers, and genome-wide scans for selection.",NSF,Indiana University,IN,15194,1752114,wileya@indiana.edu,Andrea,Wiley,1,"The overarching goal of this project is to evaluate whether histories of different subsistence strategies (hunting-gathering vs. agropastoralism) among two populations have resulted in different genetic adaptations in metabolism and how these relate to the prevalence of chronic diseases on each after controlling for diet and physical activity.

 The funding requested to the NSF correspond to the Phase 1 and 2 of this project (February-August 2018), which encompass building rapport with the communities, participants recruitment and data collection at the two field sites. In order to achieve this goal, we held meetings with community leaders, and participated in the monthly community meeting where we explained and discussed this project with the potential participants. In the phase 1 we conducted and recorded 20 interviews on each field site to understand the drivers and characteristics of the food change in the last 50-20 years, applied a questionnaire to understand the dietary transitions, and participated in the community's everyday activities -including traditional ceremonies and meetings, and recruited ~200 non-related individuals for the phase 2. On phase 2, we were able to engage 190 participants that completed food-frequency and physical activity questionnaires, and measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, body-fat percentage, waist circumference, blood biomarkers (total-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose), and saliva for DNA analyses were collected.

 Preliminary analysis of the interviews and questionnaires on the dietary transition show that at both field sites, processed foods began to be incorporated in the early 80s and were known by then by the majority of the interviewees; however, these did not become staple foods until the mid-90s or later. The mechanisms through which recent food change occurred among these communities are quite similar despite the very different ecological contexts. According to the participants, the primary driver of this change was the introduction of big mining and logging companies, in the desert and forest, respectively. Their activities required to improve the road infrastructure, connecting the rural with the urban areas where processed foods are produced, and brought wage-earning employment, accelerating the abandonment of traditional subsistence strategies.

 Preliminary statistical analysis of the biomarker data show that blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, waist circumference, and blood biomarkers are not significantly different between the two populations. When data is categorized into two groups of cardiovascular risk (at -risk and not-at-risk) for each variable, there is a higher frequency of at-risk individuals among the agropastoralist population for one of these biomarkers and no differences for the others.

 So far, the results of this study suggest that risk for chronic conditions does not differ between the two populations, countering the prediction that populations long-subsisting on hunting-gathering would have a higher risk of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemias. Further analyses including diet and physical activity data, along with genetic markers (phase 3), need to be included to evaluate the relationship between dietary adaptations and disease risk.

 The co-PI gave a talk at a University in Chile presenting the work conducted on Phase 1 and 2 at a local university (Universidad de Chile) and co-authored a book chapter on the cultural changes and continuities of the small-scale agriculture system of the Atacama Desert (in press). Further publications of scientific articles and data will be available upon the completion of phase 3 (genomic analyses).

 The co-PI mentored 8 senior female undergraduate students in Chile who assisted during data collection. These students received training in bioethics, and ethnographic and human biology methods, including anthropometrics, blood and saliva sampling, among others.

"This project will create a comprehensive, open-access database of plant and animal demographic information that will be useful to researchers, educators, and conservation managers. No such centralized repository currently exists, although biologists have been collecting data on the rates with which individuals survive, grow, and reproduce for many decades, and from tens of thousands of populations around the world. These fundamental biological data can inform a range of scientific research within and outside of the field of biology, including understanding why certain populations go extinct or become invasive, and predicting how species may respond to anthropogenic pressures and global change. By developing a single, standardized platform for storing and analyzing these demographic data, this project will yield an important resource for a range of users. For example, researchers will be able to directly contribute their datasets into the repository, as well as to link these demographic data with other databases (e.g. on species distributions, genetic sequences, climate projections) to conduct large-scale comparative studies. Teachers and students will be able to explore variations in life cycles and carry out basic analyses by following the exercises and tutorials that will accompany the database. Finally, managers of threatened species can use these demographic data to better understand the needs of their populations and compare the impacts of different management strategies (e.g., increasing breeding compared to increasing offspring survival). 

The demographic rates of survival, growth, and reproduction are the basic units for measuring how populations change in size and structure through time and space. As such, these demographic data serve as key resources for a range of biological research, from understanding the evolution of life histories to predicting species responses to global change. Moreover, demographic studies tend to follow a standardized protocol for data collection and presentation in the form of matrix population models (MPMs). This standardization provides a rare opportunity to conduct large-scale comparative analyses across the tree of life. The scientific literature currently contains MPMs for >1,500 plant species and >2,000 animal species worldwide, often with several populations for each species. The distinctive data structure and standardized analyses for MPMs necessitate a uniform, centralized repository to maximize the utility of these valuable data. This project aims to develop an open-access repository of MPMs, which will allow researchers to leverage decades of demographic monitoring to conduct comparative analyses at global, regional, and local scales. The proposed work involves developing a robust relational database management system for MPMs, building upon existing efforts by an international team of demographic experts and data users on the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and COMADRE Animal Matrix Database. The team will create a publicly accessible interface to facilitate data usage and enable researchers to directly contribute their MPM datasets through a standardized data entry portal. Additionally, the project's senior personnel will develop tutorials and teaching materials, and conduct a series of workshops to engage current and potential users of the repository including researchers, educators, and conservation managers.

Building upon a decades-long international effort, we combined the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database into a single relational database with a multi-functional interface to facilitate data access by a broad range of users including researchers, students, and conservation managers (Image 1). New features include querying the database by taxonomic or publication information (Image 2), visualizing data by geographic location, and downloading either single matrices in .csv format or the full dataset in a format compatible with the R software for further analysis. The database will now publish quarterly releases of the full dataset as we continue to update and error-check the matrix values and associated metadata. We built a standardized data entry portal, so that our international team of students and scientists can work together to systematically compile new data (Image 3). The data digitization portal also allows other researchers to directly contribute their own matrix models into the database via a dashboard (Image 4), and the website provides a permanent link to archive data from their publication(s). We also developed a suite of education materials aimed at the high school and college levels to teach about species life histories as well as the use and construction of matrix populations models. Finally, we presented a series of 7 workshops at scientific conferences, and published blogs and newsletters to engage and expand our user base. Overall, our project has greatly improved the consistency, accessibility, and function of our global demographic dataset, creating a valuable resource for a variety of users and forming the foundation for novel research from understanding the evolution of life histories to predicting species responses to global change.

"Female mate choice in primates is sometimes overshadowed by studies of male-male contest competition as the predominant selective pressure influencing patterns of reproductive behaviors in primates. This doctoral dissertation project will explore female mate choice in wild woolly monkeys, a group-living Neotropical primate, where female choice is hypothesized to be a particularly important form of selection. The proposed study represents one of the first investigations of female reproductive strategies in Neotropical primates from an explicitly female choice perspective. It will include evaluation of female behavioral variation in relation to fertility status, expanding our knowledge of the biology of female choice and providing a comparative primate model for mate choice in hominins.  This project will support research training and mentoring of U.S. students, development of international collaborations, public science outreach, and primate conservation efforts.

Research on patterns of primate reproductive behavior often focuses on male strategies such as male-male contest competition and female coercion, with less attention to female mate choice. In primate species with low male-male contest competition and low male-to-female aggression, such as woolly monkeys, females mating decisions may be less constrained than in other primate taxa, and females may have more opportunity to actively choose their mates. This project will specifically examine how changes in fertility and likelihood of conception across females' reproductive cycles affect their rate of copulation, partner number and identity, and directing of mating-related behavior towards males. Using a combination of behavioral, endocrinological, and genetic methods, the researchers will study four groups of woolly monkeys in the wild. The project will explore whether female choice for particular males depends upon (1) male physical traits, (2) male-female affiliative relationships, (3) MHC dissimilarity, and (4) degree of genetic relatedness, and will examine whether these preferences vary according to cyclical changes in the ovarian hormones that determine female fertility. Ultimately, the results from this work may provide new insight into how mating systems are shaped by female decisions and behavior.",NSF,University of Texas at Austin,TX,24163,1732326,anthony.difiore@austin.utexas.edu,Anthony,Di Fiore,1,"We examined female mating strategies in a population of woolly monkeys at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station in Amazonian Ecuador, focusing on the potential for female mate choice in shaping social interactions within and between the sexes. Using field observations of behavior, along with endocrinological and genetic methods in the lab, we have been studying whether females' choices of mating partners depends upon male physical traits (e.g., male body size), male-female affiliative relationships, and the degree of  relatedness between mating pairs, and have been examine whether these preferences vary according to cyclical changes in the ovarian hormones that determine female fertility. In addition, we have conducted parentage analyses to determine how genetic paternity relates to male mating behavior, male physical traits, and patterns of male-female affiliation.

Over the course of two field seasons (August to December of 2016, and August of 2017 to February of 2018) that coincided with woolly monkeys? mating seasons, we collected 835 hours of behavioral observation, 661 fecal samples for hormonal analysis, and 432 samples for genetic analyses. We observed a total of 167 mating events, and in general, all adult females were observed copulating with multiple mating partners, including adult and subadult males of different ages and body sizes. We constructed genotypes for 138 individuals from our focal and neighboring groups and completed parentage analyses to determine the most likely dam and sire for nearly all infants born in 4 social groups of monkeys between 2012 and 2017 (~50 total). We also conducted enzyme immunoassays to quantify progesterone and estrone metabolites from the fecal samples collected during both field seasons.

Paternity analyses revealed that male reproductive skew was variable across groups, but it was evident that -- at the group level -- male reproductive patterns were influenced by particulars of group composition. Woolly monkeys groups typically contain multiple adult  males, usually with one of them being conspicuously larger and distinguished by his exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics. Males, nonetheless, are typically tolerant to one another (even in sexual contexts), and there seems to be no clear dominance hierarchy among males within a group. We observed females in all groups mating with multiple males of different age categories and body sizes, but one of our most interesting results from our paternity analyses is that, whenever present (in 3 of our study groups), the ?large? adult male in a group sired approximately ~62% of the infants born into his group during the study, despite the fact these males only accounted for ~18% of all the copulations observed. Contrastingly, in the one group that did not contain a conspicuously larger male, paternity results revealed very low reproductive skew among males. That is, our results suggest that despite having a promiscuous mating system, lacking clear dominance hierarchies, and showing male tolerance to one another in mating contexts, woolly monkeys still manifest strong male reproductive skew towards ?large? adult males, when present.

We suggest that male reproductive skew may be influenced by female choice for ?large? males during their peak fertile period, but in groups where male residency is unstable and there are no ?large? adult males present, female choice may not coalesce around a single individual. We are still analyzing the results from our endocrinological analyses to determine whether in fact females are choosing to mate with these large adult males around the time of ovulation, while mating with other males outside of their fertility window.

Thus far, this project has supported seven young scientists from the US and Ecuador who received extensive training and practice in behavioral and ecological data collection, animal tracking using radio telemetry, fecal sample collection for DNA and hormone analyses, database management, and GIS software and analysis. Additionally, our lab has trained a young female high school student to aid in the processing and analysis of genetic data, as part of a collaboration between Crockett High School in Austin and the Integrative Biology Department at the University of Texas at Austin. This student intern assisted in genotyping DNA samples from our wild primate subjects, using polymerase chain reaction-based microsatellite marker typing. Additionally, co-PI Abondano has supervised the honors thesis of an undergraduate student from Colombia who is using the data collected on scent-marking behaviors observed during our two field seasons (and as part of our longer-term project on woolly monkeys at at the same site). Preliminary results from our study have already been presented to fellow anthropologists at academic conferences at both the national (American Association of Physical Anthropologists and American Society of Primatologists) and international level (International Primatological Society).

"Humans are long-lived compared with other mammals, including our closest living biological relatives, the chimpanzees. Yet the genetic and physiological bases of our remarkable longevity, as well as the processes underlying human aging, remain poorly understood. This project uses a comparative molecular approach to elucidate the unique human pattern of aging and long life by comparing the genetic regulatory changes that occur with age in chimpanzees with those observed in humans. Specifically, researchers will investigate the chemical alterations to DNA called methylation. Methylation is proving to be an important mechanism, via the adjustment of gene expression levels, in the control of temporal biological processes, including development and potentially aging. Results of this project will allow for the identification of genes that are differently regulated with age in the two species and thereby help identify which physiological mechanisms (for example, DNA damage repair or immune function) play critical roles specifically in human survival to advanced ages. This project has important current relevance because human populations are aging demographically at an unprecedented rate, and the need to manage and treat age-related medical issues is rapidly growing. This project will contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students in laboratory and analytical techniques and will relay results related to aging to members of the public through free educational programming.

A growing body of recent research demonstrates a strong pattern of change in methylation levels at sites across the genome with age in humans that are so predictable that they can be used to estimate individual chronological age. Moreover, slight deviations among individuals in ""methylation age"" seem to reflect biological aging: elevated methylation age is associated with mortality risk, increased frailty, decreased grip strength and lung function, diminished cognitive performance, and increased cancer and cardiovascular disease risk. Thus, methylation age represents a valuable new approach for measuring biological aging, identifying factors that influence aging rate, and potentially uncovering the genetic regulatory changes that underlie physiological aging. The current study will generate genome-wide methylomes from 100 chimpanzee DNA samples collected from individuals aged 0 to 59 and identify which sites show changes in methylation levels with age. These data will be compared with existing human datasets to discover differences in the methylome landscape and methylation aging rate between the two species. Thus, this project extends the study of methylation age to a cross-species comparative context to illuminate the evolution of fundamental differences in life history between humans and other primates.",NSF,Yale University,CT,25200,1733896,david.watts@yale.edu,David,Watts,1,"This project aimed to assess how humans and chimpanzees might differ in patterns of epigenetic aging. To this end, we generated genome-wide blood methylation data for 113 samples from 83 chimpanzees aged 1-58 years (26 chimpanzees were sampled at multiple ages during their lifespan). From this data, we first built a predictive ""epigenetic clock"" model specific to chimpanzees that predicts chimapanzee age with high accuracy. This clock is comprised of 80 CpG sites, many of which are associated with genes involved in development. The chimpanzee clock shows little overlap with previously built human clocks. We next undertook a broader comparison between chimpanzees and humans in which sites in the genome show epigenetic change with age. We identified over 150,000 sites in the chimpanzee genome that showed significant change in methylation with age, around one-third of which also showed significant age-related change in humans. Genes associated with CpG sites showing age-related change in methylation fell in many of the same broad categories in both species, including cell cycle regulation, immune system function, and development, in particular of the nervous system. We also identified &gt;100 genes that showed change in only one of the two species and are thus promising candidates for further study to identify potential molecular underpinnings of species-specific aspects of aging.

Overall, we found that chimpanzees, at least in our study group, show less variation in epigenetic aging among individuals than humans do, which may reflect the diversity of human lifestyles and environments.

"In primate reproductive ecology, the role of energy as a constraint on reproduction has often focused on females. Yet across mammals, including humans, male reproductive effort can often entail substantial metabolic costs. This doctoral dissertation project will examine how energy constrains male behavior and reproduction in a wild primate, the gelada monkey. The project will provide insight into how animal physiology and reproductive efforts adjust to natural ecological change, and examine how testosterone, a regulatory mechanism for male reproductive behavior, may be directly limited by energy. By examining the effects of energetics on the allocation of testosterone-mediated reproductive effort in a nonhuman primate, this project will shed light on the selective pressures and potential influence of energetics in shaping non-human primate and hominin species. Through the course of this research, the Co-PI will provide training in lab-based behavioral endocrinology techniques for undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. In addition, the Co-PI will conduct science education and conservation outreach at various domestic and international venues.

This project will study wild gelada monkeys as a model to examine the relationship between male energetic condition, physiology, and male quality as assessed from vocal and visual signals used in male-male competition. Towards this end, this project will combine classic behavioral observations with innovative methods in (1) digital photogrammetry to assess male chest patch coloration, and (2) endocrinology to determine energetic condition from non-invasively collected urine and fecal samples. The polygynous mating system of gelada monkeys provides an ideal model to investigate contrasts in male reproductive energetics: harem-holding gelada leader males sire the vast majority of offspring while bachelor males in all-male groups lack reproductive opportunities. Reproductive success is therefore heavily skewed towards gelada leader males, and bachelors must overthrow a leader during energetically challenging ""takeover"" events to gain reproductive access to females. This research will evaluate the underlying seasonal variation in male energetic condition, how this variation relates to male social status, and whether energetic condition ultimately constrains testosterone-dependent signaling and male reproductive strategies. Although ample evidence suggests that lower food availability and energy may constrain male reproductive physiology, a comprehensive picture of the interrelationship between testosterone, energy, and reproduction in male primates is needed. This research will be one of the first to assess how energy may be a limiting factor for male reproductive success in wild primates.",NSF,SUNY at Stony Brook,NY,26402,1732231,amy.lu@stonybrook.edu,Amy,Lu,1,"In mammals, male reproductive success is expected to be primarily limited by access to females. Studies of male-male competition have therefore traditionally focused on behavioral strategies and reproductive benefits, neglecting the energetic costs incurred. Yet male primates often engage in physically demanding behaviors to maintain and/or acquire reproductive opportunities which may come at an energetic cost. This doctoral dissertation project examined how energy constrains male behavior and reproduction in a wild primate, the gelada monkey. The project provides insight into how animal physiology and reproductive efforts adjust to natural ecological change, and examines whether testosterone, a regulatory mechanism for male reproductive behavior, may be directly limited by energy.

This research combined classic behavioral observations with innovative methods in endocrinology to determine energetic condition from non-invasively collected urine and fecal samples. We evaluated the underlying seasonal variation in male energetic condition, how this variation relates to male social status, and whether energetic condition ultimately constrains testosterone-dependent signaling and male reproduction.

Energetic condition was assessed via a urinary biomarker (C-peptide), which has rarely been applied to questions in the context of reproductive competition. The application of these innovative methods greatly expands our knowledge of the effects of energetics on reproduction, and more broadly can be applied to identify the impact of seasonal changes on physiology and to inform conservation efforts. Importantly, the data generated here increase our understanding of how environmental factors impact gelada behavior and ecology. Currently, the gelada habitat is being eroded as a result of agricultural expansion, making these data critical for devising appropriate conservation plans.

Since geladas are grass-eating primates, we expected low energetic status (low C-peptide) when grass was less available in the dry season. Contrary to predictions, C-peptide levels were higher during the dry season suggesting that geladas experienced improved energetic condition when grass was less available. Gelada diets are nearly 100% above-ground plant parts in the wet season, but geladas switch to consuming more belowground plant parts (specifically underground storage organs) during drier months when grass is less available. This suggests a nutritional advantage of these foods compared to grass-eating, despite their relative inaccessibility belowground.

Outside of studies of wild animals, these results have exciting implications for the potential influence of energetics in shaping primate and human evolution. Human ancestors likely inhabited landscapes that were characterized by drier, more seasonal habitats where they depended heavily on grassland-based resources. Evidence suggests that seasonal reliance on underground storage organs may have played a crucial dietary role. As the only living graminivorous primate today, geladas provide a unique perspective for understanding the energetic consequences of a grassland-based diet.

The polygynous mating system of geladas provides an ideal model to investigate contrasts in male reproductive energetics: gelada leader males sire the vast majority of offspring in reproductive units, while bachelor males in all-male groups lack reproductive opportunities. Reproductive success is therefore heavily skewed towards leader males, and bachelors must overthrow a leader during energetically challenging ""takeover"" events to gain reproductive access to females. We found that compared to leader males, bachelor males engaged in little to no mating behavior, less aggression, and rested more, particularly during the dry season. Bachelors also had higher energetic status (higher C-peptide) than leaders during the dry season, which suggests that maintaining reproductive access comes with energetic challenges for male geladas. Higher fecal testosterone concentrations were not linked to energetic status but to higher temperatures, which supports previous work suggesting geladas experience thermoregulatory challenges since they live in high-altitude, cold habitats.

Through the course of the research, this project provided opportunities for training and science education as well as conservation outreach at various domestic and international venues. Five Ethiopian field assistants were involved in data collection as part of the Simien Mountains Gelada Research Project (SMGRP) and were trained in new techniques specific to this study. With this training, these individuals are able to pursue degrees and/or careers in biology, park management, and wildlife conservation. As part of the SMGRP, RFP was involved in several local projects to increase community awareness and conservation efforts. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority, she offered seminars to ecotourism guides and local park rangers providing up-to-date knowledge about gelada biology and behavior to increase protection of this species and other fauna and flora in national park. Upon returning from the field, RFP mentored three undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. Through experiential learning internships, students received training in lab-based behavioral endocrinology and digital photogrammetry techniques. In addition to labwork and data processing, the students also honed their critical thinking and communication skills during weekly lab meetings and were given the opportunity to pursue their interest in the study of biological anthropology.

"Dramatic increases in cranial capacity have occurred in hominins. These shifts in relative brain size are hypothesized to have caused (1) alterations to the modern human skull and (2) delays or reductions in somatic growth that may affect skull development. While prior studies have used fossil or comparative primate data to understand the relationship between the brain and skull, this project utilizes an experimental approach to link the process of encephalization with specific changes in skull morphology. The results of this project will be incorporated into multiple educational and outreach activities designed to stimulate interest in younger students pursuing STEM fields and careers, particularly young women, and foster awareness of the interdisciplinary potential for biological anthropology. Through the Penn State Expanding Your Horizons STEM Career Day for Women and the ScienceU Pre-Med Expo, the researchers will help students understand the morphological changes that have occurred in the human skull over time, including the specific impact of encephalization.

This project uses the BAF170 murine model with a known genetic variant that results in an enlarged brain phenotype. The BAF170 gene is knocked-out only in cortical tissue resulting in an enlarged cortex, such that any changes in the skull can only be attributed to the effect of the larger cortex. Using high-resolution micro-computed tomography data of prenatal and early postnatal skull development, this research will test whether an increase in relative brain size affects somatic growth of the skull or causes changes in cranial development or eventual morphology. Experiments are designed to determine whether the change in brain size causes changes in: (1) the timing of the appearance/formation of cranial ossification centers during embryological development; (2) cranial bone quality, evaluated by quantifying bone volume and bone density; or (3) morphology of the cranial base, cranial vault, or facial skeleton that can be compared with similar changes seen through time in hominins. These experiments will test the spatial packing hypothesis and the expensive brain hypothesis, by examining the relationship between brain size and cranial base angle and between changes in brain size and somatic ontogenetic trajectories. The resulting data will provide experimental evidence pertaining to the relationship between encephalization in hominins and changes in skull morphology and growth producing the unique human skull phenotype.",NSF,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,31418,1731909,jta10@psu.edu,Joan,Richtsmeier,1,"Dramatic changes in cranial capacity have characterized human evolution. Beyond the cognitive developments of critical thinking and reasoning that such a change might bring, evolutionary hypotheses assert that shifts in relative brain size have caused (1) alterations to the modern human skull and (2) delays or reductions in somatic growth that may affect skull development. While prior studies have used fossil or comparative primate data to understand the relationship between the brain and skull, this project has laid the foundation for future work that will utilize an experimental approach to link the process of encephalization with specific changes in skull morphology and provide insights into the evolution of the modern human skull. The results of this project have been incorporated into multiple educational and outreach activities designed to stimulate interest in younger students pursuing STEM fields and careers, particularly young women, and foster awareness of the interdisciplinary potential for biological anthropology. Through the Penn State Expanding Your Horizons STEM Career Day for Women and the ScienceU Pre-Med Expo, the researchers have used this project to help students understand the morphological changes that have occurred in the human skull throughout evolution, including the specific impact of encephalization. Additionally, this project has provided research and publication opportunities for multiple undergraduate students, including four women.


 The outcomes of this project include furthering our understanding human encephalization, methods that enable the visualization of soft tissue structures such as the brain at high resolution using micro-computed tomography (microCT), and baseline data on standard laboratory mice for cranial bone density and volume over ontogenetic time. A number of evolutionary hypotheses assert that increases in relative brain size (encephalization) have caused alterations to the modern human skull, including a domed cranial vault, highly flexed cranial base, and retracted facial skeleton. In Lesciotto &amp; Richtsmeier 2019 (Yearbook of Physical Anthropology), we argue that understanding this relationship between encephalization and human skull morphology requires the direct testing of hypotheses relating to the interaction of embryonic development of the bones of the skull and the brain. Accomplishing this type of experimental approach will require methods for the visualization and quantification of the developing brain and skull at high resolution. Our method for utilizing phosphotunstic acid to differentially stain cranial soft tissue structures prior to microCT scanning accomplishes this task. However, prior to using experimental mouse models to test our hypotheses regarding the effects of encephalization, we have to understand the morphology and development of the brain and skull in unperturbed laboratory mice. A common strain of mouse, C57BL/6J, was used to establish normative data for cranial bone density and volume, which will act as a comparative dataset to evaluate any deviations detected in future research using experimental mouse models of encephalization.

"Compared to the living apes, humans are notably different in having relatively short arms and long legs, which is functionally related to our unique, two-legged gait (bipedalism) and life on the ground. To better understand hominin locomotor evolution, researchers want to know when and how bipedalism affected other aspects of hominin mobility. In this dissertation project, the student co-PI will compare aspects of climbing performance in humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas to see how a range of body sizes and limb proportions affects climbing ability. The research has broad implications for understanding human evolution, movement and mechanics. Understanding more about climbing performance can also address how to limit climbing injuries, assess risk, and design technology for both sport and military climbing pursuits. This project will also support graduate student training, and science outreach to groups underrepresented in STEM fields and to local communities and athletes. 

The objective of this study is to establish the effects of limb proportions and body size on the climbing performance of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas by assessing three aspects of climbing performance: energetic cost, fatigue, and canopy access. The co-PI will collect behavioral locomotor data in sympatric human, chimpanzee, and gorilla populations in Nouabale-Ndoki National Park, Republic of Congo, and in human rock climbers, to control for environmental variation and observe a range of size and proportion variation. Whether, and to what extent, hominins were arboreal continues to be debated, and, more specifically, the relative prominence of vertical climbing in the locomotor repertoires of various hominin taxa remains an issue. This study will result in a more comprehensive understanding of the form/function relationship for climbing, and enable the assessment of how selection for bipedal adaptations affected climbing abilities during human evolution. It may also improve assessments of the ecology of fossil taxa.",NSF,CUNY Hunter College,NY,9828,1732194,pontzer@gmail.com,Herman,Pontzer,1,"Many human populations regularly climb trees, but their arboreal positional behavior is not well studied. Adaptations to terrestrial bipedalism are generally thought to limit arboreal behavior in humans and their ancestors as compared to living apes.

For this project, we tested whether and how humans and apes differ in arboreal ecology, using a comparative data set of human positional behavior in trees compared with chimpanzees and gorillas in northern Republic of Congo. Data were collected during full day follows. At two-minute intervals we recorded a subject?s position, height, support diameter, and location within the tree. The sample consisted of P. troglodytes troglodytes (22 individuals), G. gorilla gorilla (19 individuals;), and indigenous Mbenjele men (17 individuals). Among key results we find that: 1) In trees, humans spend significantly more time standing bipedally than apes; 2) humans spend significantly more time in the core region near the main trunk (as opposed to the peripheral branches) than apes; and 3) minimum support diameter is not significantly different in humans and other apes. These data suggest humans use trees differently than apes but are nonetheless adept in an arboreal environment and capable of foraging in the canopy. These results have implications for understanding the ecology and evolution of living apes, indigenous peoples, and  humans ancestors.

            In the context of this study, we presented preliminary data to local children and researchers in the Republic of Congo and a climbing gym in the US. This grant has contributed to the education of a doctoral student. In addition, she worked directly with Congolese researchers and contributed to their training and ongoing research collaboration between the United States and the Republic of Congo.

"The human tongue and hyoid bone have been extensively studied for their role in the evolution of speech. Some researchers hypothesize that our unique tongue and hyoid morphology also makes us more prone to choking. This research uses advanced imaging techniques and computational modeling to test whether human hyolingual morphology is beneficial or detrimental for swallowing. While this research focuses on swallowing function in an evolutionary context, the findings of this research will also advance our understanding of normal swallowing mechanisms and therefore may have clinical applications. The software for the computational model generated by this project will be made freely available upon completion. This project provides mentored research not only to a woman in science but specifically one studying biomechanics, a field in which women are underrepresented. Furthermore, the project will support undergraduate research and training for a diverse group of students at the University of Chicago.

The short faces and low tongue, hyoid, and larynx of humans have been argued to be adapted for speech and maladapted for swallowing. Recent studies cast doubt on both of these claims, prompting further exploration of alternative hypotheses to explain the origin of the uniquely human hyolingual apparatus. This project tests the hypothesis that hyolingual biomechanics constrain morphology, specifically that a low hyolingual apparatus is necessary to maintain swallowing performance as the face becomes shorter. X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM), diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced CT (diceCT), and electromyography (EMG) will be used to obtain high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo measurements of bone, tongue, and muscle biomechanics, including hyolingual muscle length, velocity, and activity in a primate model system. These data will then be used to validate a computational model of the impacts on swallowing biomechanics and performance of variation in hyolingual position, and craniofacial morphology. Falsification of the constraint hypothesis would provide indirect support for the hypothesis that the morphology of the human vocal tract is the result of natural selection for speech performance. This project will inform future research on how the functional requirements of the hyolingual apparatus may have influenced the morphology of surrounding structures, e.g., the mandibular symphysis, in both extant and extinct taxa.",NSF,University of Chicago,IL,21974,1732175,rossc@uchicago.edu,Callum,Ross,1,"Swallowing is essential to vertebrate life, yet its biomechanical basis is poorly understood compared to other behaviors such as chewing, suction feeding, reaching, and locomotion. Human swallowing biomechanics is of clinical interest for treating dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, with neuromuscular rehabilitation. Swallowing is also of anthropological interest because purported adaptations for speech also allow food and air to mingle near an open larynx, which some argue renders humans maladapted to swallowing. However, this hypothesis has not been thoroughly tested and in fact is refuted by several studies of human feeding physiology. This dissertation research uses a macaque (Macaca mulatta) model system to determine the biomechanical basis of two important movements involved in bolus propulsion and airway protection&mdash;tongue base retraction and hyoid superoanterior excursion&mdash;and examines how changes in hyolingual and craniofacial morphology over the course of human evolution and ontogeny affect hyolingual biomechanics. Tongue base retraction was caused by neither extrinsic lingual muscle shortening nor hydrostatic deformation. Kinematic evidence suggests that suprahyoid muscles cause tongue base retraction by regionally changing tongue volume, which is consistent with a hydraulic linkage between the suprahyoid muscles and the tongue. These suprahyoid muscles not only actively shorten during tongue base retraction, but they also rotate as they move the hyoid. This rotation either amplifies or reduces hyoid velocity depending on the geometry of the muscle and the direction of rotation. In this way, suprahyoid muscles are functionally analogous to pennate muscles, which also exhibit fiber rotation and gearing. A computational model of hyoid range of motion validated against in vivo data demonstrates that hyoid descent&mdash;which is commonly assumed to be detrimental to swallowing&mdash;may actually help to maintain swallowing performance as the human face has shortened in recent evolutionary history, especially if tongue volume must be preserved to maintain a hydraulic linkage between the tongue and hyoid. Moreover, because mandibular morphology affects suprahyoid muscle length, selective pressure to maintain swallowing performance may have resulted in the emergence of humanity’s characteristic vertical mandibular symphysis and chin. However, geometric constraints require human suprahyoid muscles to shorten relatively more when the hyoid is descended, which may leave humans vulnerable to dysphagia not because the human airway allows for more mixing of food and air near the larynx but rather because of fundamental constraints on vertebrate skeletal muscle biomechanics. Given that muscles from the cranium, mandible, pharynx, soft palate, larynx, sternum, and scapula all converge on this nexus of the neck, the mammalian hyolingual apparatus may have an underappreciated role in shaping the structures from which it is so elegantly suspended.  

This project provided mentored research not only to women in science but specifically those studying biomechanics, a field in which women are underrepresented. The methodologies generated by this project can be used to generate further knowledge on how the functional requirements of the hyolingual apparatus may have influenced the morphology of surrounding structures, e.g., the mandibular symphysis, in both extant and extinct taxa.

"The goal of this research is to understand the relationship between the shape of the neck bones (cervical vertebrae) and how they function in humans and our living relatives. The co-PI will address this question by comparing the shape of the bones to both the movement of the spine during walking and its maximum ranges of motion in living lemurs and apes. The relationships between spinal form and function established in this study have implications for both anthropological and medical fields. Spine research often uses non-human primates as models for spinal injury and treatment without understanding the functional differences that may exist between humans and their living relatives. This research will have implications for the appropriateness of non-human primates in spinal medical research. In addition, this lab-based study is a first step towards conducting field research. As primate habitats become increasingly fragmented due to human influence, the ways in which primate change their locomotor habits to accommodate this fragmentation has implications for their survival. This research will also act as the cornerstone of the co-PI's career as a female scientist. As such, it will provide the opportunity for her to mentor undergraduate students and offers research training that is vital for her future career.

The neck is an understudied, yet significant, anatomical region. It is especially important in primates because it maintains postural stability during the diverse forms of locomotion practice by the primate order. Stability is especially important in the head because it houses the eyes and inner ears, which allow animals to efficiently navigate complex environments. Within our hominin lineage, drastic changes have occurred in both the shape and size of the head as well as our manner of walking. These changes likely affected how the neck balanced the head in our fossil ancestors. The relationship between neck form and neck function will be addressed by collecting two measures of form: radiographs of maximum ranges of head and neck motion and range of head and neck motion during locomotion. These measures of form will be statistically compared to specific measures of vertebral form taken from 3D scans of skeletal specimens. The statistical relationships will then be used to understand the function of fossil species based on the preserved form. This work will further the understanding of neck function, its relationships to vertebral form, and its evolution within the hominin lineage.",NSF,Arizona State University,AZ,29950,1731142,william.kimbel@asu.edu,William,Kimbel,1,"The goal of this research was to shed light on the relationship between form and function in the primate neck in the hopes of applying it to fossil specimens. Primates are the ideal group to understand how the neck functions during locomotion because they practice a diverse array of locomotor modes. The neck facilitates head stability during locomotion as well as head mobility when the trunk is stationary. The locomotor function of the neck was quantified through filming and analyzing the habitual locomotion of five primate species. Head and neck mobility were quantified through collecting intervertebral ranges of motion from radiographs. These measures of function were compared to morphometric data collected from three-dimensional surface scans of museum specimens.

            Results demonstrate that bony measures of vertebral shape do not correlate with maximum ranges of intervertebral motion but rather point to the soft tissues in joint stability. Additionally, the locomotor studies show that the head and neck behave differently during different modes of locomotion. However, these functional variations failed to correlate with vertebral form. These results are reported in the dissertation document, available on ProQuest. The range of motion study is under review at the American Journal of Physical Anthropology and the kinematics study is in preparation for submission to the Journal of Experimental Biology this winter. Due to the lack of relationship between form and function, they could not be applied to the fossil record.

            Although negative, the results demonstrate that the variations in cervical vertebral morphology seen in fossil species are not likely due to differences in ranges of motion. Skeletal data are being uploaded to Morphosource.org. Ranges of intervertebral motion have been published with the dissertation document and will be included in the peer-reviewed publication. Two students were mentored as a part of this research, one at Arizona State University and one at Duke University. The funding provided significantly improved the breadth of depth of the dissertation research.

"Chemical bonds between phosphorus and oxygen are important in building DNA and RNA, and also in supplying modern cells with energy. It is not known, however, whether the first life forms had the same chemistry, and early life in particular may have run on sulfur instead of phosphorus. This project will work backwards from the traces of this sulfur-based chemistry in modern life to reconstruct the role of sulfur-oxygen bonds in early ecosystems. Predictions made from this approach will be compared to the carbon and sulfur isotope record in  >2.5 billion year old rocks. We will use the astrobiology social media platform (SAGANet) for the conversations with public about this project and other studies of evolution of life on Earth.  
 
Phosphate esters, such as nucleotide triphosphates, diphosphates, and pyrophosphate, are the central component of energy metabolism in all living cells. It is not known, however, whether they were of similar paramount importance at the origin of life or in the first cells, or whether another kind of chemistry was playing the same role there. Considerations from geochemistry, molecular evolution, and systems biology imply that thioesters - high-energy bonds based on sulfur instead of phosphorus - may have supplied energy in the first metabolisms on Earth. This project will develop a broad and detailed understanding of the natural history of thioester utilization, working backwards to reconstruct ancient biochemistry from contemporary metabolism, and simultaneously examining pre-biological chemistries that can couple thioester formation and degradation. These two lines of study will allow the research team to infer the carbon and sulfur isotopic signatures of important metabolic pathways in a putative early thiobiosphere, and test whether these signatures are preserved in the >2.5 billion year old geological record. The results of this project should be of broad interest, and the project will engage with the scientific community and the public through journal publications as well as an established astrobiology social media platform (SAGANet). Select high school serving communities traditionally underrepresented in science will be reached through semester-long programs led by SAGANet graduate student mentors and facilitated by the investigators of this project.",NSF,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,484560,1724099,chrishouse@psu.edu,Christopher,House,1,"A major goal of this research was to directly and critically evaluate past claims that thioesters were central to the origin of life. In the previous years, we observed surprising thioester formation under plausible prebiotic conditions. This past year, the project has focused on elucidating the chemical mechanisms involved in the thioester formation observed. The thioester formation observed to date suggests that there is robust thioester formation plausible for the early Earth. The thioesters would be useful for the origin of life and the evolution of early cells and/or microorganisms. Understanding the chemical mechanisms involved in this thioester formation is critical for an accurate estimation of the flux of these thioesters for the early ocean. At present, we are writing a paper reporting the prebiotic thioester formation, discussing the chemical mechanism for its formation, and estimating the ranging of possible fluxes for these thioesters the early Earth. We also have follow-up work related to how the thioesters might be used during origin of life processes, as well as looking at the process for other early Solar System environments. We also continue to also look at thioester hydrolysis in order to best be able to understand its steady state availability for early cells. The work is highly significant because it presently indicates that there is a viable energy source to drive origin of life processes that connects directly to the use of thioester bonds in present metabolisms. This will provide a remarkable foundation for other researchers to piece together steps for the emergence of life on Earth.

"Understanding how gene by environment interactions result in specific phenotypes is a core goal of modern biology and has real-world impacts on such things as crop management. Developing and managing successful crop practices is a goal that is fundamentally tied to our national food security. By applying novel computational visual analytical methods, this project seeks to identify and unravel the complex web of interactions linking genotypes, environments and phenotypes. These methods will first need to be designed and developed into usable software applications that can handle large volumes of crop phenomics data. High-throughput sensing technologies collect large volumes of field data for many plant traits, such as flowering time, related to crop development and production. The maize cultivars used here come from multiple genotypes that have been grown under a variety of environmental conditions, in order to give the widest range of conditions for understanding the interactions. The resulting data sets are growing quickly, both in size and complexity, but the analytical tools needed to extract knowledge and catalyze scientific discoveries have significantly lagged behind. The methodologies to be developed in this project represent a systematic attempt at bridging this rapidly widening divide. The project is inherently interdisciplinary, involving close research partnerships among computer scientists, plant scientists, and mathematicians. The research outcomes will be tightly integrated with education using a multipronged approach that includes, among others, postdoctoral and student training (graduates and undergraduates), curriculum development for a new campus-wide interdisciplinary undergraduate degree in Data Analytics, conference tutorials for training phenomics data practitioners, and contribution to the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities (particularly women) in STEM fields through the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.


This project will lead to the design and development of a new, scalable, visual analytics platform suitable for hypothesis extraction and refinement from complex phenomics data sets. Focus on hypothesis extraction is critical in the context of phenomics data sets because much of the high-throughput sensing data being generated in crop fields are generated in the absence of specifically formulated hypotheses. Extracting plausible hypotheses from the data represents an important but tedious task. To this end, this project will apply and develop new capabilities using emerging advanced algorithmic principles, particularly from the branch of mathematics called algebraic topology that studies shapes and structure of complex data. The research objectives are three-fold. First, the project will employ and extend emerging algorithmic techniques from algebraic topology to decode the structure of large, complex phenomics data. Second, an interactive visual analytic platform will be developed to facilitate knowledge discovery using the extracted topological structures. Lastly, the quality and validity of a new visual analytic platform designed by this team will be tested using real-world maize data sets as well as simulated inputs as testbeds. The developed framework will encode functions for scientists to delineate hypotheses of three kinds: i) genetic characterization of single complex traits; ii) genetic characterization of multiple traits that share potentially pleiotropic effects; and iii) decoding and detailed characterization of genotype-by-environmental interactions, in particular, through a collaborative pilot study of maize flowering and growth traits. The expected significance of the proposed work is that biologists will be able to extract different types of testable hypotheses from plant phenomics data sets by employing a new class of visual analytic tools, and thus obtain a deeper understanding of the interactions among genotypes, environments and phenotypes. The project is potentially transformative in two ways: i) it will introduce advanced mathematical and computational principles into mainstream phenomic data analysis; and ii) it will usher in a new era where biologists spearhead data-driven hypothesis extraction and discovery with the aid of interactive, informative, and intuitive tools. The project will have a direct impact on the state of software in phenomics for fundamental data-driven discovery. To facilitate broader community adoption, the project will integrate the tools into the CyVerse Institute, and to a community phenomics software outlet. It will also lead to the development of automated scientific workflows. Project website: http://tdaphenomics.eecs.wsu.edu/",NSF,Iowa State University,IA,200000,1661475,schnable@iastate.edu,Patrick,Schnable,1,"The project represents the first concrete demonstration of topological data analysis for plant phenomics data. Topological data analysis is one of the emerging mathematical principles with a wide range of real-world applications. The project was able to successfully demonstrate how topological data analysis can be used to analyze plant phenomics data sets and help in extracting different types of hypotheses relating to how different genotypes (crop varieties) interact with various environmental variables (e.g., temperature, humidity) to effect certain key phenotypic traits (e.g., plant height, growth rate). The project also demonstrated, through application on real-world data sets, that this interaction is not all the same, and that there is tremendous diversity in the way to different genotypes interact with different environmental variables.

 From a computational standpoint, the project?s developments contributed to the mathematical and algorithmic foundations in topological data analysis, including in data modeling, feature extraction, hypothesis formulation, and interactive visualization. It created an open source software toolkit for complex multi-dimensional data sets that have become a feature in multiple data-driven domains.

 The project led to the training of multiple graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdocs, on various interdisciplinary topics at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and biology and life sciences.

High-throughput sensing technologies collect large volumes of field data for many plant traits, such as flowering time, related to crop development and production. The maize cultivars used here come from multiple genotypes that have been grown under a variety of environmental conditions, in order to give the widest range of conditions for understanding the interactions. The resulting data sets are growing quickly, both in size and complexity, but the analytical tools needed to extract knowledge and catalyze scientific discoveries have significantly lagged behind. The methodologies to be developed in this project represent a systematic attempt at bridging this rapidly widening divide. The project is inherently interdisciplinary, involving close research partnerships among computer scientists, plant scientists, and mathematicians. The research outcomes will be tightly integrated with education using a multipronged approach that includes, among others, postdoctoral and student training (graduates and undergraduates), curriculum development for a new campus-wide interdisciplinary undergraduate degree in Data Analytics, conference tutorials for training phenomics data practitioners, and contribution to the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities (particularly women) in STEM fields through the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.


This project will lead to the design and development of a new, scalable, visual analytics platform suitable for hypothesis extraction and refinement from complex phenomics data sets. Focus on hypothesis extraction is critical in the context of phenomics data sets because much of the high-throughput sensing data being generated in crop fields are generated in the absence of specifically formulated hypotheses. Extracting plausible hypotheses from the data represents an important but tedious task. To this end, this project will apply and develop new capabilities using emerging advanced algorithmic principles, particularly from the branch of mathematics called algebraic topology that studies shapes and structure of complex data. The research objectives are three-fold. First, the project will employ and extend emerging algorithmic techniques from algebraic topology to decode the structure of large, complex phenomics data. Second, an interactive visual analytic platform will be developed to facilitate knowledge discovery using the extracted topological structures. Lastly, the quality and validity of a new visual analytic platform designed by this team will be tested using real-world maize data sets as well as simulated inputs as testbeds. The developed framework will encode functions for scientists to delineate hypotheses of three kinds: i) genetic characterization of single complex traits; ii) genetic characterization of multiple traits that share potentially pleiotropic effects; and iii) decoding and detailed characterization of genotype-by-environmental interactions, in particular, through a collaborative pilot study of maize flowering and growth traits. The expected significance of the proposed work is that biologists will be able to extract different types of testable hypotheses from plant phenomics data sets by employing a new class of visual analytic tools, and thus obtain a deeper understanding of the interactions among genotypes, environments and phenotypes. The project is potentially transformative in two ways: i) it will introduce advanced mathematical and computational principles into mainstream phenomic data analysis; and ii) it will usher in a new era where biologists spearhead data-driven hypothesis extraction and discovery with the aid of interactive, informative, and intuitive tools. The project will have a direct impact on the state of software in phenomics for fundamental data-driven discovery. To facilitate broader community adoption, the project will integrate the tools into the CyVerse Institute, and to a community phenomics software outlet. It will also lead to the development of automated scientific workflows.

Topological data analysis is one of the emerging mathematical principles with a wide range of real-world applications. The project was able to successfully demonstrate how topological data analysis can be used to analyze plant phenomics data sets and help in extracting different types of hypotheses relating to how different genotypes (crop varieties) interact with various environmental variables (e.g., temperature, humidity) to effect certain key phenotypic traits (e.g., plant height, growth rate). The project also demonstrated, through application on real-world data sets, that this interaction is not all the same, and that there is tremendous diversity in the way to different genotypes interact with different environmental variables.

From a computational standpoint, the project's developments contributed to the mathematical and algorithmic foundations in topological data analysis, including in data modeling, feature extraction, hypothesis formulation, and interactive visualization. It created multiple open source software toolkits for complex multi-dimensional data sets that have become a feature in multiple data-driven domains. In particular, this project led to the design and development of a scalable, visual analytics platform suitable for the interactive exploration of  phenomics data sets. 

The project led to the training of multiple graduate students on various interdisciplinary topics at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, biology and life sciences.

"Bacteria may acquire novel DNA from other bacteria in their environment through the process of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This transferred DNA often encodes new functions that expand an organism's niche, change its relationships with its host or provide a competitive edge against other organisms within its environment. For example, antibiotic resistance genes are frequently observed to be transferred between organisms. New high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies now allow researchers to simultaneously sequence data from millions of different bacterial species in a single sample, called metagenome sequencing. Thousands of publicly available metagenomic sequence datasets exist for samples from very diverse ecologies, including: gut microbiomes from humans, animals and insects, soil and root communities, surfaces in built environments, hydrothermal mats and vents, wastewater treatment plants, freshwater sources and marine ecosystems. Using these datasets, the research team will develop a suite of computational tools for examining the mobile gene content of these datasets, to identify those genes that may shape the response of microbial communities to stress. Graduate students will carry out the research under the direction of the PI, while undergraduates will be trained to use the resulting methods through a series of hackathons aimed at building the computational science community focused on microbial community research. Recruiting efforts will be aimed at measurably increasing the diversity in computational biology throughout the greater Finger Lakes region. 

Functional characterization of microbial communities is often performed using metagenomic shotgun data, obtained by sequencing microbial samples in their entirety. Yet, despite its importance, few methods exist to distinguish genes that are inherited versus those genes which have been mobilized and transferred between organisms in this type of short-read sequence data. By providing new computational methods for reconstructing mobile genetic elements in short-read data, researchers can tap into the huge resource of existing metagenomic data to examine the role of HGT in shaping the functions of natural microbial communities. This research will be transformative for all fields of microbiology, including clinical microbiology, microbiome research, environmental microbiology, and microbial engineering.",NSF,Cornell University,NY,1029606,1661338,ibrito@cornell.edu,Ilana,Brito,1,"Final Outcomes 

The flexible portion of a bacterium?s genome?the DNA that is exchanged with other bacteria through the process of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)?allows the organism to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions by obtaining and incorporating novel functions, including antibiotic resistance. Despite the importance of flexible DNA in shaping the roles of individual bacteria, basic facts about the frequency and conditions that promote HGT in natural ecosystems remain unknown. In this project, we aimed to implement several computational methods, using experimental or computational data, to determine the microbial hosts of specific mobile genes or genetic elements and to understand the nature of transfer between organisms.

Hi-C is a method by which distant or unconnected pieces of DNA can be physically linked and sequenced. After applying this method to gut microbiome samples, hybrid pieces of DNA need to be carefully analyzed to determine its sources. We developed a computational pipeline to determine the connections and internally validate them. We show that our approach can repeatedly recapitulate associations between mobile elements and host bacterial genomes. This has been published in Nature Communications (doi:10.1038/s41467-020-18164-7) and the code is available on Github.

We developed a computational pipeline to analyze single-cell fusion PCR data from a new method called OIL-PCR (Figure 1) that links mobile genes with their hosts. In this work, we examined strain-level carriage of mobile genes. This work, including our computational pipeline, is now published and available in eLife (doi:10.7554/eLife.66834).

A major question related to HGT is what governs which bacteria transfer with which bacteria. To answer this question, we amassed over 12,000 genomes equally representing the bacterial tree of life and modeled the recent transfer of mobile genetic elements. We applied several machine learning approaches and obtain near-perfect predictions of the HGT network (Figure 2), concluding that niche-specific genes largely govern HGT across the tree of life, but subnetworks of the transfer of specific genes are defined by HGT machinery genes and genes reflecting barriers to HGT. We further show that our approach can predict HGT networks of even small collections of organisms living in a specific ecology (marine, soil, plant roots, or human gut).This work has been accepted to Science Advances (Zhou et al., Sci. Adv. 2021; 7 : eabj5056).

These and other methods are outlined in a review written by Brito (PI) published in Nature Reviews Microbiology (doi:10.1038/ s41579-021-00534-7).

Broader Impacts: A major accomplishment of this award was our annual microbial genomics hackathons, held in 2018 and 2019 (our 2020 hackathon was canceled due to pandemic-related campus shutdowns). Our hackathons attracted both undergraduates and graduate students, who joined teams and apply computational tools to answer questions of their own choosing related to antibiotic resistance and microbiomes. Over the course of a weekend, with copious mentoring by faculty, senior graduate students and postdocs, students successfully applied a range of computational tools. The hackathon was paired with a 1-credit introductory course exposing students to the topic and basic coding skills. Students greatly appreciated the experience and it largely improved their confidence and overall interest in applying these tools and seeking future opportunities to broaden their education in computational biology.

"Due to the rapidly increasing volume of biological data from sequencing, imaging, and other technologies, data processing needs in the Life Sciences are now on par with physical and engineering disciplines. Importantly, the distributed nature of data generation in biology makes this situation even more challenging. Today one can hardly find a research institution or university without multiple high-throughput DNA sequencing machines, and there are often references to a ""data crisis"" in biology. Federal agencies, and the NSF in particular, are investing heavily in cyberinfrastructure by supporting development of high performance computing (HPC) resources such as the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE). Yet to a large extent, these resources remain unknown to biological researchers who overwhelmingly continue to rely on fragile in-house computation. The goal of this project is to ensure effective utilization of federal funds that have been invested into development of the national computing infrastructure. This project will extend the Galaxy software platform to leverage existing NSF hardware resources, increasing the value of existing infrastructure for biology researchers that were previously unable to take full advantage of these resources.

This project will follow a comprehensive approach that addresses the needs of experimental scientists, tool developers, and administrators of high performance compute systems (HPC). Access to national compute infrastructure will be expanded so that Galaxy will function as a middleware interface to existing heterogeneous environments such as XSEDE or individual systems such as Jetstream. Software components necessary to optimize Galaxy as a link between researchers and existing HPC will be developed based on pilot projects with the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), XSEDE, PSC, and Indiana University. (2) XSEDE resources to enable interactive data exploration and visualization will be leveraged to expand Galaxy's current capacity for dynamic scientific data analysis.  Integration with Interactive Analysis Environments, such as Jupyter or RStudio will allow manipulation and creation of Galaxy datasets using common scripting languages. Taking advantage of XSEDE resources will enable Galaxy's interactive environments and visual analytics to scale to large datasets and sophisticated workflows. (3) Sustainable training and outreach will focus on creating and disseminating curricula that enable investigators to learn skills needed to analyze large datasets. Creation of pre-configured infrastructure components for running workshops and develop modules for undergraduate and graduate face-to-face and on-line classes will expand the current educational portfolio to scale support for increasing numbers of Galaxy users, including disciplines beyond life sciences such as Natural Language Processing.

This infrastructure serves thousands of researchers worldwide performing millions of analyses every year (see https://galaxyproject.org/galaxy-project/statistics/). Specifically, this software enables individual research groups, labs or intitutions to deploy ""Galaxy instances"". An instance of Galaxy is an application that allows users to apply a wide variety of command-line, web-based, or interactive tools to any type of data through a web-browser (or programmatically via application programming interface [API]). A Galaxy instance can be configured to manage local or remote computational resources to schedule tool runs on any modern computational infrastructure including local hardware, conventional clusters, commercial or public clouds, and so on. The Galaxy team also develops and operates the Galaxy ToolShed--a growing repository of &gt;8,500 analysis tools available for use in Galaxy. The ToolShed is closely aligned with the BioConda community, making it simple to add BioConda tools to the ToolShed and enabling Galaxy to automatically resolve software dependencies of analysis tools. The Galaxy software ecosystem also includes scheduling tools, tool development utilities, training infrastructure, and many other components.

The main public Galaxy site (https://usegalaxy.org) is an example of a Galaxy instance. It is located at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) and schedules jobs on a variety of geographically distributed resources such as Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and JetStream cloud at Indiana University. It supports thousands of users running hundreds of thousands jobs per month and stores &gt;5Pb of user data.

There is a comprehensive collection of tutorials covering all aspects of Galaxy from basic functionality to advanced analyses (https://training.galaxyproject.org). It is an excellent resource for learning about the system we seek to continue building as described in this proposal.

"Every spring and fall billions of birds migrate across the US, largely under the cover of darkness. Data collected by the US network of weather radars and new analysis methods let us track these migrations. The Dark Ecology Project will develop new resources allowing us to estimate the densities of migrating birds as they have changed in the last 20 years. One outcome will be our better ability to monitor bird populations and their migration systems, and the impacts of various environmental factors. The US network of weather radars has recorded a comprehensive 25-year archive of images of the atmosphere, which provides the baseline information about bird movements. Extracting biological information from the images is not automated currently, making it very slow and inefficient. A team of ecologists and computer scientists will conduct novel research combining methods in computer vision and machine learning to unlock detailed information about bird migration from the entire US archive of weather radar data. The resulting dataset will be freely available, providing an information resource for researchers to estimate the number of birds migrating on any given night, measure the patterns and trends of bird populations, and do hypothesis driven science. The research will advance big data analysis and visualization techniques for large-scale science questions, and will engage scientists, conservation planners, students, and the general public with data, visualizations, and educational material about bird migration.

Dark Ecology will leverage large-scale cloud computing and develop novel computer vision, machine learning, and radar analysis methods to measure the densities and velocities of migrating birds across the US. Deep convolutional networks will be trained to discriminate migrating birds from precipitation and other clutter in the radar data. New techniques for domain transfer and weakly supervised training will enable the training of convolutional networks with only modest-sized training sets. Gaussian process (GP) models will be developed to create smooth national maps of migration density and velocity. Novel GP methods and cloud-computing workflows will allow us to scale to massive radar data sets and analyze the more then 200 million archived radar scans. The resulting data and tools will be curated with open access policies, and used by the research team to conduct ecological research about patterns and drivers of continent-scale migration.

Project Title:  Dark Ecology: Deep Learning and Massive Gaussian Processes to Uncover Biological Signals in Weather Radar

Recipient Organization: Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Cornell University

Project/Grant Period: 5/15/2017 - 6/30/2020

 

This project developed algorithms, software, and cloud workflows to extract measurements of nocturnal bird migration from the US archive of weather surveillance radar data. The project used these measurements to conduct hypothesis-driven scientific analyses of the patterns and drivers of bird migration at a continental scale. A central product of these efforts are daily bird migration maps and forecasts. These are published online in association with interactive tools for visualizing and understanding migration patterns and trends. These maps are the first of their kind and display real-time analyses of nocturnal migration intensity across the contiguous US. 

The project developed a deep learning model to extract bird migration measurements from the network of 143 weather surveillance radar stations located across the contiguous US. The model removes precipitation from radar data while preserving roughly 96% of the bird migration signal. The project completed a biological analysis of &gt;99% of all historical US radar data. The results summarize bird migration activity by elevation and represents the first full biological analysis of the US radar archive. We are currently preparing an open data set of historical bird migration activity from every radar scan.

The scientific products generated by the project have contributed to the applications of machine learning in the analysis of massive data sets and have allowed scientists to explore central questions in avian migration ecology and conservation. This includes three landmark studies applied to radar-based estimates of nocturnal migration activity within the contiguous US. The first used radar data to document declines in migration activity, the second documented shifts in the timing of bird migration, and the third developed a bird migration forecast system to model the intensity of bird migration across the continent. All three represent major advancements in how we understand, study, and model the patterns and drivers of seasonal bird migration, with critical insights on the long-term implications of global change for migratory bird populations.

The real-time migration maps and forecasts generated by the project have broad applications reducing bird mortality through collisions with illuminated buildings, airplanes, and wind turbines. These products also provide an exciting platform to engage and educate the public on bird ecology and conservation. In total, the outcomes from the project represent significant conceptual and empirical advancements that touch on multiple scientific disciplines whose products will benefit research, education, and conservation for years to come.

"An award is made to the University of Maryland to bring together a network of butterfly monitoring groups and experts in both informatics and statistics to develop a series of tools to greatly expand the access and use of butterfly data and knowledge. Citizen-scientists throughout North America perform thousands of surveys as part of a continent-wide network of butterfly monitoring programs, yet data from these surveys, are little known due to a lack of:  1) knowledge about and access to the data, 2) tools to visualize and share these critical data sets, and 3) appropriate models for analysis. Through this project, several new tools will be developed and launched, including a web interface and visualization tool for a continental-scale butterfly monitoring program, a framework for the distribution and visualization for data emerging from a large network of butterfly monitoring programs, and a web-enabled database of species traits, and a suite of statistical models to analyze data resulting from the most common types of butterfly monitoring protocols. 

All efforts will be targeted toward developing tools that are broadly transferrable among butterfly monitoring programs as well as other insect monitoring programs, such as those focused on dragonflies, crickets, ladybeetles, and bees.   Tools will be designed to be useful not just to the scientific and management communities, but also for the general public, the primary collectors of butterfly monitoring data.  Throughout this project, undergraduates, graduates, and post-doctoral associates will be involved in all stages to foster education in information technology and statistical analysis.",NSF,Georgetown University,DC,177315,1738243,Leslie.Ries@georgetown.edu,Leslie,Ries,0,"Historically, the most common type of biodiversity data was specimens collected in the field and kept in museums.  However, over the past 30 years, the focus of biodiversity data collection has shifted radically from museum specimens to large-scale citizen science data collection programs, and nowhere is this more obvious than for butterflies.  Butterfly monitoring has grown exponentially over the last few decades with programs expanding in North America, Europe, and Asia.  Yet as late as the mid-2000s, the availability of large-scale survey data in North America was little known and even less used by the public or the scientific community.  Indeed, by 2006 there were only five peer-reviewed studies published using large-scale butterfly survey data from any North American program, even though these data had been collected since the mid-1970s (Fig. 1).  At the time, there was also a small but growing network of regional butterfly monitoring programs that used academic-like structured surveys (called Pollard Walks).  However, the use and even knowledge of those butterfly monitoring data in North America was hindered due to a series of informatics-related barriers. 

The overarching goal of this project was to eliminate those barriers, promote the knowledge and use of butterfly monitoring data in North America and provide the cyber-infrastructure to support and expand this growing network.  Note that this award to Georgetown University (DBI 1738243) is a transfer of an award originally made to the University of Maryland (DBI 1147049).  The final outcomes described here include achievements made during the performance phases at both the University of Maryland and Georgetown University.   In addition to the three goals defined in the original proposal, we substantially expanded the scope of our project by adding three additional goals.   We describe the final outcomes under each of these six goals.

1) Develop a data management system which includes a download and visualization tool for survey data from the North American Butterfly Association (NABA) count program.  

All historical data (back to 1977) were ingested into a new platform developed to manage, share and visualize these data.  This included over 600,000 observations made during 10,000 surveys across the US and Canada.  This web-enabled database was launched in 2015 and is available at www.webutterfly.org.  Data from these NABA surveys have been used in 8 peer-reviewed publications since the launch of this original project in 2012.  

2) Develop the best statistical approaches and research tools to analyze butterfly monitoring data.  

Much of the statistical development was accomplished and published in the papers presenting results from the various monitoring programs.  To date, the programs which we have used for scientific publications were largely from NABA (8 publications), The Ohio Butterfly Monitoring Network (7 publications) and the Illinois Butterfly Monitoring Network (4 publications).  Two methods papers (one on integrating data from multiple regional networks and one on using data for joint species distribution models) were also published in 2016.

3) Develop a knowledgebase of butterfly life history and ecological traits

We have digitized records from over 10 North American Field guides to butterflies.  We summarized those traits in an initial database for 500 species of butterflies.  That work is being continued under the auspices of an ongoing NSF-funded project GoLife: 1541557 (ButterflyNet--an integrative framework for comparative biology).  We anticipate that the trait database from this work will be released online in 2020.    

4) Expanded scope:  Develop a data management and visualization system for regional butterfly monitoring programs.

During our inaugrual workshop in May 2012, a lack of data management tools was identified as a primary barrier to the expansion and use of butterfly monitoring data from regional monitoring programs.  We thus developed an online portal, called PollardBase (www.pollardbase.org) which was launched in 2014.  Currently there are over 15 programs with 600 active users on Pollardbase and we have ingested approximately 12000 historical survey data into the portal and over 9000 additional surveys have been entered directly by PollardBase volunteers.   

5) Expanded scope: Develop an umbrella organization to serve the needs of those producing, using, or developing systems to manage and share citizen-science butterfly data in North America.

In our inaugural workshop in May 2012, we decided to form an umbrella organization to serve the wider needs and more closely connect the butterfly monitoring community.  As such, we formed the North American Butterfly Monitoring Network and PI-Ries currently serves as its director (www.thebutterflynetwork.org).  A sister site focused on monarch-centric citizen science (www.monarchnet.org) was also launched. 

6) Expanded scope: Use butterfly data in undergraduate teaching to introduce students to data-intensive approaches to ecology.

PI Ries has worked with two classroom instructors to bring these approaches into the classroom based on NABA butterfly data.  She has recently submitted a manuscript to Ecosphere describing these various activities (and including a formal assessment of outcomes for one of them).

"Insects are a critical component of many primate diets, and are thought to have played an important role in the evolution of the primate family. The physiological adaptations that underpin insectivory are not well understood, and this dissertation research project will study internal dietary adaptations, such as digestive enzymes, that primates use to digest this important food resource. The research findings will provide insight into the evolution of dietary ecologies, niche separation, and specialization of primate species. The project will support academic training and mentoring of female and underrepresented minority students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The undergraduate student will have the opportunity to develop and conduct their own research project and present their findings at the Rutgers Undergraduate Research Symposium. An online educational module explaining dietary adaptations to elementary school students will be developed and distributed at no cost. This teaching resource will incorporate results of this study, as well as information about anthropological fieldwork, and is intended to foster an interest in science and human evolution in K-12 students.

Insect consumption is widespread across human and non-human primates, and is thought to have been a driving force in primate evolution, selecting for the primate visual system and other morphological features. Insects, especially termites, may have been a key resource for early hominins. This project focuses on the digestive enzymes acidic mammalian chitinase and pepsin A as potential adaptations for insectivory in New World primates, which exhibit a high degree of insectivory and a diverse array of dietary ecologies. Using DNA samples, the investigator will conduct a broad, comparative survey of platyrrhine species to address the following questions: (1) Do all platyrrhines share a functional gene sequence for a chitinolytic enzyme, regardless of diet? (2) What are the patterns of convergence in digestive enzyme genes of insectivorous and non-insectivorous platyrrhines compared to insectivorous and sanguivorous bats? (3) Does the chitinase gene (CHIA) occur in greater copy numbers in more insectivorous species? And (4) does the proteolytic digestive enzyme pepsin A (PGA) have higher gene copy numbers in platyrrhine species with high-protein diets? Having an understanding of the digestive enzymes and relevant genetic variation found in New World monkeys will allow comparisons with other extant primate groups, such as Old World monkeys, apes, and humans, as well as other insectivorous mammals.",NSF,Rutgers University New Brunswick,NJ,3200,1650864,robertsc@scarletmail.rutgers.edu,Robert,Scott,1,"Primates have a particularly diverse array of dietary ecologies, from exclusively insectivorous species to grass-eating monkeys, the primate digestive system has evolved in response to a multitude of pressures. Endogenous digestive enzymes are an important part of the dietary adaptations found in primates, but comparatively little research has sought to understand how primate digestive enzymes have adapted to the variety of challenges posed by primate foods. This project examined the genes coding for the digestive enzymes lysozyme C (LYZ), pancreatic ribonuclease (RNASE1), and acidic mammalian chitinase (CHIA) in a comparative non-human primate sample (n = 7, n = 25, n = 35, respectively). Specifically, we investigated evidence for inter-specific variation and adaptive evolution in these digestive enzyme genes related to folivorous and insectivorous diets. Datasets were assembled through gene sequencing and genome mining, and evaluated with phylogenetic analyses, including PAML and RELAX. 

Our results show evidence for diet-related changes in pancreatic ribonuclease and acidic mammalian chitinase genes in primates. In the folivorous New World monkey Alouatta palliata, the RNASE1 gene was duplicated twice and the daughter genes exhibit changes that are indicative of a reduced efficiency against double-stranded RNA, suggesting a novel, and possibly digestive function. This had previously only been shown in colobine primates, but these findings suggest that in both foregut and caeco-colic fermenting primates pancreatic ribonuclease has convergently evolved a new role for digesting the products of microbial fermentation.







For acidic mammalian chitinase, results are consistent with the hypothesis that the enzyme is used for the digestion of insect exoskeletons. Early primates likely had three CHIA genes, in congruence with the theory that insects were an important component of the ancestral primate diet. Most extant primate species retain only one functional CHIA paralog. Exceptions include two colobine species (non-insectivorous), in which all CHIA genes have premature stop codons, and several New World monkey species that retain two functional genes. The more insectivorous species in the sample also have the largest number of functional CHIA genes, retaining three functional CHIA paralogs. Tarsius syrichta, the most insectivorous primate, has a total of five CHIA genes, two of which may be duplications specific to the tarsier lineage. Selection analyses indicate that CHIA genes are under more intense selection in species with higher insect consumption, as well as in smaller-bodied species (&lt;500 g), providing molecular support for Kay?s Threshold, a well-established component of primatological theory. CHIA genes are not subject to copy number variation in primates. 

Overall, these results provide evidence that pancreatic ribonuclease and acidic mammalian chitinase are important digestive enzyme adaptations for folivorous howler monkeys and insectivorous primates, respectively. These proteins may provide crucial adaptive benefits by improving the digestion of foliage and insects, and thus increasing energy and amino acid returns to the animal.

This award was instrumental in improving the dissertation of a female graduate student, who successfully defended the dissertation and earned her doctorate. It further provded opportunities for undergraduates to learn transferable wet lab and computational skills.

"The skeleton can provide many clues about movement and behavior patterns, and this form-function relationship makes bone an important source of data for reconstructing the evolutionary history and past behaviors of animals and humans. In this dissertation project, the response of bone to habitual activity will be investigated in murine and primate models to improve our understanding of entheses (muscle attachment sites on bone), because the relationship of this particular feature of bone to function is not fully understood. Experimental evidence of enthesis change due to activity will be applicable across a variety of disciplines, including paleoanthropology, biology, clinical medicine and forensic science. All images generated as a result of this work will be made available to other researchers in order to promote further interdisciplinary research. The project will support student research experiences, including for students from groups underrepresented in STEM research, and both traditional and online public science outreach activities.

The use of entheses to reconstruct species-level locomotor patterns and individual occupation relies on the premise that bone responds to mechanical loading with remodeling and the accumulation of new bone. However, recent experimental studies have questioned the assumed effect of muscle activity on bone and demonstrated no relationship between exercise and measures of the entheseal surface. This project addresses the methodological issues concerning attachment site biology, taking a multilevel approach to assess if and how entheses can be used for behavioral reconstruction. The first component of this study utilizes a murine model with controlled and elevated running and climbing regimes to test whether increased activity results in corresponding increases to muscle force-generating capacity, bone surface roughness, bone depositional rate, and/or bone cross-sectional geometric properties. The results of this aim will then be applied to an existing sample of primate skeletons in order to observe how different locomotor modes relate to enthesis development. A selection of locomotor-relevant entheses in suspensory, quadrupedal and bipedal primates will be examined with surface and CT scans for patterns of attachment site characteristics by activity. A combined analysis of the macroscopic bone surface and its underlying mechanical environment will provide a comprehensive view of the enthesis region. These data will provide an empirical foundation for the interpretation of enthesis morphology, with the long-term goal of enabling non-destructive behavioral reconstruction on fossil primates using these structures.",NSF,George Washington University,DC,23304,1650933,mcfarlin@gwu.edu,Shannon,McFarlin,1,"Cassandra Turcotte has completed research for her dissertation ""Behavioral Reconstruction and the Effects of Habitual Activity on the Bone-Muscle Interface"" supported by the NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant. During her funding period, she acquired the cadavers of several species of primates from institutions around the globe. During the course of this project, she traveled to Antwerp, Belgium in order to collect specimens from the Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp (KMDA) and to Stony Brook University for specimens housed in the Department of Anthropology. Additional primates were also made available by Dr. Andrew Deane at the Indiana University School of Medicine. 
 With these cadavers, Turcotte dissected the primates? musculoskeletal anatomy until only the skeleton remained. She took the bones to Duke University in Durham, NC, where she was trained to operate a microCT scanner using her samples. The primates? muscles and bones were both digitally curated, through photographs and microCT scans, for widespread anthropological use. 
 Turcotte was interested in understanding the connection between the internal architecture of muscles and the shape of muscle attachment sites on bone, the latter of which are frequently used in anthropology to reconstruct living behavior from skeletal remains. In order to continue using muscle attachment sites in this way, it was essential to clarify the relationship between soft tissue, bone and behavior, and to what extent the shape of these regions is truly influenced by living activity over natural variation. Primates represent a great model for these questions, as they?re genetically diverse and different species engage in a variety of locomotor behaviors. The study did not find a significant locomotor influence on muscle attachment site shape, and joins a growing body of work cautioning against behavioral reconstruction using these regions until a biologically-grounded, experimentally validated method can be developed.

"Many nonhuman primate species have sex differences in the size and shape of their canine and premolar teeth, but in the human lineage those differences are smaller. This project models the genetic inheritance of canine and premolar tooth size in several primate species, including a modern human sample, to examine the impact of genetic structures on the evolution of sex differences in canine size. The findings will be used to understand mechanisms of canine reduction in the human lineage and canine expansion in other primates, and contribute to our understanding of evolutionary relationships among diet, behavior, and dentition in our hominin ancestors. elective pressures related to aggression and diet are hypothesized to contribute to sex differences in primate canine teeth, and changes in these selective pressures may have led to human canine and premolar reduction. The project will support training of a female student in a STEM field, production of a large dataset that will be made public for other researchers, and outreach activities such as public lectures focused on improving public understanding of primate diversity and evolution.

Dental characteristics provide valuable evidence of genetic relatedness in primates, and tooth measurements are well-suited to classical quantitative genetic analysis, which uses pedigree data to estimate the genetic heritability of traits. This project assesses the genetic inheritance of canine and premolar dimensions in several primate species with the specific aim of elucidating the genetic mechanisms underlying sex differences in the morphology of these teeth. Previous researchers have stated that sex differences in genetic inheritance and low overlap in male and female genetic material contribute to the evolution of sex differences, but these hypotheses have not been tested in primates. This project addresses three fundamental research questions: 1) Are sex differences in canine and premolar size associated with sex differences in trait inheritance? 2) Do the same genes impact the size of the upper canine and lower premolar? 3) Do primate species with sex differences in the canine have more evolvable canines than those with no sex differences? These questions can be answered using tooth size measurements collected from primate populations with known pedigrees. Statistical models will be used to estimate the inheritance of canine and premolar size in each population.  Preliminary data collection and analyses of saddle-back tamarins indicate that there are significant differences between male and female patterns of trait inheritance, but data from additional populations and species will demonstrate whether this is typical of primates broadly or a peculiarity limited to a single tamarin population.",NSF,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,MN,16340,1650802,kmcnulty@umn.edu,Kieran,McNulty,1,"Anna Hardin has completed data collection for her dissertation, ""Quantitative genetics of sexual dimorphism in primate teeth,"" supported by the NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant. During the funding period, Hardin spent two months at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History collecting data from dental casts of Verreaux's sifakas from Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve in Madagascar. The data collected during the funding period contribute to Hardin's research on the genetic inheritance of tooth size in non-human primates, and on genetic constraints on the evolution of sex differences in tooth size.

The Beza Mahafaly sifaka collection initially included dental casts from 113 individuals and dental molds from 104 individuals. Since tooth measurements could only be collected from dental casts, Hardin created epoxy resin casts (Figure 2) of the dental molds in the collection. These casts were then donated to the Yale Peabody Museum and are now available to other researchers.

Measurements were collected from 213 casts of the upper tooth row using sliding digital calipers. Dental wear and breakage were minimal in these specimens because dental molds are collected from sifakas at Beza Mahafaly when individuals are approximately 12 months old, before their teeth are severely damaged. Repeated measures of ten casts were used to assess measurement reliability.

In combination with pedigree data gathered through behavioral observation at Beza Mahafaly between 1971 and 1995, the dental measurements collected through this project will be used to estimate the heritability of tooth size in sifakas. Dental trait heritabilities have been estimated from humans and captive baboons, but this represents the first attempt to estimate tooth size heritability from a wild non-human primate population. The publications that will result from this project will broaden our understanding of the genetic inheritance of dental characteristics. These findings will then be applied to improve study of the evolution of dental characteristics, and, since fossilized dental remains make up a large proportion of the primate fossil record, to improve our understanding of primate evolution.

Hardin's dissertation will be completed in 2018. Once the results have been published, the data collected through this project will be added to the Madagascar Sifaka Database managed by the Yale Peabody Museum and made available to the larger Beza Mahafaly research team and other researchers. Future projects may use these data to examine generational change in tooth size in the Beza Mahafaly sifaka population.

"All living primates have forward-facing eyes, which provide a large field of binocular vision and precise depth perception. This dissertation project will test competing hypotheses about the evolutionary origins of binocular vision in primates through a combination of behavioral experiments and comparative anatomical studies in living primates. The project will produce a freely accessible database of CT scans of a diverse sample of mammals, which will benefit researchers as well as clinicians. The investigators will engage the public in this work through several outreach programs aimed at increasing both public understanding of scientific research and participation in STEM for students from groups underrepresented in science. The project will also facilitate the training of several undergraduates through a program that prepares first generation college students and members of underrepresented groups for graduate research. 

To determine which ecological factors led to the evolution of a wide field of binocular vision during early primate evolution, this project will employ both comparative morphological and experimental methods. First, the investigators will measure binocular field in an ecologically and phylogenetically diverse comparative mammalian sample to determine which ecological variables are associated with increases in binocular field size across mammals. Binocular field size will be measured from micro-CT scans of fluid-preserved specimens that are iodine stained to render the soft tissues of the eyes visible. Second, the researchers will experimentally evaluate the functional importance of binocular vision for the types of grasping and leaping behaviors that competing primate origins hypotheses suggest selected for increased binocular field width. Small-bodied nocturnal strepsirrhines will be filmed performing grasping and leaping tasks under normal conditions and with reduced binocular visual field. This integrated approach to studying the functional significance of a wide field of binocular vision will provide a test of the competing adaptive scenarios for crown primate origins. The results of this project will help to address long-standing debates about a key feature of the primate order.",NSF,University of Texas at Austin,TX,12121,1650734,eckirk@austin.utexas.edu,Edward,Kirk,1,"All living and fossil primates have forward facing eyes,which provides them with a large binocular field.

The debate over which factors led to the evolution of distinctive primate traits has been a major question in biological anthropology for over a century. This debate remains active today, with three separate hypotheses prevalent in the literature, each of which suggest that a particular ecological factor and associated  behavior created selective pressures that led to the evolution of distinctive primate traits. The three competing hypotheses variously suggest that arboreal leaping locomotion, feeding on fruit or hunting insects selected for the distinctive primate traits, including a wide binocular field. In order for one of these behaviors to have created a selective pressure favoring the evolution of a wide binocular field, that trait must provide an advantage in the performance of that behavior. Therefore each hypothesis makes testable predictions about the functional importance and 1) how binocular field width effects performance at these tasks and 2) what other mammals are likely to have evolved wide binocular fields. This project explicitly tests both of these predictions for each hypothesis through a combination of experimental work with  two lemur species considered good ecological proxies of early primates and a comparative study of mammalian eye orientation. 
First, we worked with captive populations of two small-bodied nocturnal lemur species (fat tailed dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs) to determine how binocular field width affects performance in the three behaviors invoked by the competing hypotheses. We used high-speed cameras to record the animals performing the tasks under normal and reduced binocular field conditions. We then quantified and compared performance between the normal and reduced binocular field conditions. Preliminary results indicate that a wide binocular field is not required to accurately judge the distance between two branches, it does improve the animal?s ability to rapidly connect multiple jumps and therefore more quickly through its environment via leaping. These preliminary results suggest that forward facing eyes could have been selected for early in primate evolution to facilitate rapid and efficient leaping locomotion, and provides some support for one of the hypotheses. 
 Second, to determine which of the ecological conditions invoked by the hypotheses are associated with the evolution of a wide binocular field across mammals, we used high-resolution soft-tissue computed-tomography scans from a diverse set of mammals. We measured the orientation of the eyes and combined those data with evolutionary trees to test whether the invoked ecological variables are correlated with the evolution of more forward facing eyes across mammals. Due to the volume of data collected, analysis of the morphological and grasping experiment data is ongoing. 

The project has produced a large body of novel experimental and morphological data relating to primate origins and visual evolution. The results of this project have the potential to help resolve a long standing debate in biological anthropology in addition to significantly improving our understanding of a key primate trait and the earliest stages of primate evolution. The results obtained thus far have been presented at international and national academic conferences, however we have also sought to make our research accessible a broad audience. People are highly aware of the critical role their own sensory systems play in daily life, which makes this project intuitively appealing. We have worked to use the engaging and relatable nature of sensory biology to engage members of the public in understanding the results of this project. The results of this work has been presented at several outreach events both where the work was performed and in the researchers? local area.

"Biological adaptations are often observed to have evolved multiple times within a group of species. This phenomenon may be related to the occurrence of particular co-occurring traits within a group of species that make the evolution of some adaptations more likely than others. Among primate groups that use suspensory locomotion, this pattern of movement seems to have evolved multiple times independently. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how covariation among biological traits within the forelimbs of primates affected the trajectory of their evolution. The project contributes to an emerging understanding of how covariation of traits impacts the evolution of new body plans, in particular the evolution of humans’ distinct form of upright walking. In addition to training a graduate student, this project generates a large dataset that can be used to train undergraduate and high school students in study design, statistics, and computer coding. The doctoral student plans to publish short, public-oriented video abstracts of this project’s results, creating a direct link between active scientists and the public.

This project studies how changes in the way biological traits covary can affect the trajectory of evolution, potentially making specific adaptive suites more common in certain clades while inhibiting their evolution in other groups. The investigator plans to collect 3-dimensional data on the forelimb bones of primates from across the order, use evolutionarily informed statistics to identify traits that are associated with frequent suspensory behaviors, and examine how these traits covary in suspensory taxa and their close relatives using matrices. Different hypotheses about the evolution of suspension in primates predict different strengths and patterns of trait covariation in suspensory vs non-suspensory groups. The extent to which the common ancestors of humans, chimpanzees, and other apes were adapted for suspension is under active debate. By studying how suspension evolved in primates, this study will contribute to our understanding of early human evolution.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,New York University,NY,6439,2041700,sawilliams@nyu.edu,Scott,Williams,1,"Why do we walk upright on two legs when no other animals do? Why can we raise our arms above our heads when so few other animals can? Why do we get herniated discs in our back? The answer to all of these questions and more lies in our evolutionary history.

In this project, we try to understand how our evolutionary history shapes our bodies. Specifically, we are trying to untangle the way that suspensory behaviors have impacted that history. Suspensory behaviors are behaviors where an animal is underneath the object that supports their weight, rather than on top of it. A sloth hanging from a tree or a child swinging across monkey bars are both examples of suspensory behaviors.

Contrary to what is implied by the name ‘monkey bars’, however, the vast majority of monkeys are not suspensory &ndash; they would not use monkey bars the way we do, and instead would scramble across the top of them rather than swinging underneath. Indeed, many are unable to hold their arms over their head in a way that would even allow them to swing underneath monkey bars. But apes, the group of primates of which we are a part, do regularly use suspensory behaviors and most (including humans!) can and would cross monkey bars by swinging beneath them.

So apes evolved the ability to be suspensory and we inherited that from our common ancestor, right? Well, as it turns out, it’s far more complicated than that. There is a startling lack of evidence for suspensory adaptations in the fossil record of apes, leading many researchers to argue that some or even all living apes evolved the ability to be suspensory independently of one another. The question of how we explain the evolution of suspension multiple times within one small group of primates but almost never within all other groups of primates is the subject of a lively debate among scientists of human evolution.

One commonly referenced hypothesis for why a certain adaptation might evolve multiple times in one group of animals but not in other, related groups, is that there is a shift in the way those traits develop and are correlated, making it easier for evolution to create certain adaptations but not others. For example, the length of arms and legs are highly correlated. If natural selection favors individuals with long arms and long legs, that variant already exists in the population and evolution will happen quickly. If instead evolution favors long arms and short legs, individuals meeting that description are much rarer, and evolution will happen more slowly, if at all. So perhaps, the thinking goes, early in the evolution of apes there was a change in the way some traits are correlated that made it easier to evolve adaptations useful for suspension.

And this is the debate into which we are stepping with our project. We have created one of the largest databases of three dimensional data on primate limbs. It includes over 1500 individual primates, 10,000 individual bones, nearly 200,000 3D landmarks, and 1000 3D models. We are analyzing it using modern comparative statistical methods to identify which physical traits are associated with suspension in primates. We then test the way these physical traits are correlated to determine whether the correlation among these traits is, in fact, different in suspensory primates.

As part of this project we will gain a better understanding of the role suspension played in the evolutionary history of humans and how that impacted the evolution of bipedalism. Did we inherit our ability to bring our arms over our head as part of a suspensory past? How about our upright back posture and the problems (like slipped disks) that come with it? Did we become bipedal by, essentially, dropping down from the trees or by rising up from all fours? With this project we hope to make substantial progress toward answering these and similar questions.

"Primates depend heavily on plants resources for food in subtropical and tropical forests. However, the way in which overall forest structure and function is related to primate ecology and behavior is not fully understood. Tree species differ in their traits, some of which affect plant growth and survival (e.g., leaf mass), while others (e.g., fruit sugars) negative or positively affect primates. A ""trait landscape"" results from tree species' spatial distributions and traits, including phenological activity (e.g., flowering). This doctoral dissertation project examines how the constellation of plant traits in forests that primates inhabit affect primate diet, nutrition, and mating patterns such as monogamy. This project contributes to professional development and STEM education of undergraduates and assistants from local communities. International collaborators, including students and assistants, will obtain hands-on training in canopy access techniques, drone remote sensing, and programming using Python. The project will also support K-12 curriculum development and primate conservation in the study region. 

The goal of this project is to identify important ecological correlates of primate diet and monogamous mating system, by carefully considering and incorporating the bottom-up roles of plant traits and the spatiotemporal details of forest ecology and composition. Specifically, the project will examine the bottom-up effects of a tree community’s spatiotemporal distribution of functional and trophic effect traits on the nutritional ecology and mating pattern of Azara's owl monkey (Aotus azarae azarae). The researchers will (1) consider the owl monkeys' diet and nutritional ecology in a forest ecology context by considering the functional ecology/trait space of the tree community, and juxtapose their findings with those of traditional nutritional ecology analyses, and (2) assess how and why functional and trophic effect traits are equally distributed over space and time in gallery forests, with pair-living and a monogamous mating system as corollaries. The researchers will collect standardized plant samples and analyze these for functional traits, nutrients, and plant secondary compounds. They will furthermore assess the spatiotemporal details of species distribution and phenology through drone remote sensing, and statistically analyze spatial, nutritional, and community ecology parameters.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Colorado at Boulder,CO,14007,2020449,Herbert.Covert@Colorado.EDU,Herbert,Covert,1,"The goal of this project is to identify several important ecological correlates of primate diet and the monogamous mating system, by carefully considering and incorporating the bottom-up roles of plant traits and the spatiotemporal details of forest ecology and composition. For this project, the co-PI, Griette van der Heide, spent a total of 17 months at the Owl Monkey Project in Formosa Province, Argentina. Field work was completed at the end of June 2021, after intermittent and sparse access to the field site due to the global coronavirus outbreak. During this period the co-PI and her local team collected tree functional trait data (e.g., crown volume, fruit weight) from 67 species, of which more than 50% were sampled multiple times. She furthermore georeferenced sampled trees and transect points to align on the ground tree species observations with remotely sensed imagery for tree classification purposes.

While in Formosa, the co-PI fully trained three research assistants/students from la Universidad Nacional de Formosa (UNaF) and partially trained four other assistants from Argentina, and one from Canada, in tree climbing techniques. Several practice climbs were done on public land (riverine forest, UNaF terrain) or in neighborhood backyards, providing opportunity to give impromptu canopy access demonstrations, dissemination of research objectives, and general information regarding owl monkeys to local Formosenos/Chacoans. Three assistants continue to work on primate research and/or canopy access outreach.

Assistants were furthermore trained in primate observations, tree identification, field equipment use (e.g., telemetry, compass, binoculars, GPS, camera traps, clinometer), as well as phenology, whole tree, fruit, and leaf functional trait measurements. Four assistants were trained in basic drone operations (sensor/drone system set-up, drone/flight tracking). Though formal workshops were impossible in Formosa during the pandemic, informal one-on-one trainings were done on general data management, the use of reference managers, as well as Python scripts &minus; specifically to clean and report phenology data.

The co-PI's activities in Formosa have also led to collaborations with various UNaF professors; botanists regarding tree identification and newly registered plant species in Formosa, Dr. Juarez (primatologist) regarding a long-term seed bank/species conservation project, as well as forestry professors regarding general Chaco (canopy) ecology. The co-PI's professional relations at UNaF and her social network resulting from her Formosa-based research team strengthened her connection with people from the Gran Chaco, and her knowledge of the Gran Chaco ecosystem.

Despite setbacks caused by the pandemic, precluding the execution of certain field and lab components, we were able to preserve the scope and topic of this project by collaborating with various entities from which we obtained data as partial replacements for on-site data ('Planet' for satellite imagery, 'TRY' for species trait data). To deepen discussion, the co-PI has established a database (&gt;1000 records) on feeding information, including plant species and parts consumed, from all studied Aotus spp. across the Neotropics to which our results can be compared. She is furthermore broadening her dissertation by writing a reflective chapter on what the pandemic meant for research and forests in the Argentinean Gran Chaco. While the co-PI is still analyzing data and writing scientific articles, she has nearly finished a modelling approach to identify tree species &minus; based on traits like basal area and fruit crop &minus; as likely candidates of 'monogamy resources' under the resource defense hypothesis of monogamy. This included extended Python modelling of several rarity and dispersion indices, as well as a comprehensive measure of 'resource reliability.' The resulting Python code serves to a priori predict which tree species may help maintain primate monogamy but can more broadly be applied for primate conservation purposes at any site with vegetation data.

We furthermore disseminated our general research ideas and focus to the global tree climbing community at a joint event by the Global Organization of Tree Climbers (GOTC) and the Big Canopy Campout (BCC). Both organizations are non-profits with a shared goal to bring attention to the world's canopies. At the GOTC/BCC event the co-PI presented her vision of 'Primate Canopy Ecology' &minus; a bottom-up framework for studying primate ecology without habituating primate groups. She is slated to lead a workshop on 'sampling the canopy for researchers' at an in-person GOTC meeting in 2022, which is attracting many young canopy scientists from Asia and Central- and South America. We will continue to disseminate our research to the wider public through a bilingual GOTC blog post, a news item in CU Boulder Today, a presentation at a CU's undergraduate 'Anthro Club' meeting and climbs with Colorado Girl Scouts. More specific results will be disseminated at the International Primatological Society Meeting in Ecuador, an Ecological Society of America meeting, and at least one Argentinean ecology or primatology meeting, all in the year 2022. Griette van der Heide's dissertation is to be completed in the year 2022.

"Analyzing single neuron's property is a fundamental task to understand the nervous system and brain working mechanism. Investigating neuron morphology is an effective way to analyze neurons, since it plays a major role in determining neurons' properties. Recently, the ever-increasing neuron databases have greatly facilitated the research of neuron morphology. However, the sheer volume and complexity of these data pose significant challenges for computational analysis, preventing the realization of the full potential of such data. This interdisciplinary project will seek for new avenue to assemble the massive neuron morphologies and provide a unified framework for neuroscientists to explore and analyze different types of neurons. The research is able to tackle many challenges in neuroscience which are hard to solve with previous methods, including fine-grained neuron identification, latent pattern discovery and exploration, etc. The large-scale methods being developed will be particularly beneficial in the future of neuroscience, since more and more neurons are reconstructed and added to the databases. The computational methods and tools developed are very likely to be applicable for solving other bioinformatics problems, especially those dealing with large-scale datasets. The broader impact of this project not only includes educational support for undergraduate researchers and high school students, particularly women and those underrepresented groups, but also contributes to the research of neuroscience and other STEM fields.

The long-term goal of this project is to develop effective computational methods and tools for neuroscientists to interactively explore large-scale neuron databases with ultra-fine-grained accuracy, in real-time. This research has a strong multidisciplinary component that involves a nexus ideas from machine learning, information retrieval, and neuroinformatics. Particularly, novel ideas will be implemented in three inter-related components through the whole framework. The first one addresses the accurate and efficient neuron reconstruction and tracing based on deep learning models. The second addresses the efficient discovery of relevant instances among large-size neuron databases via multi-modal and online binary coding methods. The third part addresses intelligent visualization and interaction schemes for knowledge discovery and mining, equipped with interactive coding that can incorporate domain experts' feedback to enhance the query algorithms for fine-tuned results. Compared with previous methods and systems, this project will open a new avenue to assist neuroscientists analyzing and exploring large-scale neuron databases with high efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. The performance of proposed methods will be validated using public neuro-morphological databases (e.g., NeuroMorpho, BigNeuron) and compared with several benchmarks. The effectiveness of the tools to be developed will be evaluated by neuroscientists on domain-specific hypothesis-driven applications. The outcome of the project will be made available at the following websites: http://webpages.uncc.edu/~szhang16/  and https://github.com/divelab/.",NSF,Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station,TX,146452,2028361,sji@tamu.edu,Shuiwang,Ji,1,"Investigating the shapes of neurons is fundamental to understanding brain functions. This project studies neuron tracing, also known as neuron reconstruction, which aims at building 3D morphological structures of neurons from imaging data, such as laser scanning microscopy images. A major challenge is that laser scanning microscopy images usually have low signal-to-noise ratio and may contain discontinued segments of neurite patterns, making it challenging to perform tracing directly from raw microscopy images. This raises the need of an effective and automatic denoising algorithm to reduce the effect of noise and discontinued segments. In this project, we developed a set of novel deep learning methods for improving the performance of 3D neuron reconstruction from microscopy images. We treat the de-noising problem as an image transformation task in which deep models transform an input image into an output image. The models are trained to determine which voxels in 3D microscopy images belong to neurons. We developed both supervised and self-supervised deep learning methods for denoising images. We used imaging datasets from the BigNeuron project and other biological and natural images to evaluate our methods. Results show that our methods outperform prior methods and lead to improved performance on downstream tasks. Multiple high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students have been trained throughout this project.

"Mycobacterium tuberculosis has a global distribution and infects over a million new people each year. In the pre-contact Americas, tuberculosis (TB) infection was caused by a strain that is found today in seals and sea lions. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how a zoonotic strain of TB adapted to humans as a primary host and spread across the Americas. Throughout the project, undergraduate students at Arizona State University will be trained in genomic lab work and analysis, and the resulting datasets will be used to create undergraduate-level workshops. The research team will demonstrate an equitable international collaboration by fostering mutual understanding and inclusivity among affiliated parties, thereby facilitating long-term, innovative, and productive relationships between institutions.

The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) refers to a group of similar pathogens that cause TB infection in humans and animals. Genomes extracted from archaeological remains show that zoonotic lineages were responsible for human TB infections in the past. Most TB infections in humans today, however, are caused by M. tuberculosis, the human-adapted MTBC lineage. The evolutionary steps of an animal-adapted pathogen becoming a human-adapted pathogen are not entirely understood. The researchers will draw comparisons between modern and ancient MTBC genomes to understand better how zoonotic lineages of TB adapt to humans as primary hosts. Ancient MTBC genomes will be extracted from archaeological skeletons. The research team focuses on a densely populated city and trade epicenter to determine the breadth of genomic diversity of ancient circulating MTBC strains, some of which were likely imported through long-distance trade. As human populations expand and the interface between humans and wildlife narrows, understanding the genomic underpinnings of zoonotic transmission dynamics will inform public health surveillance measures. The results of these comparisons will help frame future epidemiological, evolutionary biology, and infectious disease research.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Arizona State University,AZ,31398,1945812,acstone@asu.edu,Anne,Stone,1,"The goal of this project was to detect and characterize tuberculosis (TB) infections in Tlatelolco, a densely populated city and marketplace in pre-conquest Mesoamerica. TB is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), a genetically similar group of pathogens. The MTBC includes M. tuberculosis, the primary cause of TB in humans, and animal-associated trains, such as M. bovis found in cows and M. pinnipedii found in seals and sea lions. TB was only recently surpassed by SARS-CoV-2 as the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. Although TB incidence has been declining, disrupted medical supply chains, overcrowded clinics and hospitals in at-risk areas, and co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 may cause cases to rise again. Given that TB is still a global public health threat today, we wanted to understand the long-term trajectory of the pathogen and how it impacted urban communities hundreds of years ago. 

There is an abundance of skeletal evidence that TB infected people in the Americas prior to European conquest. TB is primarily a pulmonary infection, but the bacteria can escape the lungs and target the skeletal system; the resulting damage to bones is identifiable in skeletons hundreds to thousands of years old. Since today TB infections in the Americas are generally caused by a European strain of M. tuberculosis, what strain of MTBC was causing TB in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans has been an enduring question. Research has shown that 1,000-year-old skeletons from Peru were infected with M. pinnipedii, the member of the MTBC associated with seals and sea lions. This suggests that humans contracted TB from seals and sea lions on the coasts of South America, where the archaeological records shows humans have been hunting, processing, and consuming them for millennia. 

For this project, we extracted DNA from over 60 skeletal elements with varying evidence of TB infection. Since DNA extraction from bone is destructive, first we wanted to see if there were any relationships among the age-at-death of the skeleton, the type of TB bone lesion, and ability to recover MTBC DNA so that in the future researchers may have a higher successful recovery rate and avoid unnecessary bone destruction. We found that the lumbar vertebrae of younger individuals with lytic lesions were the most likely to yield MTBC DNA. Additionally, we found that it is possible to sample the bone in a non-pathological area near a pathological lesion and recover MTBC DNA, minimizing damage to areas of the skeleton that are important for paleopathological and osteological analysis. 

We also expanded our understanding of the genetic diversity of MTBC in a pre-conquest city through the generation of an additional 11 whole and partial MTBC genomes. All 11 genomes are related to M. pinnipedii, but they are evolutionarily ""older"" than MTBC genomes from South America. Additionally, the MTBC strains at Tlatelolco are more genetically distinct from each other than MTBC strains recovered across multiple sites in Peru and Chile. This means that MTBC had been circulating in Mesoamerica for a long time and likely reflects the influx of people from around the Basin of Mexico and beyond into the Tlatelolco marketplace, possibly the largest in the Americas at the time. Further analyses will help us understand why such seemingly successful strains of MTBC were entirely replaced in human populations after the arrival of European strains. 

Our data provide new insights into the distribution and strain diversity of the MTBC in the Americas, but the unexpected relationship between South American and North American MTBC strains has led to more questions about the origin, zoonotic potential, and transmission pathways of pre-conquest MTBC. MTBC genomes from older human and non-human skeletons across the Americas will be key for understanding whether recurrent waves of zoonotic introduction and strain replacement in South America, an independent North American origin of MTBC in the Americas, or a mixture of both is the most likely scenario. Revealing trends and genetic determinants of the introduction, success, and replacement of zoonotic infections in humans across thousands of years provides a timely perspective on the potential of zoonoses. 

The broader impacts of this work included the training of the Co-PI in laboratory methods and computational analyses. Additionally, since ancient DNA extracts contain DNA from many organisms, the data we generated for this project is being used for additional projects investigating human genetic ancestry and oral health, all led by or in collaboration with colleagues at the Laboratorio Internacional de Investigaci&oacute;n sobre el Genoma Humano in Quer&eacute;taro, Mexico. Not only have we exemplified responsible ancient DNA research by performing destructive sampling once to produce data for several research projects, but also we have established an equitable collaboration with Mexican researchers that includes control of the research agenda, full participation of Mexican scientists and students, and freely shared data.

"Growth is a central aspect of a species’ biology, and modern humans are fundamentally different in the timing, duration, and pace of our growth compared to other primates. Understanding when and why the modern human growth pattern evolved is key to understanding part of what makes modern humans unique among primates. This doctoral dissertation project examines the links between variation in primate growth rates and hormonal underpinnings via the pituitary gland and a bony structure, the sella turcica. In doing so, it will develop a novel, non-destructive method for estimating individual growth rates and will investigate the effects of ecology and environment on living primates’ growth rates. The insights into pituitary and sella turcica growth and evolution provided by these data also have the potential to inform diagnoses of abnormal pituitary conditions and the etiology of growth deficiencies or diseases related to pituitary hormones. This project will support graduate training and undergraduate research experiences at Arizona State University (ASU), expanding educational opportunities and providing undergraduates with advanced visualization and 3D processing skills that can be applied to fields as varied as engineering and medicine. In addition, the researcher will communicate project findings through science education outreach activities for student and public audiences. 

Given the importance of growth, the ultimate causes (or selective pressures) that shape growth rates have long been the subject of research, but the proximate mechanisms that underpin variation in growth rates are less well studied. At the proximate level, body growth is the direct result of hormones produced by endocrine glands such as the pituitary. This project builds upon the relationship between the size of the pituitary, which is positively correlated with growth rate across mammalian taxa, and the sella turcica, the bony structure within which the pituitary gland is housed, to first test whether the size of the nonhuman primate sella turcica reflects body growth rate. This goal will be achieved by pairing 3D cranial morphology data with growth data from well-studied primate populations. Second, this research will assess how aspects of ecology and demography (i.e., ultimate causes such as resource availability, food quality, mortality) relate to living primates’ body growth rates both within the study populations and across a comparative sample of 51 species. It will then assess whether these ecological variables also explain variations in relative sella turcica size. Together, the complementary components of this project will contribute to a better understanding of primate growth.

It found that the environmental conditions experienced early in life are linked to the pace of growth (as well as achieved body size) in the Cayo Santiago macaque population. It also found that seasonal variation in vegetation is the strongest predictor of growth rate across primate species. This project further explored links between the ultimate drivers of variation in primate growth rate and their proximate (i.e., hormonal) underpinnings via a hard-tissue structure, the sella turcica. Analyses of sella turcica size across a sample of 51 primate species revealed that the relative size of the sella turcica is strongly positively correlated with postnatal growth rate, which suggests that sella turcica size may be useful for estimating somatic growth rate in species represented by cranial material. Together, the complementary components of this project contribute to a better understanding of the ultimate and proximate underpinnings of primate growth.

Intellectual merit

Growth is the background metronome against which other developmental events are framed, and the pattern and pace of growth are central aspects of a species? biology. Compared to other primates, modern humans are fundamentally different in the timing, duration, and pace of our growth. Understanding when and why the modern human growth pattern evolved is an active area of research within paleoanthropology. The results of this project suggest that non-destructive measurements of sella turcica size may be useful for estimating growth rate in fossil hominins. This research also provided insights into the effect of specific ecological conditions on growth rates in extant primates, which can help inform our understanding of the conditions that might have selected for modern humans? protracted growth and development.

Broader impacts

Although this project was inspired by paleoanthropological questions, it also has transdisciplinary implications for human health and veterinary care. The insights into pituitary and sella turcica growth and evolution provided by these data have the potential to inform diagnoses of abnormal pituitary conditions and the etiology of growth deficiencies or diseases related to pituitary hormones. The new CT data generated by this project will be made publicly available online and are broadly applicable to research that requires primate cranial data. The novel, non-destructive methods developed here can also be applied to studies of life history in non-hominin primates and non-primate fossil mammals. This project provided graduate training to the co-PI and helped her to refine her teaching, research, and mentoring skills. Undergraduate students from Arizona State University (ASU), a diverse public university, were trained to assist the co-PI in data collection. This expanded educational opportunities and provided these undergraduates with advanced visualization and processing skills that can be applied to fields as varied as engineering and medicine. The skills and insights into human and primate evolution that this project provided ultimately enriched the knowledge and perspective that the co-PI can transmit to the local and wider community through her involvement in public outreach programs.

"Fundamental research in human biology has provided insight into the complexity of breastfeeding as a unique form of maternal investment that is responsive to offspring cues, sensitive to environmental inputs, and capable of influencing short- and long-term offspring outcomes. While much of this research has focused on implications for infant physiology, comparatively little is known about the biological determinants and impacts of breastfeeding practices among mothers. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the maternal physiological dynamics of breastfeeding, advancing knowledge about the ways in which immune function, physiological status, and behavior are interrelated in humans. The research may also inform public health research and practice about breastfeeding behaviors. The project will facilitate graduate and undergraduate training and mentoring, and research outcomes will be shared with the participant community as well as a broader research and public audience. 

Few studies have directly examined the link between maternal immune function, maternal physiological status, and breastfeeding behavior in humans during the perinatal period. This study will longitudinally measure breastfeeding behavior, immunological biomarkers, and perceived physical and mental well-being among a heterogenous sample of pregnant and postpartum women in the United States, a population exhibiting unprecedented variation in breastfeeding behavior. The resulting data will be used to test two overarching hypotheses: (1) heightened inflammatory activation in late pregnancy will predict increased breastfeeding difficulties and impaired maternal physiological status, and (2) continuation of skin-to-skin breastfeeding across the early postpartum period will correspond to better regulated immune “bounce-back” and enhanced maternal physiological status. Findings generated by this study have the potential to inform current public health strategies to (1) identify mothers who may experience heightened barriers to breastfeeding success, (2) provide support for women to continue breastfeeding, and (3) support mental and physical maternal well-being during the transition from pregnancy to the postpartum period.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of California-Santa Barbara,CA,30934,1945759,boddy@anth.ucsb.edu,Amy,Boddy,1,"Due to the introduction of myriad breastfeeding alternatives (e.g., breast pumps, formula), the range of infant feeding behavior exhibited by mothers in the USA (and other post-industrial societies) is much wider than existed throughout most of human history. From an evolutionary perspective, replacement or heavy supplementation of at-the-nipple breastfeeding should be linked to dysregulated maternal immune recalibration, increased risk of sickness behavior (e.g., depression) and more symptoms of physical illness, due to evolutionary mismatch. On the other hand, mothers who sustain exclusive at-the-nipple breastfeeding for extended periods may experience diminishing returns on immune and health benefits due to increasing maternal-offspring conflict. In this context, moderating the degree of skin-to-skin breastfeeding may, to some degree and in a time-dependent manner, help mothers optimize their own immune status and health. We tested these predictions by collecting data on infant feeding behavior, biomarkers of inflammation, depressive symptoms, and self-reported physical health from a sample of postpartum mothers in the United States. We found that, in the early postpartum period, both at-the-nipple breastfeeding and pumping are associated with fewer symptoms of depression compared to other infant feeding methods. In the later postpartum period, however, pumping was associated with more symptoms of depression compared to breastfeeding. We found no association between at-the-nipple breastfeeding and physical symptoms, but observed a consistent positive relationship between pumping and symptoms of physical illness (especially among mothers in later postpartum period). This pattern was the opposite of what we predicted, indicating that the protective effect of at-the-nipple breastfeeding remains stable over time while the benefits of pumping are limited to the first several months after delivery. In addition, both at-the-nipple breastfeeding and pumping corresponded with attenuated morning peak in inflammatory markers - even in the relative absence of pathogen exposure. Taken together, these patterns provide evidence that both at-the-nipple breastfeeding and pumping downregulate inflammatory processes, especially in the early postpartum period. In sum, these findings suggest that mothers who exhibit greater reliance on at-the-nipple breastfeeding (and, in certain contexts, pumping/expressing breastmilk) may enjoy certain health benefits. It is also possible that the causal pathway goes in the other direction - lower inflammatory activation and fewer depressive and physical symptoms may promote greater breastmilk production. Future research is needed to further parse out these pathways.

"This doctoral dissertation project will examine the quantity and path of nerves that run through the jaws and teeth of mammals to establish if the size of these nerves is related to diet. The investigator will focus on humans and non-human primates, to determine if different diets correspond to the concentration of soft tissues (like nerves, arteries, and veins) in specific sections of the mouth and teeth. The research will advance knowledge about the relationships between soft tissues, bony tissues, jaw function, and diet, and may also inform our understanding of craniomandibular plasticity in modern humans. The project will support undergraduate and graduate STEM training, create an open, online database of scan data, and be used in a variety of science outreach projects and blog posts aimed at K-12 and general public audiences. 

Primates use sensory mechanisms to choose foods based on color, taste, size, and texture. These sensory mechanisms are controlled by nerves in the skin, eyes, mouth, teeth, and other structures that allow a primate to determine if a food is safe for eating. The primary nerves that supply sensation to the mouth are branches of the trigeminal nerve that pass through the maxilla and mandible. Previous research indicates that larger nerves relay more sensory information at faster speeds, suggesting that it is important to know the size of nerves to understand their functions. It has also been established that primate diets are intimately tied to tooth shape and chewing function, suggesting that the properties of teeth and their accompanying nerves are selected for simultaneously in relation to how they sense the properties (i.e., toughness, stiffness) of foods. The proposed work will use microCT scanning and iodine staining methods to examine the relationship between tooth shape and the nerves of teeth, with a focus on how these structures vary in relation to primate diets. Teeth of primates that are adapted to leaf- or insect-eating are predicted to need more nerves in the back of the mouth (under the molars), while fruit-eating primates are expected to have more nerves at the front of the mouth. This hypothesis is supported by data showing that individuals eating tougher diets manipulate food objects within their mouth more than individuals that consume softer food objects. This manipulation is partly due to how primates use nerves to assess material properties of an object to ensure that the individual does not damage their teeth during chewing.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Arkansas,AR,29800,1944642,cterhune@uark.edu,Claire,Terhune,1,"Primates use sensory mechanisms to choose foods based on color, size, and texture. These sensory mechanisms are controlled by nerves in the skin, eyes, mouth, and teeth that allow a primate to determine if a food is safe for eating. A branch of the trigeminal nerve ? the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) ? is responsible for detecting the textures of food as you chew, and especially helps to protect your teeth from damage. Previous research shows that larger nerves relay more sensory information at faster speeds, indicating that it is important to know the size of nerves to understand their functions. It has also been established that the diet of a primate is related to tooth form and chewing, suggesting that the size and shape of teeth and their accompanying nerves may be closely related. This study used microCT scans (133 individuals, 40 primate species, 5 non-primate mammals) and iodine staining methods to examine the relationship between tooth shape and nerves, with a focus on how these structures are different in primates that eat different foods. This research is the first to examine the variation we see in the nerves that help control chewing across a wide range of primates and to explore the evolutionary relationships between groups, helping us to better understand dietary differences. 

 This research focused on three major questions that evaluate the relationships between the hard and soft tissue components in the oral cavity that are related to chewing and diet. First, we examined relationships between size and shape of the tooth crown, the tooth root surface area, and size of the IAN. Second, we examined the relationship between the IAN and the mandibular canal (through which the IAN is transmitted inside the lower jaw). Third, we examined the relationship between the IAN and primate diets. Results indicate that, while the size of the root and crown of each tooth are closely related to each other, there is no relationship between the shape of the crown and root size, nor were there relationships between IAN size and either crown or root properties. In other words, nervous tissue volume is not related to the size and shape of the teeth. Second, this work found that in most primate species (74.9%) there is no defined mandibular canal running through the mandible. Further, when a canal can be identified, the IAN rarely accounts for more than 60% of the total canal space. Finally, we found that there is no relationship between the size of the IAN and primate diets. 

 While the nervous and chewing systems of primates have been studied extensively, no research has ever addressed the relationships described here. This work has advanced the field of anthropology by showing that the IAN is closely related to the overall size of the lower jaw and is not under the same selective dietary pressures that have been found for the teeth. Additionally, this research strongly suggests that bony canals cannot be used to estimate the size and shape of all soft tissues that are housed within them.

 The broader impacts of this research are varied. First, this research trained three undergraduate researchers in digital anatomical methods, the care and maintenance of a soft tissue collection, and provided training in scientific analysis and writing. Second, all microCT scans generated in this research will be made publicly available on morphosource.org (an open-source database) to promote open access communication and future innovation in the scientific community. Finally, this study can help to improve society by adding a large volume of data on the nerves of the chewing system, which is relevant for better understanding the function of the chewing system and potentially has applications in dentistry.

"Antimicrobial resistance, now considered a pressing public health concern, has propagated into the microbial communities of urban and natural environments around the world. Only recently has antimicrobial resistance been identified as an environmental contaminant and ecological concern; its impacts on wildlife and their environments remain relatively unknown. This doctoral dissertation project will characterize and quantify antimicrobial resistance in a primate species and its habitats, across different environmental conditions. Beyond contextualizing antimicrobial resistance in an endangered species and vulnerable landscape, this research will highlight the potential for transmission of resistant bacteria between hosts, including humans, and their environments. With far-reaching value for nonhuman primate conservation and husbandry, the results of this study will be shared with the scientific community (via collaborations, presentations, attendance of domestic and international conferences, and publications) and with the public (via science education and outreach).

Although revolutionary for modern society, the ubiquitous use of antibiotics has resulted in the rapid development of antimicrobial resistance genes that persist in bacterial genomes, can be transferred to other microbes, and may be proliferating environmental reservoirs of resistance. Animals can acquire resistant bacteria either through exposure to direct antibiotic administration (e.g., through veterinary care) or to environments contaminated with antibiotics or resistance bacteria. Once incorporated into host-associated communities, known as microbiomes, resistant bacteria disrupt the symbiotic roles of commensal microbes and diminish the host’s immune function. Current understanding about the transmission and impacts of resistance derives primarily from studies of humans and clinically prominent animal models (i.e., laboratory rodents). To better understand and combat the ubiquitous ‘resistance crisis’ on a more comprehensive scale, a broader, ecological framework is necessary. The Co-PI’s dissertation research is focused on assessing antimicrobial resistance as a novel facet of anthropogenic disturbance that differentially impacts lemurs living along a gradient of disturbance (i.e., ranging from minimally to greatly disturbed natural habitats and captive settings). Using next-generation sequencing techniques, this project has three specific aims: to determine the abundance of antimicrobial resistance in (1) the gut microbiome of lemurs, (2) representative environmental microbiomes (from soil and water) across the lemurs’ habitats, and (3) the gut microbiome of lemurs directly experiencing acute and cumulative antibiotic exposure. By studying varying disturbances in lemurs and their environments, we will determine specific sources of antimicrobial resistance and highlight the resistance crisis as an ecological and conservation concern with the potential to impact wildlife worldwide.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Duke University,NC,32195,1945776,cdrea@duke.edu,Christine,Drea,1,"Antibiotic resistance is increasingly recognized as an ecological and conservation concern, one that has been precipitated by burgeoning human presence and activity in natural environments. The consequences of antibiotic resistance, however, have largely been studied from the perspective of preserving human health, with relatively little investigation into the risk to wildlife and natural ecosystems. In this project, we characterized antibiotic resistance in multiple populations of wild and captive ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) that were exposed to varying types and degrees of anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., antibiotic treatment, habitat degradation, direct contact with humans). Additionally, we explored whether or not antibiotic resistance genes were shared between lemurs and the soils in their environments. We used a combination of high-throughput, next-generation sequencing techniques, paired with microbial source-tracking software to identify antibiotic resistance genes and their potential bidirectional transmission pathways between lemurs and the environment. This research has important implications for the health and management of animals under human care, as well as for the conservation of wildlife and their environments.

 

Notably, we found that lemurs experiencing greater anthropogenic disturbance harbored greater proportions of antibiotic resistance genes, including those that are clinically relevant to human health. In wild lemurs, agricultural activities and human presence were drivers of resistance gene prevalence, whereas in captive lemurs, antibiotic treatment and direct human contact determined resistance gene enrichment. In lemurs receiving antibiotic treatment, resistance genes appeared to increase during and persist after treatment, a pattern that was diminished if the lemur received a fecal microbiota transplant following antibiotic treatment. In one population of captive lemurs, antibiotic resistance genes were universally present, including in animals that had never received antibiotic treatment, indicating social or environmental acquisition of clinically relevant resistance genes. We further found that the types of resistance genes present in different lemur populations reflected specific antibiotic uses by nearby human populations. In wild lemur populations that had experienced greater exposure to anthropogenic disturbance, resistance genes were shared between lemurs and their environments, suggesting that resistance genes can be transmitted between humans, wildlife, and the environment.

 

Together, these results indicate that human activity underlies the propagation of antibiotic resistance in natural ecosystems and that captive and wild animals can be reservoirs of clinically relevant resistance genes. Importantly, by identifying factors that govern antibiotic resistance in different environments, this research has highlighted actionable steps to minimize resistance propagation, namely by conserving natural, undisturbed ecosystems and preventing human-wildlife contact. It has also provided preliminary insight into the potential benefits of microbial therapies, such as fecal microbiota transplants, in mitigating the development and spread of antibiotic resistance in animals treated with or exposed to antibiotics. In addition to providing an ecological framework for concepts that have largely been studied within clinical settings, this research expands our understanding of the ?resistance crisis? and begins to address the recent and urgent calls to better incorporate microbial ecology into animal care and conservation.

 

Beyond the dissemination of this research at academic conferences and in peer-reviewed publications, we presented these results in multiple venues, including to K-12 and undergraduate students as well as to animal care professionals and veterinarians. Throughout the project, multiple students were trained in laboratory and/or field protocols, including two Duke University undergraduate students who completed their honors research and graduated with distinction, as well as two Malagasy field assistants. This research sparked numerous professional development opportunities, including a collaboration between Dr. Bornbusch and the Smithsonian?s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, culminating in Dr. Bornbusch co-leading a Smithsonian One Health internship for high school, undergraduate, and masters students.

"Skeletal remains are important sources of information on temporal trends in human health. Porous cranial lesions (PCLs) are interpreted as indicators of nutrient deficiencies and chronic infections and are among the most common pathological findings in human skeletal remains. This doctoral dissertation project uses methods previously applied primarily in archaeological contexts to investigating the causes of PCLs and the health of individuals who live with them. Specifically, the researchers will use an archaeological reference sample to develop computed tomography (CT) criteria for identifying PCLs in living individuals. They will then link measures of individual health to PCL findings from existing CT scans of a living population. Protocols and tools developed for PCL analysis will be made freely available online. The project will strengthen institutional capacity for future research collaborations and support STEM student training at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Because PCLs are developed during childhood, the methods developed in this proposal will have implications for public health across the lifespan. 

PCLs in archaeological samples have been interpreted as evidence of both stress and resilience. This project attempts to resolve this ambiguity by leveraging existing data drawn from a living population to test the association of PCLs in the orbits (cribra orbitalia) and the cranial vault (porotic hyperostosis) with known health profiles. First, the researchers will develop a protocol to extend archaeological methods to determining the prevalence of PCLs in a living population. Specifically, investigators will employ both visual assessments of CT scans and machine learning to reliably identify the presence and extent of PCLs on cranial CT scans using a reference sample of archaeological crania (n = 600). Once developed, investigators will apply the protocol to identify PCLs on existing cranial CTs of 1,310 living adults with known health profiles. This will link childhood development of PCLs to measures of later life health, including biological markers, medical diagnoses, and self-reported wellness. Finally, this project tests the common interpretation of PCLs as indicators of childhood anemia. Using biological markers from dried blood spot samples from children in the same population of living individuals (n = 480), investigators will identify the underlying causes of individual anemia cases and test their association with a biological marker of active bone remodeling.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of California-Santa Barbara,CA,31044,1945794,gurven@anth.ucsb.edu,Michael,Gurven,1,"This project was the first study to examine porous cranial lesions in the bones of the orbits (cribra orbitalia) and cranial vault (cribra cranii) in a population-representative sample of living people. These lesions are commonly reported by archaeologists as skeletal indicators of childhood stress, who attribute them to either infectious or nutritional causes in early life.

We first tested the sensitivity and accuracy of clinical computed tomography scans for identifying cranial lesions in living people by scanning archaeological crania with a range of lesion presentations. We found that moderate to severe cases of cranial porosity could be reliably documented from CT scans using settings intended to diagnose cranial fractures.  

We then evaluated existing head scans of adults aged 40+ years from the Tsimane population of Bolivia for cranial lesions presumably developed in early childhood. Using twenty years of health data from the Tsimane Health and Life History Project, we investigated the relationship between 1) cranial lesions and childhood health and 2) cranial lesions and morbidity in later life.

We found that cranial lesions were not associated with other measures of childhood illness or growth disruption (memories of childhood sickness; leg length relative to total height). However, we do find that shared childhood household is an independent predictor of lesion status, supporting the idea that childhood environment plays a role in the development of these skeletal lesions.

There is some evidence that cribra orbitalia is associated with immunocompromise in Tsimane adults, suggesting lifelong health consequences of lesion-causing processes in early life. Cribra orbitalia is associated with lower measures for some markers of adaptive immunity (fewer B cells, na?ve CD4+ T cells, and a lower ratio of total CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells) and with a greater risk of developing active tuberculosis. Cribra cranii, on the other hand, predicts double the risk of headaches but is not associated with notable differences in physiological measures.

We also assayed dried blood spots from Tsimane children for measures of iron deficiency (serum transferrin receptor), inflammation (C-reactive protein), and skeletal activity (osteocalcin) to investigate relationships between nutrient deficiency, infection, and processes of skeletal change during childhood. At the time of writing analyses are still underway, but initial explorations show a negative relationship between iron levels and skeletal activity, perhaps suggesting that childhood anemia, a known cause of cranial changes, is not the predominant cause of porous cranial lesions in this population.

"In this doctoral dissertation project, the investigator will use whole genome sequencing to examine how genetic networks encompassing hundreds of genes involved in regulating social behavior have evolved across sifakas, a behaviorally and ecologically diverse group of lemurs. This research will provide new insights about the genomic contributions to social behavioral evolution, and advance knowledge about the complex interplay of genetics, ecology, and the social environment in shaping primate behavior. The project may inform public health research, as some genetic pathways investigated in this project have also been implicated in the development and expression of various psychiatric illnesses. The project will also support primate conservation efforts, research and training opportunities, and research infrastructure at the study locations. The investigator will make all of their data publicly available, thereby providing additional research opportunities beyond the scope of this project. 

Many previous studies into the influences of genetics on social behavior have focused on examining single or few candidate genes and often only protein-coding portions of those genes. Here the researchers will take a whole genome sequencing approach to holistically examine the evolution of genomic regions involved in the development and expression of social behavior (i.e. ""sociogenomic"" regions) in sifakas. The researchers will generate a whole genome sequence for each of the eight sifaka species without a current reference genome. They will also sequence a woolly lemur individual to be able to identify genetic sequences that are unique to sifakas. Subsequently, they will subset the whole genome sequences to sociogenomic regions and examine their evolution. The researchers will specifically examine: (1) Whether sociogenomic regions have been significantly conserved across sifakas, indicative of evolutionary constraint (2) Evidence of selection acting on protein-coding portions of sociogenomic regions relative to differences in sifaka social and ecological environments and (3) The presence of accelerated evolution occurring in regions potentially involved in regulating the expression of sociogenomic genes.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Massachusetts Amherst,MA,20499,1919663,jkamilar@anthro.umass.edu,Jason,Kamilar,1,"Primates, including and epitomized by humans, are highly social creatures. How primate social behavior has evolved and the forces that have shaped it into the many forms sociality takes across over 500 primate species has long been a source of fascination among biologists. In this project, we investigated the evolution of social behavior of sifakas, a group of lemur species. We combined decades of behavioral and ecological data collected on wild sifakas by field primatologists. We first examined how the nine sifaka species vary in their social group traits, such as how large their groups are and how many males and females they contain. We then examined how variation in those social traits correlates to the ecological conditions the different sifaka species find themselves in. Echoing previous work on lemur behavioral ecology, we found multiple signs that the harsh ecological conditions of Madagascar impose high costs on the social lives of sifakas. Across species, sifakas have responded to these conditions by living in flexible social groups.

Next we are investigating how the interactions between sifaka social behavior and ecology are reflected in the evolution of their genomes. We?ve sequenced 27 high-quality whole genome sequences across all sifaka species and one species of closely related woolly lemur. In combination with additional whole genome sequences that have recently become available via the published work of others, we are working with a comprehensive set of 37 whole genomes. This is a powerful dataset that we?re incredibly excited to continue working with in order to explore the potential role of genetics in regulating primate social behavior. We will next be inferring an updated sifaka phylogeny, using the power of the whole genome to update our understanding of how the sifaka species are related to each other. This updated sifaka phylogeny will let us frame our understanding of sifaka social behavior and ecology within the context of their deep evolutionary history. Finally, we are examining how different evolutionary forces like selection have acted on thousands of sifaka genes. These genes are involved in regulating neural and hormonal processes that have been found to influence social behavior across animals.

Intellectual Merits

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the signatures of social behavior evolution across the whole genome in primates. We are excited for what we may learn about the relative contributions made by both genetics and the environment to the evolution of primate social behavior. Our study further underscores the social environment ? the types of groups individuals find themselves within and how individuals interact within groups ? as a nexus of the primate variation and adaptation. We also highlight the power of combining traditional approaches within behavioral ecology with comparative genomics to attain a holistic understanding of primate social evolution. Lemurs are an especially important group of primates for these lines of inquiry. Since lemurs retain various ancestral primate traits, studies like this project can provide important insights into early primate behavioral evolution which is notoriously difficult to do with the fossil record.

The comprehensive dataset of high-quality sifaka whole genome sequences developed for this project is a powerful tool for understanding the evolutionary history, behavioral ecology, and conservation dynamics of not just sifakas. Comparable datasets are currently available for only three other groups of primates: the great apes, baboons, and snub-nosed monkey. These are all Catarrhines (Old World monkeys and apes). This study thus makes an important contribution in generating a comparative genomic dataset for a group of the more distantly related Strepsirrhine primates that will be an important piece of the burgeoning field of primate comparative genomics.

Broader Impacts

This project required the development of several comparative datasets on sifaka behavior and ecology, collating information from over 100 primary sources. These data describe sifaka social behavior and ecology at multiple levels including across sifaka species, different populations within the same sifaka species, and among individual groups of sifakas as well. These data have never before been collated into one organized database. This sifaka database continues to be updated and will be made available via a web portal for download once all analyses are complete. Other researchers will also be able to make contributions to it, and the database will be an invaluable resource for both teaching and continued examinations into primate behavior, ecology, and evolution. Preliminary results from this project have already been shared with a variety of academic and non-academic audiences.

Additionally, the results of this study have a special bearing on the conservation of sifakas, all of which are endangered, some even critically endangered. The whole genome data sequenced for this project should prove especially invaluable for sifaka conservation, as they are a powerful tool for examining the population history, genetic diversity, and adaptability of these endangered Malagasy primates.

"Humans evolved very large brains relative to their body size, with a remarkable enrichment of neurons in the cerebral cortex. Extensive efforts in anthropology have focused on delineating the adaptive pressures that led to these changes during human evolution. However, the genetic changes underlying human brain expansion have not been fully explored. This project will test hypotheses about human brain evolution by studying the impact of human genetic variation on brain development using experimental models. This research has broad implications for understanding what makes the human brain unique at the cellular and molecular levels, with translational value for medical treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. During this research, undergraduate students pursuing careers in STEM will be mentored and trained in molecular biology and bioinformatics techniques in the laboratory. Research findings will be used as 1) an educational tool for spreading knowledge about human evolution and genetics with the general public, K-12 students, and undergraduate students, as well as 2) a motivational platform for the young, future women scientists in the Females Excelling More in Mathematics, Engineering and Science (FEMMES) Program. 

The proposed research takes a multi-disciplinary approach to investigate how human evolutionary history has shaped the molecular and physiological mechanisms of human brain expansion. In the laboratory, human and non-human primate neural cells will be studied to explore how genetic variation evolved in humans to shape the developing brain. This project uses a combination of gene editing, RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry to determine the functional role of human-specific genetic sequence during brain development that corresponds to changes in brain size. These findings will advance the understanding of the molecular evolution of the human brain.

Research in anthropology has helped delineate the adaptive pressures on brain expansion during our evolution. However, the genetics underlying human brain expansion, favored by natural selection, have not been well-explored. Prime candidates for the evolution of human brain expansion are genes that are unique to humans, disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders, and expressed in neural progenitor cells (NPCs)?the cells that build the brain by determining the number of neurons. In this study, we investigate the function of candidate NBPF genes, which have expanded in number in primate genomes and exceptionally in the human genome (Figure 1). This project experimentally tests hypotheses about human molecular origins by investigating the impact of human-specific genes on the development of the human cerebral cortex as well as establish a functional model for studying brain evolution. 

            Human and chimpanzee in vitro brain organoids?3D structures differentiated from stem cells that mimic in vivo brains?provide an unprecedented opportunity to generate functional data on how human-specific genetic changes shape the developing brain. Here, we used a two-step strategy to investigate the genetics of human cortical expansion: 1) gene editing to evaluate the effect of rapidly evolved human-specific genes in human brain organoids, and 2) genetic introduction of human genes into chimpanzee organoids to identify developmental mechanisms that determine cortex size.

            Expression of NBPF proteins has changed throughout primate evolution, resulting in novel expression of human NBPF proteins in NPCs. In this study, we found that NBPF proteins localize to the cytoplasm in human NPCs and show peak expression at microtubules during cell division (Figure 2). Compared to human NPCs, chimpanzee NPCs express very low levels of NBPF protein. We found evidence that NBPF proteins interact with each other, as well as other proteins that are important for cytoskeleton dynamics and communication with the extracellular matrix in human NPCs (Figure 3). Disruption to these aspects of cell biology during brain development can lead to clinical microcephaly (abnormally small brain). 

            Dynamic balance between NPC proliferation and differentiation informs neuronal identity and number. To investigate the role of human-specific NBPF in brain development, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing to deplete the expression of NBPF protein in NPCs. Using human brain organoid models, we observed a significant decrease in the number of proliferating cells, resulting in smaller organoids (Figure 4). In addition, NPCs in NBPF-depleted organoids started to differentiate to neurons earlier than control organoids, which acts to reduce the number of total neurons. Altogether, our findings support the hypothesis that NBPFs in human brain development influence NPC activity that is important to build a human brain. 

            Findings from this work have important implications for addressing interdisciplinary questions about human brain evolution as well as the role of NBPF proteins in neurodevelopmental disorders. This project has offered great opportunities for science communication and outreach locally and nationally, as well as mentorship and training.

"Nutritional and energetic models of human metabolism assume that all dietary fats have the same caloric value. However, recent developments in gut microbiome research have challenged this view, with gut microbial communities shifting in response to different fat-rich diets, and the resulting gut microbiota differentially impacting energy gain. This dissertation project will examine the role of dietary fat types on energy gain from a human holobiont perspective, which interrogates both host and microbial mechanisms of energy harvest from different dietary fat sources. By assessing the impact of dietary fat type on host-microbial interactions, the investigators aim to better understand the process of dietary fat metabolism in ancestral and modern humans, to challenge traditional models of the isocaloric nature of fats, and to gain insight into associations between dietary fat intake and increasing rates of metabolic disease in industrial populations. Apart from contributing to the peer-reviewed scientific literature, this research will facilitate undergraduate research opportunities, particularly for women and underrepresented minorities in science, who presently comprise 80% of the laboratory research staff. In addition, through connections with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, the investigators have committed to contributing to programs that make science accessible for a broad public audience. 

The trillions of microbes that reside in the human gut are now understood to play important roles in digestion and energy regulation. However, to date, models of past and present human energy budgets have not considered the microbial contributions to energy harvested from diet. In this research, the investigators will probe mechanisms of dietary fat metabolism that involve both host and microbial processes, evaluating the impacts of different dietary fats on host energy budget, intestinal fat absorption and inflammation, gut microbial composition, and direct gut microbial contributions to host energy status. To address these processes, the investigators will use conventional and germ-free murine models, which are routinely used for studying the effects of microbial community shifts on human physiology. This research will clarify the role that different dietary fats have played in the evolution of human energy metabolism, and will suggest new pathways for targeting the high and rising rates of obesity, type II diabetes, and other metabolic diseases in the industrialized world.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Harvard University,MA,33800,1919892,carmody@fas.harvard.edu,Rachel,Carmody,1,"While dietary fat has played an important role in shaping modern human physiology, surprisingly little is known about the metabolic processes involved in fat digestion. Modern nutrition guidelines treat the energetic contribution of fat as equal regardless of fat type. However, this framework of fat metabolism does not adequately explain why differences in dietary fat are linked to such varying metabolic health outcomes, particularly in the case of obesity. One potential contributor to these discrepancies is the gut microbiome. Recent advances in microbiome research have shed light on the digestive partnership between humans and our resident gut microbes, and evidence suggests that gut microbes respond rapidly and reproducibly to dietary shifts, including changes in fat consumption. Therefore, in order to understand the impacts of dietary fat type on host energy gain and metabolic health, we must consider the role of host-microbial interactions in fat metabolism.

This research addresses whether different dietary fat types alter metabolic phenotypes via host and microbial mechanisms, and investigates the extent to which the gut microbial community plays a direct role in shaping host phenotype under different dietary fat conditions. In a series of mouse experiments, we explored the potential host-microbial interactions involved in a holobiont view of dietary fat metabolism. We first determined the role of dietary fat type in shaping host energy gain and metabolic response in conventional mice, including metrics of fat digestion and absorption. We then explored how the metabolic effects of fat type induce downstream changes to the structure and function of the gut microbiome. Finally, we used germ-free and gnotobiotic mouse models to examine the direct gut microbial contributions to host physiology under different dietary fat conditions. 

In experimental feeding trials using C57BL/6J mice, isocaloric high-fat diets that vary in fat type resulted in significantly different effects on total body mass and percent adiposity, particularly when comparing saturated versus &omega;-3 polyunsaturated fat sources. Dietary fats associated with enhanced energy gain were also associated with increased host expression of markers for bile acid production, inflammatory response, and gut epithelial integrity. Dietary fat type also impacted downstream gut microbial community composition and abundance. High-fat diets associated with upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and gut epithelial integrity genes corresponded with the enrichment of microbial taxa implicated in enhanced energy harvest, inflammation, and gut epithelial homeostasis. When assessing the extent to which the gut microbiota can directly influence host energy gain from different dietary fats, gnotobiotic transplant experiments determined that dietary preconditioning in donor mice amplified the energy harvesting capacity of the microbiota in recipient mice consuming the same dietary fat type.

This work sheds light on mechanistic variation in how different fats are digested, supports the role of host-microbial interactions in fat metabolism, and advocates for re-evaluating estimates of energy gain from fats in ancestral and modern human diets. Considering the scope of these interactive pathways also provides an essential lens for our understanding of human evolution and the role of dietary fat in shaping human phenotypes. By determining the impacts of differences in both dietary fat level and type on the holobiont, we can develop a better understanding of how human-microbial interactions may contribute to diet-associated metabolic disease in industrialized populations.

This project has facilitated opportunities for advising undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds in pursuit of research experiences and senior thesis projects, and has led to student co-authorship on forthcoming publications. The interdisciplinary nature of this project has also encouraged broad public engagement through educational outreach at the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, and promoted scientific discourse across a range of disciplines, from nutritional epidemiology to evolutionary medicine.

"Old World monkeys are found across Africa and Asia today with various physical and behavioral adaptations that allow them to survive and coexist in a range of habitats. Fossils from Africa show a similar pattern of Old World monkey diversity and coexistence in the past, although not all of these fossil species survived to the present. This doctoral dissertation project will examine how Old World monkey communities change in response to local environmental conditions and why some species within these communities are more successful than others. Dental features associated with dietary adaptations will be used to reconstruct the ecologies of living and fossil Old World monkeys and to compare across communities from different temporal and geographic settings. This will provide long-term context for understanding the present-day diversity of Old World monkey communities and for predicting potential responses of these communities to ongoing and future environmental change. This project will directly engage undergraduates in research, including students from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM. Photographs and measurement data will be made freely available online to other researchers; they will also be used to create written articles and educational materials shared with local schools and museums, and posted online for the general public on the AskAnAnthropologist.asu.edu website.

A range of climatic, ecological, biogeographical, and phylogenetic hypotheses have been proposed to explain how and why present-day primate communities contain certain combinations of species and adaptations. This project uses a broad temporal and geographic sample of Old World monkey communities in Africa and Asia today and in the African fossil record to systematically test hypotheses linking species diversity, adaptation, and extinction with local environmental phenomena. Dental metric data will be used to create a multivariate model of the Old World monkey ecomorphological niche, from which the researchers will calculate and compare community niche volumes, positions, and overlap. Model selection will then be used to evaluate the relative influence of climate factors, habitat structure, mammalian competition, and dispersal barriers in leading communities to have similar or distinct ecomorphological niches. As Old World monkeys are well-represented in the fossil and present-day communities, they provide an ideal model for understanding complex patterns of diversity and extinction in the past, present, and future.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Arizona State University,AZ,16609,1926163,kaye.reed@asu.edu,Kaye,Reed,1,"We developed a model based on measurement data from the teeth to understand patterns of co-occurrence and community evolution from monkeys living in modern sites in Africa and Asia and from the fossil record of Africa. This model was tested against data on species dietary resource use in living monkey species, which confirmed that the dental model accurately reflected patterns of ecological diversity in these communities. We then gathered data on modern and past climate systems and habitat types to analyze the relative impacts of these factors in shaping patterns of monkey community diversity today.

Based on the dental model, we found that monkey communities in Asia today are structured by geography and past climate systems. This is consistent with other research that suggests that monkey communities in this region have been strongly affected by changing sea levels that would have opened up or closed off connections between islands and limited the ability of species to travel and form new communities. In Africa today, monkey communities are instead influenced by modern and recent rainfall patterns. We did not find any strong effects of modern human activity on monkey community structure, despite our expectations.

Fossil monkey communities in Africa were similar to their modern counterparts in Africa and Asia, particularly those that are found in more seasonal or temperate habitats. In the dental model, these fossil communities were shown to be different from modern sites based on having multiple large-bodied species present, including some large leaf-eating monkeys that are unlike any found in Africa or Asia today. This is opposite the pattern found in many African communities today that may have multiple small-bodied species found together, but only one or two large-bodied species at each site. Fossil sites were also generally similar to one another except in some comparisons between older and younger sites, and between sites found in East vs. South Africa. This suggests that these communities may have been similar to modern Asian communities in being limited by species' abilities to travel between the different regions or changes as they evolved through time.

Our results confirm that environments in the past were likely different from any found today in that they could support many larger-bodied primate species that co-existed on the landscape. This is broadly consistent other research on fossil communities and on specific mammal groups such as carnivores and large herbivores, and this also matches the pattern we see in the human fossil record. We hope that we or other future researchers can integrate our dental model of monkey communities with comparable data on other mammals to better understand how species have evolved together over the past several million years in Africa, and how that contributes to patterns of diversity we see around the globe today.

During this process, she also mentored two undergraduate students who assisted with data collection and trained in aspects of research design, database management, and data analysis in Excel.

"This doctoral dissertation research will assess the impact of historical decision-making processes on the Biological Anthropology collections at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History (NMNH). In addition to being snapshots of once living populations, biological anthropology collections are valuable repositories of past anthropologists' collection management strategies. The legacies and decisions, like ones made by Ales Hrdlicka at the NMNH, changed how collections of human remains were formed, accessioned, and cared for in museums. Understanding how collections were treated in the past will help museums make informed decisions about destructive sampling requests, allow researchers to optimize study design, and help to establish museum care standards with modern scientific methods (e.g. DNA sequencing) in mind. This project will contribute to STEM education by providing training opportunities for undergraduates through the Smithsonian Fellowship Program and Co-PI Austin's dissertation research. Additionally, the public will be engaged at events like the ""Expert Is In"" talk series at the NMNH, presentations at the NMNH and department presentations at the University of Oklahoma.

To investigate the impact of changing collection care strategies on biological anthropology collections, this project will focus on biomolecular (DNA) preservation in dental calculus (calcified plaque). Dental calculus from anthropological collections has been used to address important questions concerning the health, diet, and population dynamics of past peoples. However, variation in dental calculus development and preservation across human populations is underexplored. By taking into consideration multiple lines of evidence (i.e. ancient DNA sequencing, skeletal and morphological data, and archival information) from temporally and geographically representative collections, this study will investigate 1) how environmental factors contribute to dental calculus formation and 2) how collection care decisions by past biological anthropologists have affected the long-term storage of collections. As a world-leading museum, the NMNH offers extraordinary collections with spatial and temporal depth to address these two objectives and will provide valuable information to other collections around the world.

Consideration of historic preparation and preservation techniques is especially important when working with human remains and maintaining respect for the deceased individual(s). To investigate the impact of changing collection care strategies on biological anthropology collections, this project focused on DNA preservation in dental calculus (calcified plaque). Dental calculus from anthropological collections has been used to address important questions concerning the health, diet, and population dynamics of past peoples. By taking into consideration multiple lines of evidence (i.e. ancient DNA sequencing, skeletal and morphological data, and archival information) from temporally and geographically representative collections, this study investigated how collection care decisions by past biological anthropologists have affected the long-term preservation of collections’ biomolecules through the assessment of ancient DNA metagenomics from dental calculus.

Project results identified dental calculus across all collections, revealing the presence of dental calculus to be innate to the human oral cavity. The amount of dental calculus observed varied across individuals and populations (collections). Unfortunately, assessing differences among the amount of dental calculus and environmental depositional factors (e.g. diet, social structure, etc.) was obscured by postmortem processing and handling. Post-mortem dental calculus removal by curators/collection staff was observable.

In addition to being snapshots of once living populations, this project emphasizes and identifies biological anthropology collections as valuable repositories of past anthropologists’ collection management strategies. Archival data revealed the unique histories of each collection&mdash;no two were the same, even though several were prepared for anatomical study at similar times. Curatorial decisions, like ones made by Ale&scaron; Hrdli&#269;ka at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), directed how collections of human remains were formed, accessioned, and cared for in museums.

Mirroring the collection-specific preservation histories, the total amount of DNA extracted varied by collection. The Japanese collection yielded significantly more DNA than all other collections. In contrast, recovered microbial community compositions were largely the same across collections (populations), potentially indicating the oral microbiome to be largely conserved over time within humans regardless of diet, social practices, and location.

Results have been disseminated among Smithsonian Institution Anthropology curators, for national and international audiences through presentations in the fields of anthropology and biological sciences. The project provided data collection and museum experience opportunities, as well as professional development for graduate and undergraduate students through close mentorship with Smithsonian curators and public outreach opportunities at the National Museum of Natural History and the University of Oklahoma. This project has resulted in a completed dissertation and drafted scientific manuscript, as well as created an on-going conversation, in the form of workshops and consortiums, about human skeletal collection care, ethics, curation, policy, and research between project PIs and the Smithsonian Institution.

"The human body is colonized by trillions of microorganisms collectively known as the human microbiome. Research suggests that our microbiome may influence a wide range of physiological functions and health, from immune function to mood. However, there are still many unanswered questions about how these microbes interact with each other and how those interactions affect human biology. By studying large networks of microbial interactions and functions in industrialized and non-industrialized human communities, this doctoral dissertation research will examine the extent of ecological diversity in human gut microbiomes and how differences in lifestyle impact this diversity. The research team will provide hands-on workshops to participant communities to discuss how their participation helps to advance microbiome research. The project will also support student training and mentoring of individuals from unrepresented groups in STEM, supporting broader participation in a rapidly developing area of biological research.

Humans living a Western-industrialized lifestyle have markedly different microbiomes than those living a more traditional, non-industrial lifestyle, such as hunter-gatherers and rural farmers from developing countries. Earlier studies have determined that diet, antibiotic use, and contact between humans and other animals all have major impacts on microbiome diversity. In a number of these studies, the way in which microbial diversity was estimated did not necessarily account for the fact that microbiomes are complex ecologies. In this study, the researchers will investigate ecological dynamics and microbial interactions in microbiomes from humans and pigs on family farms in Oklahoma and compare them to humans and pigs from the African country of Burkina Faso. By comparing both humans and pigs in an industrialized country to a developing country, the researchers will document the effects of lifestyle on the human microbiome with a focus on human-animal interactions. By investigating the ecological dynamics of functional redundancy and resilience in gut microbiomes, the project will advance knowledge about complex microbial ecology.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Oklahoma Norman Campus,OK,30972,1925579,cmlewis@ou.edu,Cecil,Lewis,1,"At the time of this report, the DDIG contributed to two first-authored publications by the co-PI David Jacobson, in addition to the completion of his dissertation. In both publications, we contribute to the developing field of human microbial ecology in an effort to better understand these complex ecosystems. To date, much of microbiome research has lacked an ecological theory component and given the heavy focus on industrialized areas, microbiome studies have been like ""studying forest ecology by only examining city parks"". We demonstrate that this history has created major biases in how we understand the microbiome. These two publications focused on expanding applications of ecological theory to understudied human microbiome systems, including novel data from a contemporary population living a non-industrial lifestyle (Burkina Faso), as well as ancient Central American (Belize) and European (Sardinia) populations. Both publications involve in-depth ecological analysis of one of the more important aspects of the microbiome, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. SCFA are absolutely critical small molecules for maintaining a healthy gut. We study the microbiome in terms of ecological parameters, such as ""resilience"", the ability of the microbiome ecology to maintain itself when facing disturbances. Although studying ancient and non-industrial gut microbiomes presents unique challenges, such as limited reference databases, we discover that ancient and contemporary non-industrial gut microbiomes tend to be more resilient in their SCFA production than their industrial counterparts.
David Jacobson has one more first-authored publication accepted after peer review from his dissertation, and while this grant did not support this publication financially, the DDIG award permitted the above microbiome ecology manuscripts to be published in a timely fashion, freeing up time to complete this other publication.
Furthermore, the award has also supported two additional works that are forthcoming:
One, the training and data analyses used to provide summary microbiome data for the above SCFA paper also provided contextual data to a study of the human core metabolome. At the time of this report, the manuscript for this metabolome study is under peer-review.
Two, as initially proposed, the grant supported a study of antibiotic resistance genes and taxa. All data are collected for this manuscript and analyses are ongoing. One clear finding is that we estimate greater diversity in antibiotic resistance associate genes within the microbiome of more traditional populations than we do industrial population. This counter-intuitive finding may have an ecological explanation, which we are currently assessing.
The DDIG also provided the opportunity for David Jacobson to train an undergraduate student from the University of Oklahoma in molecular anthropology. The undergraduate student was trained in all aspects of state-of-the-art microbiome research, including DNA and RNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), generating high quality DNA sequencing data from a Illumina MiSeq machine, and bioinformatic data analysis. DDIG funds were then used to support the undergraduate student lead her own project on the human microbiome, which she presented at the University of Oklahoma’s Undergraduate Research Symposium.

"This doctoral dissertation project will use comparative and biocultural approaches to better understand how body phenotypes are understood in the US cultural context, and how these cultural understandings may contribute to biological disparities among adolescents. The investigators will measure allostatic load (a measure of low-level chronic stress) in two groups of adolescents to assess biological impacts of psychosocial stress from perceived weight stigma in various epidemiological contexts. The work will address complex relationships among phenotypic norms, social stigma, and co-morbidities of obesity in a vulnerable section of the US population, at a time when there is a high prevalence of obesity, perceived weight stigma, and weight discrimination. Research findings will be shared with study participants as well as curriculum specialists to develop new learning modules. The project supports graduate training for a female, first-generation college student. 

This research employs a mixed-methods, sequential explanatory strategy, using questionnaires, biomarkers, and ethnographic interviews to compare two populations varying in prevalence of obesity: Lawrence County, Indiana (38%) and Monroe County, Indiana (22%). The project is framed around the concept of biological normalcy, which refers to the ways in which human societies develop understandings of what a ""normal"" human body is - normal referring to normative ideas about what bodies ""should"" be as well as statistical distributions of different phenotypic traits. The researchers use this concept to address: 1) how cultural beliefs about what constitutes a ""normal"" or healthy body are related to statistical biological norms (i.e. obesity prevalence) within a population, and 2) how these normative beliefs influence the statistical distribution of biological traits (i.e. allostatic load) in a population. It is hypothesized that variation in obesity prevalence observed between the two field sites in Indiana will be associated with differences in perceived weight stigma, with those reporting higher perceived stigma also having higher allostatic load, and that this relationship will be moderated by several social and behavioral factors and coping strategies.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Indiana University,IN,12285,1847971,wileya@indiana.edu,Andrea,Wiley,1,"The primary goal of this project was to use comparative and biocultural approaches to better understand how body fat/weight is understood in the US cultural context, and how these cultural understandings might contribute to biological variability among adolescents and young adults. The project was framed around the concept of Biological Normalcy, which refers to the ways in which human societies develop understandings of what a ""normal"" human body is - normal referring to normative ideas about what bodies ""should"" be as well as statistical distributions of different phenotypic traits. More specifically, this research addressed how cultural beliefs about what constitutes a ""normal"" or healthy body weight are related to statistical biological norms within a population (i.e. obesity prevalence), and how these normative beliefs can influence the statistical distribution of biological health outcomes in a population.

This project encompassed two phases and employed a mixed-methods, sequential explanatory strategy, using questionnaires, biomarkers, and ethnographic interviews. The first phase assessed the relationships between perceptions of average body weight, healthy body weight, and weight status among 137 adolescents (March 2019 &ndash; October 2019). Eleven of these participants also participated in semi-structured interviews where they provided descriptions of what they thought were ""average,"" ""healthy,"" and ""normal"" body weights. Qualitative and quantitative data both indicated that perceived body weight norms were associated with normative perceptions around what healthy bodies look like, but this relationship was complicated by perceived weight status. Additionally, perceived weight status appears to play a role in adolescents’ conceptualizations of healthy body weight.

In the second phase, it was hypothesized that variation in obesity prevalence observed in different regions of the state of Indiana would be associated with differences in perceived weight stigma, with those reporting higher perceived stigma also having higher allostatic load (a measure of low-level chronic stress), and that this relationship would be moderated by several social and behavioral factors and coping strategies. To test these hypotheses, perceived weight stigma and allostatic load (measured using blood pressure, pulse rate, c-reactive protein, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HbA1c, and triglycerides) were evaluated in 175 late adolescents/young adults (aged 18-22) from different regions of the state of Indiana varying by adult obesity prevalence to assess biological impacts of psychosocial stress from perceived weight stigma in variable epidemiological contexts (March 2019 &ndash; March 2020). Semi-structured interviews were conducted virtually with 53 of these participants in June 2020. Other measures included height, weight, body fat percentage, emotional support, and use of different coping strategies.

Preliminary data analysis indicates that obesity prevalence did not predict perceived weight stigma. That said, higher perceived fat stigma was associated with higher allostatic load, even after controlling for body composition, and this relationship was significantly moderated by obesity prevalence, wherein the most vulnerable individuals appeared to be those experiencing high levels of weight-based stigma in populations where obesity is relatively less common. Further quantitative and qualitative data analyses still need to be conducted to see if differences in emotional support or coping strategies might contribute to the observed variation in the relationship between perceived weight stigma and allostatic load across different levels of obesity prevalence in this sample.

Results from the first phase have been submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and are currently under review. The co-PI presented the preliminary results from the second phase at the 46th Annual Meeting of the Human Biology Association on March 29, 2021 as well as in the official podcast of the Human Biology Association (The Sausage of Science, episode 120). Additional products from this project beyond these preliminary results will be distributed in presentations and publications in scientific journals in the future.

This work assessed complex relationships among phenotypic norms, social stigma, and co-morbidities of obesity in a vulnerable section of the US population, at a time when there is a high prevalence of obesity, perceived weight stigma, and weight discrimination. Furthermore, this research is the first to demonstrate a significant association between perceived weight stigma and allostatic load among late adolescents/early young adults. Research findings will be shared with study participants as well as curriculum specialists to develop new learning modules in the future. This project supported graduate training for a female, first-generation college student, and the co-PI mentored several female STEM undergraduate students from Indiana University who assisted during data collection and data entry. These students received training in bioethics, anthropometrics, blood sampling, data entry, and interview transcription.

"Scalp hair in the absence of body hair is a uniquely human trait, whose evolutionary significance is not well understood. This doctoral dissertation project will develop a digital tool for the quantitative measurement of hair fiber morphology, to investigate the underlying genetic architecture of hair morphology across human groups, and experimentally test the function of scalp hair as a barrier to solar heat gain. The methods developed as part of this project will advance our understanding of human adaptive traits and also inform forensic and dermatological research. Data collected for this project will increase the representation of understudied groups in research. This project will provide valuable research opportunities for undergraduates from groups underrepresented in STEM research fields and will generate materials for teaching about human biological diversity in a non-racial paradigm.

Human hair morphology varies on a continuous spectrum from straight to tightly curled; however, research in genetics, dermatology, and forensics incudes a range of descriptors that can be qualitative (e.g. wavy, frizzy) and racial (e.g. 'Caucasian hair,' 'African-type hair'). By developing a method to quantify hair morphology and studying the genetic variation in a diverse group of African Americans, this study leverages genetic admixture as a means of elucidating genotypes underlying hair morphology across human groups. The experimental work in this project will test the hypothesis that human scalp hair morphology evolved in early Homo as a protective mechanism against heat gain from solar radiation. This project will additionally carry out a series of tests of selection on candidate loci (previously associated with hair morphology or hair follicle development) to test whether there is evidence of selection in hair-related genes that would support a thermoregulatory explanation for the evolution of human scalp hair.

The project aimed to improve our understanding of how and why human’s evolved scalp hair that is variable in morphology. This work involved the development of new quantitative methods for phenotyping hair, analyses of genetic variation associated with hair morphology, and experimental work on heat transfer in relation to scalp hair. 
Lasisi successfully developed and released a Python package that allows for the automated analysis of both cross-sectional and longitudinal hair fiber images. Additionally, she has develop laboratory protocols for the preparations of cross-sectional and longitudinal (curvature) hair samples. Both the protocols and image analysis package are freely available and can be found through the project website (here) as well as the open-access publication on the methods (here). 
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, participant recruitment for the genetic research component could not be carried out as planned. However, Lasisi is using her newly developed hair phenotyping methods to analyze previously collected hair samples and plans to push this research forward as sampling becomes feasible again. Preliminary results on the potential for discovering new hair-related genetic loci are presented in the methods paper (here). 
Lastly, Lasisi carried out a novel experimental study on the effect of scalp hair morphology on heat transfer. Her results demonstrated that the presence of scalp hair significantly reduces heat gained from solar radiation and that tightly curled hair, in particular, minimizes heat gain from solar radiation. 
Results discussed in this report can be found in Lasisi’s doctoral dissertation which is freely available (here).  
 
The research funded by this grant has allowed Lasisi to produce novel research on an aspect of human biological variation that has historically been racialized and that remains poorly understood. This work has formed the basis of many of Lasisi’s science communication efforts and she continues to share her research and knowledge of human evolutionary biology through various public and social media outlets.

"Language is a trait that sets humans apart from all other species, and researchers are interested in understanding how, when, and why complex language evolved in hominins. This doctoral dissertation project will use a non-human model to understand neuro-genetic changes that correlate with increased social learning and flexibility of vocal behavior. These data will be compared with human and chimpanzee genomic data to identify potential shared evolutionary mechanisms in the evolution of birdsong and human language. By illuminating the molecular mechanisms of auditory perception that support learning of a more flexible vocal behavior in the model system, the research may shed light on our understanding of normal functionality and disorders of human speech. The project will also include public and K-12 science outreach activities in the San Francisco Bay Area.

This project will empirically investigate the genetic and evolutionary processes that correlate with increased flexibility of vocal learning and behavior in the White-Backed Munia (WBM)/Bengalese Finch (BF) songbird system. The researchers will then investigate potentially analogous genetic and functional pathways involved in the evolution of flexible human vocal learning capacities with respect to those of other primates. Specific aims of the project include: (i) an investigation of the evolutionary forces underlying the changes in vocal behavior in BF relative to WBM utilizing whole-genome sequencing of individuals within the two bird strains and subsequent scans for signatures of positive or relaxed selection, thus allowing identification of candidate genes modified in this transition; (ii) an analysis of genetically regulated differences in neurological function correlated with differences in the flexibility of adult vocal production between BF and WBM, by comparing measures of gene expression for whole transcriptomes from main birdsong-related brain areas of BF and WBM adult males exposed to unfamiliar conspecific song; and (iii) a comparison of the birdsong data to neuroanatomical and genomic data provided by studies of human divergence from closely related primates (e.g. chimpanzee) to identify possible evolutionary parallelisms.",NSF,University of California-Los Angeles,CA,28104,1913821,sawhite@ucla.edu,Stephanie,White,0,"Language is a shared symbolic system, and as such, no species other than humans has evolved it. However, many necessary components of spoken language are shared with communicative behaviors found in other species. Among these enabling blocks, there is the ability to learn to produce vocal sounds via imitation, in addition to associating innate sounds with external events or objects. Though quite rare and rudimentary among mammals, vocal production learning is a prominent trait in songbirds. Our research integrates tools from population genomics and brain transcriptomics to identify genes and biological pathways of importance for functional aspects of vocal production learning in the Bengalese finch, a domesticated songbird, frequently found in pet shops, but also a popular animal model in the study of learned vocal behaviors. Among songbird model species, the Bengalese finch draws special attention due to its less predictable ordering of vocal units composing a song, and its ability to learn from multiple tutors presented simultaneously. This vocal complexity evolved during the Bengalese finch?s domestication from white-backed munias, and it is greater than shown by other popular songbird model species, such as zebra finches. We have found several genomic areas with high differentiation between Bengalese finches and their munia ancestors, including multiple components of the dopamine system, a biopathway fundamental to vocal learning. Bengalese finches also show reduced genome-wide levels of variability, and evidence for the purging of changes potentially highly deleterious in captivity. We are simultaneously determining transcriptomic signatures in song-dedicated brain regions of juvenile, which are actively engaged in song learning, and adult male BFs, which have passed this learning phase and are instead engaged in song maintenance and performance. Currently, the BF/WBM system is the best characterized case of a within-lineage transition to a more complex pattern of production vocal learning, and both ancestor and descendant lineages are amenable for controlled experimental scientific investigation. Results from this work have the potential to guide further comparative efforts toward identifying analogous genes and biological pathways in our own species.

"Vitamin D is vital to the function of several organs and tissues, with decreased vitamin D levels hypothesized to be a contributing factor in several disease processes. Populations in higher latitudes are more likely to have vitamin D deficiencies due to lack of sun exposure; however, recent research indicates that vitamin D deficiency has become a global phenomenon, even in countries near the equator, with women often experiencing more severe deficiency. This doctoral dissertation project applies a biocultural perspective on vitamin D production from infancy through young adulthood to investigate how societal practices and norms create and dictate the physical environments that individuals experience. By using a longitudinal data set, the study delves deeper into the possible factors that contribute to vitamin D deficiency in both men and women, and for societies undergoing urbanization. The project not only addresses the complex interplay of human biology and culture, but also has the potential to inform public health efforts to understand and address vitamin D deficiency.  

Biological anthropology has elaborated the tradeoffs between the need for vitamin D production and the need to avoid damage from the harmful effects of exposure to ultraviolet rays, but unanswered questions remain regarding how vitamin D is regulated and why some individuals are at risk for vitamin D deficiency.  The primary focus has been on sun exposure, but other aspects of the current environment, and aspects of the environment experienced early in life, may be equally important.  This study will use longitudinal data collected from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey in the Philippines to assess the effects of rapid urbanization and socioeconomic change on vitamin D production in young adulthood.  A range of environmental factors early in development, and in adulthood, will be tested as predictors of circulating vitamin D.  Furthermore, DNA methylation - an epigenetic process that is associated with gene expression - will be measured at sites in genes associated with vitamin D production.  DNA methylation is a plausible mechanism through which environments during development can regulate genome activity in adulthood, and the study will investigate the association between environments in childhood, DNA methylation of vitamin D genes, and vitamin D production in adulthood. The use of a biocultural anthropological approach allows for an exploration of how lived experience affects vitamin D production and well-being over the life course.

Populations in higher latitudes are more likely to have vitamin D deficiencies due to lack of sun exposure; however, recent research indicates that vitamin D deficiency has become a global phenomenon, even in countries near the equator with women often experiencing more severe deficiency.  Therefore, it is critical to understand what contexts and behaviors, in adulthood and during development, influence levels of vitamin D production. This project applies a anthropological perspective on vitamin D production from infancy through young adulthood to illustrate how societal practices and norms create and dictate the physical environments that individuals experience. By using a longitudinal data set, the study delves deeper into the possible factors that contribute to vitamin D deficiency during the life couse for both men and women in societies undergoing urbanization, which is vital to understanding the long-term health consequences of vitamin D regulation.  

This study uses longitudinal data collected from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey in the Philippines to assess the effects of rapid urbanization and socio-economic change on vitamin D production in young adulthood.  A range of environmental factors early in development, and in adulthood, were tested as predictors of circulating vitamin D.  Furthermore, DNA methylation&mdash;an epigenetic process that is associated with gene expression&mdash;was measured at sites in genes associated with vitamin D production.  DNA methylation is a plausible mechanism through which environments during development can regulate genome activity in adulthood, and the study will investigate the association between environments in childhood, DNA methylation of vitamin D genes, and vitamin D production in adulthood. 

Overall, vitamin D in this population differed between females and males, with males more likely to have higher 25(OH) vitamin D measurements than females. Additionally, females were more likely to be categorized as deficient (&lt; 20ng.mL) or insufficient (&lt; 30 ng/mL) with regards to their vitamin D status as compared to males, and almost 75% of the sample was not able to meet their vitamin D requirements. Furthermore, females were more likely to have greater adiposity and less physical activity than their male counterparts. Here, research indicates that the measure of adiposity requires the more nuanced and rigorous measurement of collecting skinfold thickness. Researchers emphasized the need to control for adiposity by using BMI. However, the research results on body composition and vitamin D indicate that BMI is not the best control for adiposity in this population. Skinfold thickness is a much better measure of adiposity.

For adulthood environment, no major differences were found between the female and male groups. The only significant predictor for males in adulthood was fish consumption, and no significant factors were found for females. However, fish consumption may have a gendered compoenent that indicates why male fish consumption positively predicts vitamin D. Fishing is traditionally a male occupation, which may indicate that female exclusion is also impacting vitamin D levels. Furthermore, methylation was not found to signficantly predict vitamin D production indicating that vitamin D production may be more sensitive to environments in adulthood. 

Broader impacts include the generation of knowledge that may improve public health.  Because many communicable and non-communicable diseases are associated with vitamin D deficiency, understanding the developmental and ecological determinants of circulating serum vitamin D is vital to understanding the links between vitamin D deficiency and disease.  In addition, the project contributed to diversifying the infrastructure of science by supporting a PhD project led by a student from a group historically under-represented in science.

"This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the relationship between physiology and behavior when humans are exposed to novel, challenging environments. The project will draw upon core bodies of research on biological plasticity and adaptation, energy allocation and expenditure, and social cooperation. This research will facilitate new insights on how humans acclimate to extreme cold and high altitude demands, which will broadly inform research on human capacities to respond to the diverse range of ecological stressors found throughout the world. This study will help train a woman of color at the University of Notre Dame for her PhD and will also help in the training of undergraduate and junior graduate students in the Hormones, Health, & Human Behavior Lab, of which ~80% of lab members are women and underrepresented minority students. In conjunction with the National Outdoor Leadership School, the investigator has created a project website that both students and the public can easily access for preliminary findings and updates on the study. The research team has also heavily engaged in public outreach, including presentations for elementary and middle school classes, public lectures to local communities, and promoting scientific inquiry and sharing research through popular science articles, podcasts, and social media venues like Twitter.

This project aims to help understand how humans biologically and behaviorally acclimate to novel and challenging ecologies, specifically via the relationships between energetic/metabolic physiology, neuroendocrine systems, and social dynamics. The investigator will study individuals participating in ~90 day expeditions through the American Rockies as a part of the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). In such environments (e.g. high altitude or cold), ecological and psychological stressors impose intensive demands on human physiology, including metabolic and psychobiological functioning. The research will address larger discussions about (i) biological variation, plasticity, and adaptation in challenging ecologies, (ii) life history- and ecological-based perspectives on energetic allocation and expenditure, and (iii) the evolution and function of prosociality, cooperation, and collective action. Recognizing the relationship and nuances between physiology and behavior may give critical insight into the success of human global expansion and settlement, with implications for human health and well-being as well as future exploration, and habitation of increasingly changing and unique ecologies.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Notre Dame,IN,20788,1847850,lgettler@nd.edu,Lee,Gettler,1,"This project, Acclimating to the Extreme: Energy Expenditure, Neuroendocrine Systems, &amp; Social Dynamics in Novel/Challenging Environments, evaluated how individuals' biology and behavior acclimatized to an energetically-demanding environment over 3-month long expeditions through the American Rockies as a part of the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). Specifically, this project assessed how body composition, hormones, and energetic physiology (n = 71) changed over the 3-month period as well as the relationship between changes in hormones and how people spent energy. Additionally, this project assessed how processes related to social dynamics, such as perceptions of stress and resilience, related to individual physiology, particularly hormone and energetic systems. The findings from this work provided critical insights into how individuals successfully cope with the high-energy demands of new and difficult environments.

The intellectual merit of this project is that it addresses how processes related to social and interpersonal dynamics influence individual hormonal and energetic physiology under challenging ecological conditions. These are theoretically important processes that are relevant to contemporary human experience, including everyday functioning in an extreme environment, and that are potentially relevant to periodic demands placed on past human populations. In addition, this project brings innovative and integrative perspectives measuring different and interrelated physiological and behavioral systems repeatedly over time, which can inform our understanding of the timescale over which these complex changes occur as humans accommodate the pertinent environmental and social stressors. Our findings from this research demonstrate that body weight and lean muscle declined when individuals first began the expedition but were able to rebound by the end of the three-month period. We also found that in a highly demanding yet tightly controlled setting like the NOLS course, individual perceptions of lower stress and greater resilience during the expeditions predicted lower cortisol production, which may have had downstream impacts on health and performance. Further, we found that greater resilience predicted greater energy expenditure, on average, suggesting that resilient individuals worked harder and spent more energy. These findings have important implications for positive-perception building in small teams engaged in challenging environments. 

This project has translatable, applied implications that can influence small groups engaging in similarly challenging environments, such as soldiers, aid-workers, and even astronauts, by anticipating changes to the body during acclimatization and identifying what factors are most important in buffering the physiological stress response. The broader impacts of this work also include contributing to the infrastructure of science and education through training of a graduate student, co-PI (Sarma), who is a woman of color, as well as the training and mentorship of three undergraduate women, who were each the lead authors of scientific abstracts at a professional academic conference. Further, this work contributes to public science outreach, advancing education and informing issues of broader societal importance. Every participant was given an outline of preliminary findings specific to them upon completion of the course and the research team is working on developing a project website to relay relevant information back to stakeholders. Throughout this project, Sarma has been invited to give nine talks about her research, ranging from public lectures about this project and related science with local communities to K-12 science outreach. Additionally, Sarma has been a guest on three podcasts to speak about this project and has been cited as an expert in local and international news outlets. This kind of outreach and science communication has advanced the public's understanding about how humans accommodate to extreme environments through changes to their body and behavior.

From this project, we have created a database assessing within-individual change across multiple dimensions over the length of a 3-month long expedition with data derived from saliva samples, activity monitoring, heart-rate monitoring, and surveys; the de-identified data collected will be eventually placed in a publicly accessible repository. We plan to publish the findings from this project in peer-reviewed publications and have three papers in progress. We aim to continue to share the project outcomes and implications with the public.

"Humans have lightly built skeletons compared to both non-human primates and extinct human ancestors. Most research on human skeletal variation has focused on comparing bone structure among geographically, genetically, and behaviorally diverse human groups. In order to understand the influence of behavior and mobility on human bone structure, this doctoral dissertation project will quantify skeletal variation among human groups that are genetically and geographically similar, but behaviorally distinct. This research integrates archaeological evidence of human behavior and microcomputed tomography data to investigate bone structure as an intersection between behavior and biology. Low bone mass related health complications are a prominent expense within the U.S. healthcare system; this project will provide insights into the factors that may contribute to the risk of low bone mass related health issues from an anthropological perspective. The project will also contribute to the development educator workshops for using publicly available 3D image data for classroom-based research projects. 

Recent work has found that human groups with higher levels of activity tend to have more robust cortical and trabecular bone structure compared to groups with relatively lower activity levels. However, much of this research has relied on comparing geographically and genetically distinct human groups. This project investigates the relationship between cortical and trabecular bone structural variation across several post-cranial elements within and between human groups that are genetically and geographically similar, but behaviorally distinct in order to test whether the relationship between behavior and bone structure is maintained, or if other factors such as diet, genetic background, and environment play a larger role in forming adult skeletal phenotype than previously considered. Microcomputed tomography scan data of the humerus, cervical vertebra, femur, tibia, talus, and calcaneus will be collected. Cortical and trabecular bone structural variation will be quantified and compared between groups with different subsistence strategies including foragers, horticulturalists, and intensive agriculturalists. Additionally, the amount of variation in cortical and trabecular bone will be investigated within and between both individuals and skeletal elements in order to understand how different levels of bone structural organization respond to variation in subsistence strategy and mechanical loading.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,28556,1847806,tmr21@psu.edu,Timothy,Ryan,1,"Present-day modern humans have relatively lightly built skeletons compared to extinct members of our lineage and non-human primates. Previous research has suggested that reduced skeletal robusticity in modern humans coincides with the adoption of agriculture, and the reduction in mobility and activity that was likely associated. Most research has focused on comparing bone structure among geographically, genetically, and behaviorally distinct human groups within the context of changes in food acquisition strategies and activity patterns. However, this approach does not consider other factors known to influence bone structure, including genetics and environmental context. The goal of this project was to complement previous research by investigating how behavior (activity + mobility + diet) influences variation in bone structure between human groups, which, based on archaeological evidence were environmentally and genetically similar, but behaviorally distinct. High-resolution microcomputed tomography image data and advanced bone analysis methods were used to quantify and compare bone structure variation between groups. In general, results indicate that the human group interpreted as being the most physically active (hunter-gatherers) also had the most robust bone structure and the group interpreted as being relatively less active (agriculturalists) had less robust bone structure. The group with intermediate activity level also had intermediate bone robusticity. These findings are consistent with Bone Functional Adaptation, where increased biomechanical loading on bone elicits a biological response that results in more bone material being laid down. Integrating archaeological evidence of human behavior, microCT imaging and visualization, and quantification of bone structure to investigate the relationship between activity and human skeletal structure allows for better control of factors besides activity that are known to influence bone structure, such as environment and genetic ancestry, relative to previous studies. The results provide insight into the effects of variation in subsistence strategy, mobility, and physical activity on human skeletal structure and help strengthen interpretations of living and fossil human behavior in the past.

Beyond investigating variation in human bone structure, another important aspect of this project was to engage with K-12 educators and provide the knowledge and resources necessary to offer their students classroom research experiences. Two five-day educator workshops were developed in collaboration with the Penn State Center for Science and the Schools and the Penn State Functional and Evolutionary Morphology Research Lab and took place in July 2019 and July 2021. During the workshops, participants gained experience and perspective on how to use evidence to interpret and draw conclusions based on morphological data by exploring evolutionary and functional morphology of primates, considering biomechanical explanations for why skeletal traits differ within and between species, collecting and analyzing morphological data using 3D models of bones, learning to use online scientific software, and developing skills to visualize and interpret data using online resources. At the end of the week, educators presented outlines for research projects they would conduct with their students in the coming school years.

"Humans vary in body size and proportions, and the underlying drivers of this variation are not fully understood. Differences in body form can be adaptive for certain environments, such as assisting in thermoregulation of the body through the dissipation or retention of heat, but can also be related to factors such as genetic drift and population history.  This doctoral dissertation research will examine human skeletal variation to understand the impact of various environmental factors on human body form across a wide geographical range.  The project will help to elucidate how environmental factors may have complex, differential effects in males versus females and across different parts of the skeleton. Skeletal data from the project will be compiled into a freely accessible online database. The addition of data for groups and regions of the world that are currently underrepresented in biological and forensic studies will increase understanding of human variation and global diversity.  The project will also foster international research collaborations and student training at the undergraduate and graduate levels. 

Asia has diverse climates, high population densities, and a long history of human habitation.  Using a multidisciplinary methodological approach, this study of Asian populations will meaningfully quantify proportional differences resulting from environmental variables in a way not possible with previous ecogeographic methods.  Standard skeletal measurements and landmarks will be collected to allow for comparisons across geographic regions as well as further examination of variation in the size and shape of the face, cranial vault, and birth canal between the sexes and populations. The analyses will account for the potential influence of nonadaptive forces such as drift and migration on body form by pairing skeletal measurements with appropriately matched genetic data and local weather station information for statistical analysis.  Linear mixed effects models testing for evidence of adaptation due to environmental factors will contain both head and body data of male and female individuals from each population.  Differences in the size and shape of the pelvis between the sexes along with population differences in pelvic morphology will be evaluated using Procrustes fit and principal components analyses as well as size and shape dimorphism indices.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Missouri-Columbia,MO,23814,1847486,cowgilll@missouri.edu,Libby,Cowgill,1,"Funding of this project by NSF allowed for Elizabeth Cho to travel to seven countries in Asia to amass a sample size of 957 individuals originating from 11 different populations for her dissertation research.  At each research location, skeletal measurements were taken on bones of the limbs, hands, and feet and three-dimensional landmark data gathered on the skull and articulated pelvis.  Osteological data was then combined with appropriately matched climate and autosomal genetic data for analysis to discern trends in human adaptation to climate in Asia while considering the potential influences of shared population history and sexual dimorphism.

Postcranial measurements were found to be more influenced by minimum temperature than those of the skull.  However, this association was not found in the hands or feet which suggests that cultural buffering or functional constraints on covarying traits may be muting any adaptive pressure placed on these most distal body parts.  While the sexes often exhibited the same pattern of association with climate, they did not always respond with the same intensity.  These findings support differences in environmental sensitivity between the sexes.  Overall, East Asians increased in overall size and body mass with decreased temperature and decreased in overall size and body mass with increased temperature.  Population dimorphism analyses support a correlation between body mass and temperature, as expected based on Bergmann’s rule.  Despite identifying shared trends of the most and least dimorphic traits of the cranium and pelvis across populations, the level of dimorphism within populations did not exhibit gradual variation in a single direction when associated with climate.

Intellectual merit: The results of this project have been disseminated at national anthropology conferences (earning a student prize for most outstanding presentation on bones), via a podcast episode to a general audience, as part of a university research seminar series, and at the successful defense of the Co-PI’s dissertation.  The inclusion of shape and measurement data throughout the body allowed for the holistic assessment of adaptive trends within the same individual, something that has been lacking in a number of past ecogeographic studies solely centered on the skull or postcrania.  This work also improves understanding of global diversity through representation of a geographic region that has been largely absent in studies of human variation, adaptation, and evolution.

Broader impacts: This research has created the largest East Asian dataset of cranial and postcranial skeletal measurements and shape data to date.  Each population has male and female samples of roughly similar size, which not only better represents skeletal variation of each population within the geographical region but provides a much-needed increase in female representation for morphological and ecogeographic studies.  During data collection, students and professionals at several Asian universities were taught how to gather and analyze three-dimensional landmark data so that they can utilize this approach in their own future research.  International travel and the presentation of project findings has assisted in the building of future research collaborations (domestically and internationally), professional development of the Co-PI, and led to an early career opportunity testing thermoregulatory principles in an effort to link anatomical variation and physiology to the skeletal structure of living individuals.

"Old World monkeys are the most geographically widespread and ecologically diverse group of living primates, with a wide range of diets made possible by the combination of their gut adaptations and the unique shape of their molar teeth. Old World monkeys acquired ""bilophodont"" molars, with cusps united into two pairs of wedges, soon after diverging from a last common ancestor with apes. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the functional significance of this shift in molar form, drawing upon, and contributing to, a framework that considers how dental wear alters the shape and function of teeth throughout an organism's life. This project will also provide opportunities for public outreach and undergraduate research engagement, including students traditionally underrepresented in STEM careers. The large number of 3D scans generated by this project will be made publicly available through MorphoSource, where they can have further use for scientific and educational purposes.  

Primates, like all herbivorous mammals, face selective pressures to maintain function of their permanent teeth in the face of tooth wear. This project will use 3D dental topographic methods to measure the shearing and crushing/grinding potential of molars at varying wear stages in a sample of extant and fossil catarrhines (i.e., Old World monkeys, apes, and humans). First, the investigators will establish a baseline of how extant catarrhine molars are altered by macroscopic wear and use phylogenetic comparative methods to test whether diet or tooth morphology has a greater influence on maintenance of shearing function. Second, these methods will be applied to measure the shearing and crushing/grinding potential from molars of Oligocene and Miocene catarrhines. While extant Old World monkeys have two fully developed lophs on their molars, early members of this clade exhibit partial loph development in some molars. The investigators will test whether these early stages of bilophodonty gave stem cercopithecoids greater persistence of certain tooth functions relative to their non-cercopithecoid catarrhine relatives. Ultimately, this project will contribute to our understanding of the functional origins underlying a key adaptation that contributes to the dietary flexibility and evolutionary success of Old World monkeys.

As of June 2020, 907 casts of lower molar rows have been scanned using an Identica Hybrid structured blue-light scanner to create 65&mu;m resolution 3D surface models of these teeth. These models are will be made available to researchers and educations via the online 3D data repository Morphosource following completion of the doctoral dissertation.

The process of creating these 3D surface models of extant catarrhine molars facilitated the training of three undergraduate students, all of whom come from backgrounds underrepresented in STEM fields. These students were given experience in the process of structured blue light scanning, mesh processing, 3D data collection, microCT scan segmentation, and dental topographic methods. This diverse array of skill sets is applicable to a wide range of fields, from biology to geography to design, and will help prepare these students for their chosen career paths.

The aim of this doctoral dissertation project is to understand functional changes associated with the evolution of the unique bilophodont shape of Old World monkey molars. To achieve this aim, this project must first build a framework for understanding how tooth wear changes the function of molars in extant catarrhines with distinct dietary behaviors. Maintenance of shearing surfaces with progressive tooth wear has been proposed to be an adaptation among folivorous and gramnivorous primates, but a link between dietary toughness and shearing maintenance has not yet been established in catarrhines. As data processing is ongoing, only preliminary analyses have been conducted. However, these initial results suggest that there are differences in the degree to which molar shearing function is altered with tooth wear in extant Old World monkeys, but these differences are not patterned along dietary categories. Maintenance of shearing function occurs in at least one primarily frugivorous species. These results suggest the relationship between shearing maintenance and diet may not be straightforward in Old World monkeys, potentially limiting the ability to draw inferences about fossil Old World monkey diets based on these methods.

"Modern humans have dispersed and settled nearly every region on the planet. The complex timing, movements, and interactions of populations, cultures, and technology in the past are an important part of our human story. This doctoral dissertation project combines genetic and geochemical analyses of human skeletal material from the Chelechol ra Orrak site in Palau, western Micronesia, to investigate prehistoric colonization of an island setting during one of the most widespread and rapid dispersals in human history. Despite this being the last major geographical region to be colonized by humans, information regarding the timing, direction, and origins of settlement in many respects remains unclear. This research will also make broader contributions to local, national, and global communities through undergraduate training and mentorship at the University of Oregon; community involvement and outreach through public talks and the distribution of comics about aDNA in archaeology in Palau; and the implementation of a learning module that teaches the scientific method, archaeological fieldwork, and genetic techniques to underrepresented elementary and middle school students in Oregon.

The investigators will analyze human ancient DNA (aDNA) and geochemical mobility data for Micronesia and provide critical baseline information for future isotopic and genetic research in the region. The objective of this research is to investigate the origins of prehistoric Palauans on a regional scale and subsequent local human mobility within the archipelago following settlement. While linguistic, computer modeling, and biodistance studies have resulted in hypotheses identifying broad general regions of Micronesian population origins, numerous questions regarding the relationship of early Micronesians to other regional populations, and a more specific area of origin still remain. In generating aDNA data for western Micronesia, this project will place early Palauans in a regional framework to examine broader scale genetic relationships. Examination of mobility via strontium (87Sr/ 86Sr) and lead (206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb) isotope analysis from human remains--in conjunction with biological and geological samples taken from locations across the archipelago--will help to identify where individuals buried at Chelechol ra Orrak may have been residing during their lifetime and shed light on inter-island mobility during the earliest phases of settlement in Palau.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Oregon Eugene,OR,24822,1848513,smfitzpa@uoregon.edu,Scott,Fitzpatrick,1,"Initial human settlement of Remote Oceania represents one of the most rapid and widespread population dispersals in human history. Despite being the most recent major geographical region to be settled by humans, many questions remain regarding the timing of arrival and the origins of Remote Oceania's first inhabitants. This is particularly true in Micronesia, an area of the northwest tropical Pacific, where the coarse nature of available data has prevented researchers from identifying points of origin for early settlers. However, the Chelechol ra Orrak cemetery site, located in Palau, western Micronesia, contains one of the region's largest and oldest human skeletal assemblages and has great potential to fill a number of gaps in our existing knowledge of the earliest Pacific people. In order to address these issues, this project used bioarchaeological methods to investigate 1) the origins of early Palauan people on a regional scale and, 2) local human mobility within the Palauan archipelago following initial settlement. 

To better understand the timing and distribution of early migrations to Palau, ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis of skeletal remains from Chelechol ra Orrak was used to test hypotheses related to potential population source regions based on existing archaeological and linguistic evidence. The addition of radiocarbon dates from the same individuals sampled for aDNA was used to account for possible changes in genetic ancestry over time. This was particularly important as Chelechol ra Orrak was utilized for mortuary practice for over 1000 years. To address the second objective related to mobility within the Palauan archipelago, an analysis of strontium and lead isotope ratios from tooth enamel was used to identify where individuals buried at Chelechol ra Orrak may have been residing during their lifetime, as there is no substantive evidence of settlement in this area of Palau during this time. 

Radiocarbon dates demonstrated that the sampled individuals from whom genetic data could be obtained date to between ~2700-1800 BP, with the majority of burials dating to between ~2750-2300 BP. Although aDNA results only reflect a small number of individuals (n=5), some broad conclusions can be made based on the partial and completed mitochondrial genomes produced as a part of this work. When placed in a regional perspective, these results are characteristic of populations originating in Island Southeast Asia, lending biological support to migration models based on previous linguistic and archaeological evidence. Support for genetic connections to New Guinea, which has been proposed as a possible homeland for early Palauans in past research, was noticeably absent. Additionally, there is no evidence for shared maternal ancestry between Palauan and other early Remote Oceanic groups, raising the possibility that two, or possibly three distinct population dispersals from Island Southeast Asia reached Remote Oceania ca. 3000 BP. 

Results from the isotopic analyses have begun to provide some information regarding mobility within the Palauan archipelago. Strontium isotope values were obtained from at least two different molars each for 11 individuals. Low heterogeneity was observed across samples, but three samples representing two individuals fall outside two standard deviations of the average strontium value, which may indicate the presence of some non-local people interred at Chelechol ra Orrak. Together with the aDNA data, these results also provide some insight into the use of Chelechol ra Orrak as a cemetery site. aDNA results suggest that four distinct maternal lineages are represented by the individuals sampled, demonstrating that Chelechol ra Orrak was utilized as a cemetery by multiple maternally unrelated families rather than a single family group. The additional possibility that non-local individuals may also be interred at the site lends further support to the suggestion that the site may have been used for a broader population. 

The project produced the first human ancient DNA (aDNA) and geochemical mobility data for both Palau and western Micronesia and provides critical baseline information to facilitate future comparisons as research utilizing aDNA and isotopic analyses as tools for exploring population relationships and mobility in the region continue to expand. Additionally, this project has made broader contributions to local, national, and global communities through training and mentorship of undergraduate students at the University of Oregon, community involvement in Palau, including the distribution of comics about aDNA and archaeology, and the implementation of a learning module that teaches the scientific method, archaeological fieldwork, and genetic techniques to elementary and middle school students from underrepresented communities in Oregon.

"Old Dominion University is awarded an Early Faculty Career Development grant to support Dr Shuiwang Ji in research leading to a better understanding of the brain. The brain is an enormously complex system, and the analysis of brain data is thus an equally enormous challenge. Human brains contain billions of neurons and trillions of synapses (junctions); and each of them is unique in their basic biochemistry, functions, and dynamics. The brain is also a multi-level system organized across different spatial scales, ranging from genes, synapses, and cells to circuits, brain regions, and systems. Today, brain science is experiencing rapid changes and is expected to achieve major advances in the near future. Recent technological innovations are enabling scientists to capture the gene expression patterns, connectivity, and neuronal activities at increasing speed and resolution. This is generating a deluge of data that capture the brain activities at different levels of organization. To attack the central challenges of analyzing these new data, this project will develop a class of efficient, integrative, multidimensional, predictive, and correlative techniques and use them to analyze large-scale, high-resolution, and multi-modality sets of brain data. Specifically, this project will develop analytics tools to predict the cellular-resolution, brain-wide connectome (""wiring diagram"") from genetic transcriptional profiles. This analysis will elucidate the information pathway from genes to connectivity and ultimately, to function. This project will also integrate other brain dimensions by performing multidimensional network correlative analytics. In addition, this project will address the relationship between gene expression, cell types, and brain structures. The success of this project will be a new class of efficient, robust analytics methods that are flexible enough to be adapted for integrating, modeling, and mining current and future brain data.

The results of this project will have an immediate and strong impact on multiple disciplines, including brain data analytics and computational neuroscience, biological image informatics, and big data analytics. A future long term goal is to uncover basic underlying differences between normal and impaired brain functions. The unified treatment of brain data analytics will be readily transformable into new courses for training next-generation computational biologists. The multidisciplinary nature of this project provides unique opportunities for integrating its components into existing curricula. Brain science has been shown to be a valuable resource for inspiring scientific interests in K-12 students. Components of the project will be integrated into an existing high-school student internship program, thereby inspiring future science students. Underrepresented students will be especially encouraged to participate throughout the project. The results of this project will be disseminated in the form of peer-reviewed publications, open-source software, tutorials, seminars, and workshops. All findings, publications, software, and data will be made publicly available at the project website: http://compbio.cs.odu.edu/CAREER/",NSF,Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station,TX,449380,1922969,sji@tamu.edu,Shuiwang,Ji,0,"The brain is an enormously complex system, and analysis of brain data is thus an equally enormous challenge.

Secondly, I integrated other brain dimensions by performing multidimensional network correlative analytics. This type of analysis is based on a new class of probability distributions defined on multidimensional data arrays. My third initiative addressed the relationship between gene expression, cell types, and brain structures. All of the novel analytics methods in this project is based on a common foundation of the sparsity learning paradigm, which was originally motivated by neuronal information processing mechanisms. Overall, I developed three novel and significant advances in the scientific field of computational brain data analytics. Each advance dramatically extended current analytics techniques towards understanding multi-level, complex brain systems. Altogether, I developed a unified approach to deciphering the brain structure and function and provide a systematic framework for developing the methodologies to implement them. Multiple high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students have been trained throughout this project.

"The science of forecasting where a species can live and how it responds to climate change is still in its infancy. A species' geographic range is the map of where a species can be found. It is fundamental to understanding species' ecology and evolution and increasingly plays a vital role in conservation. Collections of species ranges covering most of the 30,000 terrestrial vertebrate species are already available for scientific analysis. However, collections of species ranges from the other ~95% of species on the planet are rare. The time is ripe to change this. New access to vast quantities of data from biological inventories, museums, citizen science, and previously funded studies mean that adequate data are available to estimate the ranges of many more species. However, we are currently missing robust forecasting methods and the computational tools to produce large numbers of ranges. This project will develop the novel computational methods and algorithms needed to forecast the current state and future fate of the many thousands of poorly studied species ranges. These methods will be applied to forecast how 100,000+ plant species in the New World will respond to climate change. The researchers will test key assumptions in conservation biology about how species respond to changing climate and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots across North and South America have/will change over time.  The end result of their work will be a novel tool for the ecological community that has tremendous potential to guide biological sampling strategies, particularly in conservation and citizen science applications. 

The proposed research will examine whether biodiversity hotspots are constant through time and whether species climatic niches are phylogenetically conserved, two implicit assumptions with wide-reaching implications in conservation biology and basic ecology. This research will develop a workflow to predict species ranges for any taxonomic group using by combining occurrence data with GIS data. This workflow will be applied to all New World plants to study basic questions, such as how species richness varies across space and time (a topic studied almost exclusively in vertebrates and trees). Computationally, the project will address core challenges in data scrubbing, niche modeling practices, novel niche modeling methods, and mega-phylogeny analysis methods.  A freely available generic pipeline will be capable of linking biodiversity occurrence data to species ranges and scaling these computations to 1000s or 100,000s of species. This integrated pipeline will be implemented by: 1) appropriately scrubbing data to remove taxonomic and geographic errors, 2) identifying clear best practice methods for range modeling applicable across diverse species, 3) innovating range modeling methods that integrate diverse data such as presence only museum collections and abundance-based plot data 4) scaling computationally-intensive range modeling in an HPC environment, and 5) placing the outputs of the products in a phylogenetic context. This project will develop such a pipeline using a novel database of 20,000,000 observations of 100,000+ species of plants in the New World. The range forecasts produced will be used to test key assumptions in conservation biology about the phylogenetic conservatism of species climatic niches and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots over time. This research will make substantial contributions to scientific infrastructure through the development of a scientific codebase for the production of high-quality species ranges from primary biodiversity data.  The results of the project can be found via the following websites (http://bien.nceas.ucsb.edu/bien/ and bien3.org).",NSF,University of Connecticut,CT,62149,1913673,cory.merow@gmail.com,Cory,Merow,0,"This project is in the rapidly growing field of biodiversity informatics - the assemblages of large datasets that can inform scientists about biodiversity. 

The initial efforts in this project were to: 1) improve the largest database to date recording every scientific observation of a plant species available electronically. It eventually grew to have over 100,000,000 observations of plants with well over 100,000 species worldwide. 2) To use these observations to generate maps of species ranges, the areas where a species lives. A key focus in the first step was to scrub or clean the data. As you might imagine data collected by 1000s of scientists stored in hundreds of institutions is not particular standardized nor is it usually usually inspected for errors. But doing good science requires accurate information.  All of this data and the tools we developed are shared openly and freely with the scientific community to enhance their productivity in other biodiversity informatics endeavors (e.g. other groups of species). 

One key result from this work was discovering just how numerous rare species are. It has always been known that it was a rather common state to be rare (there are many more rare species than widely spread abundant species). But we were surprised just how many rare species there are among plants globally (almost 37% are extremely rare). There are more rare species than any existing theory predicted. We also mapped areas of the world known as hotspots that have a high number of rare species.  These areas become important targets for efforts to protect more land (e.g. by creating new national parks). In identifying these areas we also found that these areas are among some of the areas most impacted by humans and climate change, making their protection urgent.









Another important result was exploring the linkage between protected lands and the risk of extinction from future climate change. Although it is obvious that more protected lands is better for biodiversity and further that that should hold for reducing risk of extinction from climate change, quantitative relationships had not been produced for large areas before. Overall our assessment found that extinction risk drops most dramatically when increasing from about 15% protected lands to about 30%. Currently about 15% of land is protected, and many conservation treaties seek to protect up to 30%. This study validated that there are indeed major reductions in extinction risk in moving from where we are today to protecting about twice as much land. At the same time this study demonstrated the need for protecting more land, it also shows that there are major benefits to biodiversity even if a majority of the land remains devoted to human needs. Such win-win outcomes are desperately needed in conservation. 

In addition to informing conservation efforts and providing new tools to other scientists working in biodiversity informatics, this project provided training to about a dozen graduate students and postdocs in this newly emerging field at the interface of traditional ecology and data science. Most of these students plan to go into biodiversity informatics themselves, but some have transferred their data science skills into industry unrelated to biodiversity. Either way, training experts in data science helps to close the large gap between needed and available personnel in this rapidly growing field.

"Scientists have observed an epidemiologic paradox in which some populations have better physiological outcomes than others, despite having lower income and education that normally would predict higher morbidity and mortality. However, there are many complex factors that potentially confound such findings, such as within-group heterogeneity. This doctoral dissertation project will use and expand the theory of local biologies, the idea that human biology is shaped by an individual's context, to examine physiological well-being for genetically similar populations. The research will advance knowledge about the interface of human culture and biology, minimizing the potentially confounding effects of population heterogeneity. The project will support training for students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields, as well as public and community science outreach and public health information based on the project findings. 

This doctoral dissertation project explores how the physical and sociocultural environment shapes the development of physiologic disorders among Hispanic populations in North America. The project combines a rigorous examination of physiological well-being using biomarkers of cardiometabolic disorders and an ethnographic exploration of the sociocultural and physical surroundings of Purepecha individuals in different areas. The incorporation of standardized instruments to measure acculturation and other variables will permit comparison with similar studies. The research is significant in its focus on an understudied population within the broader Hispanic/Latinx context.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,NC,30724,1825734,althomps@email.unc.edu,Amanda,Thompson,1,"This award has contributed to the collection, analysis, and writing of the co-PI's dissertation. The intellectual contributions of this project center on advancing our understanding of chronic disease formation among Hispanic/Latinx origin populations now living in the United States. This work focused on a single group within the larger category within the larger group. Although there are similarities across the Hispanic/Latinx population, the differences are significant enough to influence health. This research limits its scope to the P'urepecha, an indigenous population originating in Michoacan, Mexico. In doing so, there is reduced variation in things ranging from diet composition to genetic variability as well as other factors capable of influencing health outcomes. Another important consideration addressed here has to do with the comparison group. Most studies to date do not include a direct comparison between foreign-born immigrants and their source population. This binational study focuses on P'urepecha in the U.S. as well as P'urepecha who have not migrated outside their origin communities.

In the U.S. typical acculturation scales attempt to measure the degree to which newcomers adopt cultural traits of their new surroundings. Different studies have found acculturation to be associated in negative and positive ways with health and sometimes no association has been found between acculturation and health. The approach in this study has revealed that among the P'urepecha population in the U.S., standardized measures of acculturation are not predictive of poor health outcomes. This supports the idea that acculturation is not a universal process within the different Latin American origin immigrant groups. In future, it is critical we continue to move away from the impulse to lump immigrant groups together otherwise our ability to understand disease formation will be negatively impacted. As a society, this is something we cannot afford as chronic conditions continue to impact a greater number of individuals.   

In comparing two segments of the same population, this study found that metabolic and cardiac risk factors cluster differently among P'urepecha in Mexico vs. P'urepecha in the United States. In the latter there are two clusters among the sample. In one cluster, conditions such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar are present together with measures of obesity such as high body mass index (BMI), high waist and hip circumference. The second cluster in the U.S. does not have high cholesterol, blood sugar, or blood pressure and does not have high measures of obesity. In Mexico, there is a third cluster in addition to these two: there are high measures of obesity but no high blood pressure, cholesterol, or diabetes without any other significant differences between the clusters. Future work will attempt to untangle the reasons for the difference in health risk clustering.

This research project has had positive effects beyond scientific advancement. During the course of the project, the co-PI has had the opportunity to provide mentoring to undergraduate students who are interested in pursuing a graduate education. The majority of these students are women of color. In addition, the results of this research will serve P'urepecha communities in Mexico as they continue on the path toward greater self-governance. Specifically, as communities can use this information in their quest to gain a greater allocation toward health of the budget due to them from the state and federal governments.

"Human population history has been shaped by many factors, including pathogen experience.  This doctoral dissertation project investigates genomic signatures of past natural selection events to identify potential genetic factors contributing to current susceptibility and resistance to a mosquito-borne pathogen. The project's anthropological genetics and evolutionary medicine approaches will advance knowledge about human population history, paleopathology, and paleoepidemiology, and inform clinical research and policy on mosquito-borne pathogens that increasingly threaten regions including the United States. The project will also support training and mentoring of students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields, international research collaborations, and public science and health education and outreach.  

Dengue virus is a mosquito-borne RNA pathogen related to yellow-fever and West Nile virus. It is widespread in sub-tropic and tropic environments, with estimates as high as 390 million infections annually, resulting in 25,000 deaths. The investigators aim to identify host genetic factors contributing to dengue virus susceptibility and resistance in a Maya/Ladino population, by investigating past evolutionary events that left signatures of natural selection in the genomes of Mesoamericans (n=360). The project goals are to identify: 1) host genetic risk factors for dengue infection; 2) host genetic risk factors for disease progression; and 3) genetic variants contributing to immune response measured via two molecules, cytokines and growth factors. For genetic analysis, 384 genetic variants will be tested for associations with infection status, disease progression, and immune response. The results from this study will provide a framework for other researchers interested in studying modern infectious diseases using evolutionary perspectives.

This study, situated in Guatemala, promoted collaborations between the University of Michigan and the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance and focused on studying Dengue from an evolutionary medicine perspective. Infectious diseases, like dengue viral infection (DENV), are among the strongest selective pressures on the human genome. Given that the human genome embeds a history of resistance to past infectious pathogens within its code known as signatures of selection, the present is inseparable from its past. Therefore, the variants that underwent selection shape the way bodies respond to modern pathogens. Unlike various other studies that reconstruct past signatures of selection in light of maintained selection pressures or historical anecdotes, this study uses signatures of selection as a starting point to understand a modern pathogen, which has not had sufficient evolutionary time to leave a signature of its own.


Here our study design searched for signatures of selection related to immune response in a modern Mesoamerican population. We successfully reconstructed Mesoamerican population history from about 10,000 years ago to the present, including a population bottleneck associated with the timing of colonial contact. We dated these haplotypes and showed that they first arose in response to the establishment of city-states in Mesoamerica and hypothesized that important immune response loci such as HLA, increased in frequency as part of the introduction of Afro-Eurasian infectious diseases. This selection scan shed light to genes and pathways important to modern medicine, such as the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-&gamma;) signaling pathway, as well as a cytochrome gene related to statin metabolism that is at high frequencies in populations of Mesoamerican ancestry and may be useful for recommendation of specific medicines. These genes that have undergone selection are regions that heavily influence phenotypic change and are functionally different than wild-type alleles. This aids anthropologists in reconstructing population history and evolution and is also an attractive strategy to nominate these genes as candidate loci for other infectious disease as opposed to a whole genome approach.


Next, we recruited a case control cohort of dengue infected individuals in Guatemala during the 2018 and 2019 years. We found in our epidemiological surveys that factors related to water accumulation including water security, water storage, and nearby trash greatly increased the risk for dengue-infection in Guatemala likely by providing additional breeding grounds for mosquito. For our genetic analyses, we subset the participants using extreme phenotyping and exome sequenced a case-control cohort. We also measured their antibody levels to confirm presence and absence of dengue infection. Lastly, we measured cytokine levels using a multiplex system to determine if which cytokines were upregulated or downregulated during infection. Among our findings are that IL-10 cytokine is significantly associated with dengue infection in our Guatemalan cohort. Furthermore, we see associations in genetic markers in the STAT1 pathway. 


This study provides a foundation for future studies to target unique alleles that influence a phenotypic change, thus providing a framework for an evolutionary medicine approach. This emphasis on compiling outlying genes will be particularly beneficial to studies conducted on smaller sample sizes as it provides greater statistical power given that these outlying genes have greater effects physiologically more so than other genomic regions. This approach would be successful in various worldwide populations with similar histories and infectious disease burdens. 


Lastly, our research also sheds light as to what the greatest epidemiological risk factors in Guatemala are, and what direction and prevention strategies the Ministry of Public Health should focus on. Our research provides a better understanding of the immunological pathways associated with DENV-infection and facilitates the identification specific biological pathways for treatment and prevention measures such as in-vitro mouse models and ultimately vaccines. We thank all the participants, all of the support from local Guatemalan researchers, and all of the students at the University of Michigan that contributed to this study.

"Understanding how patterns of primate adaptation relate to ecological opportunity and competition is important for reconstructing primate and hominin biodiversity through time. This doctoral dissertation project will advance knowledge about primate adaptation using a quantitative and comparative framework to examine ecological pressures on skeletal shape and diversity for Eocene and Miocene fossil primates, with comparison to fossil rodent taxa. This project involves training and mentoring of undergraduate students, including from groups underrepresented in STEM research, outreach activities to high school students, and public sharing of scanned data through Morphosource.

This project will examine the adaptive variability and morphological diversity of primate clades broadly (comparing primates to rodents) and specifically (comparing different primate clades). Disparity and morphotype will be quantified using dental topography of middle Eocene - middle Miocene endemic primates and rodents from both continents. Dental topography will be reconstructed through time and analyzed using phylogenetic comparative methods, allowing for the statistical comparison of disparity and morphotype between different clades and landmasses through time at set intervals. Specifically, this project will 1) test whether the diversification patterns of anthropoid primates differ significantly through time between Afro-Arabia and South America, and compare these patterns to those of hystricognath rodents on the same continents, and 2) identify shifts in dental topographic morphotype throughout the primate and rodent lineages of both continents and assess whether these shifts share similarities and/or differences in timing, degree, and magnitude.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,SUNY at Stony Brook,NY,13596,1824745,John.Fleagle@Stonybrook.edu,John,Fleagle,1,"Morphological diversity, or ‘disparity’ hereafter, has been qualitatively used to describe the adaptive ability and evolutionary success of clades. The primary goal of this project was to quantify and document the post-dispersal dental disparity and morphotype trajectories for the endemic Afro-Arabian and South American primate and rodent clades. Dental disparity, morphotype, and lineage diversity trajectories were compared between sister-clades on different continents (e.g. diversification patterns of African anthropoids were compared to those of South American anthropoids), and between primates and rodents on the same continent. These comparisons allowed for the assessment of the effects of ecological factors such as competition and climate change on dental disparity and lineage.

This goal was encompassed within the co-PI's PhD dissertation thesis, which has three specific objectives: 1) test whether the diversification patterns of anthropoid primates differ significantly through time between Afro-Arabia and South America, and assess how these patterns compare to those of hystricognath rodents on the same continents; 2) test whether higher competition levels in Afro-Arabia limited the dental topographic disparity of Afro-Arabian anthropoids and hystricognath rodents compared to their South American sister taxa; and 3) identify shifts in dental topographic morphotype throughout the primate and rodent fossil records of both continents and assess whether these shifts share similarities and/or differences in timing, degree, and magnitude between orders as well as between landmasses.

Diversification patterns of dental shape were quantified for the endemic primate and rodent clades in Africa and South America. The total sample included 456 specimens and 226 species, covering the majority of the fossil record from the Eocene to the Miocene. Digital surface files of the second lower molar were created for each of these specimens. Dental topographic values were calculated for each specimen using these digital surface files. Digital surface files will be made publicly available accompanying the publication of the results of this project.

 

Diversification patterns in dental topography were compared between primates and rodents on the same continent. The effects of within-group competition were tested for by comparing the levels of dental topographic disparity of the African clades to those of their South American sister clades. Shifts in dental topographic disparity and morphotype were identified and compared in timing between different groups, arrival times of potential competitors, and to global climatic events.

 

The co-PI trained and mentored four undergraduate research assistants in assisting with the making of dental casts, processing of microCT scan data, and working on small research projects that the students presented at undergraduate research symposia.

"Infant and juvenile primates must navigate a complex nutritional world, even before they have fully developed the mechanical, behavioral, physiological, and microbial adaptations used by adults. Folivorous species, which rely on diets high in fibrous foods like leaves, face an especially challenging nutritional environment requiring specialized strategies and adaptations. These adaptations include a symbiotic gastrointestinal microbiome, which plays a central role in the breakdown and capture of nutrients from high-fiber foods. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the role of the microbiome in the nutritional strategy of a folivorous primate during juvenile growth and development, advancing knowledge about the primate microbiome, nutrition and life history adaptations. The project will support student training and mentoring in STEM research, several cross-institutional and international collaborations, community science and conservation outreach. 

Investigators will focus on Gorilla beringei, as they occupy a unique nutritional niche in an extreme ecology; they live at high altitudes with very limited availability of high-energy food sources (e.g. ripe fruit). As a specialist folivore, they are a useful model for testing the relationship between nutritional development and life history. Project aims will address 1) the nutritional intake and feeding strategies of infant and juvenile mountain gorillas; 2) the dynamics of the gastrointestinal microbiome in infants and juveniles; and 3) the functional contribution of the microbiome as a nutritional strategy.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,CUNY Hunter College,NY,28080,1826756,jessica.rothman@hunter.cuny.edu,Jessica,Rothman,1,"Food resources are fundamental to the lives of all animals, with the nutrients from food resources acting as essential currencies for all biological processes. Non-human primates are no exception to this rule, and the continual need to meet nutritional goals are key in shaping much of wild primate behavior, demography, and biogeography. Leaf eating primates rely on high fiber diets face challenging nutritional environments that require specialized strategies and adaptations. This includes the presence of a symbiotic gastrointestinal microbiome, which plays a central role in the breakdown and capture of nutrients from high-fiber foods. As with many other nutritional strategies, the microbiome develops after birth, meaning that infants and juveniles may be vulnerable to falling short of their nutritional requirements. This in turn has implications for the patterning of growth and development, and for the evolution of life history.

At the heart of this dissertation project is a single question - how do infants and juveniles navigate a complex nutritional world, before they have fully developed the mechanical, behavioral, physiological, and microbial adaptations that adults rely on for this same task? This project considered this question in mountain gorillas, Gorilla beringei, as they occupy a unique nutritional niche at an extreme ecology; they live at high altitudes with limited availability of high-energy food sources (e.g. ripe fruit). Accordingly, they are an interesting model to test the relationship between nutritional development and life history.

            Our unique multilayered approach, considered behavior, diet, nutrition, microbiomics, and metabolomics and provided new insights into the diets and nutritional strategies of immature primates. The project elucidated three main strategies by which mountain gorillas compensate for the constraints of immaturity: 1) differential reliance on food items, including increased consumption of highly digestibly foods as well as self-selection of a balance of nutrients higher in non-protein energy intake relative to protein intake, 2) compensatory foraging and increased overall foraging effort to compensate for biophysiological limitations (i.e. gut size) and behavioral limitations (feeding/foraging competency), and 3) extended use of mother?s milk as a nutritional ?buffer? during periods of preferred food scarcity.

            Additionally, the unique characterization of the gastrointestinal microbiome of infant and juvenile mountain gorillas provided new insights into potential microbial strategies associated with immaturity. This characterization uncovered that the infant mountain gorilla microbiome is less diverse than those of juvenile and adult individuals, with higher abundance of key hydrogenotrophic taxa and sulfate-reducing bacteria. These taxa may play a role in preventing hydrogen accumulation in the gut during development. Additionally, this project showed that there are differences in the abundance of major phyletic groups (specifically, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes), suggesting that immature individuals may house microbiomes with greater capacity for energy harvest, potentially as an adaptation to maximize nutrient availability during periods of growth and development more sensitive to environmental perturbation and dietary shortfalls.

This project fostered several cross-institutional collaborations, and included active participation of national and international collaborators, including researchers from the University of Minnesota and the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA). This project?s broader impacts include the dissemination of results to the UWA to help inform park wardens (and in turn, visiting tourists) regarding infant and juvenile gorilla nutrition; research opportunities and mentorship to minority students at a minority-serving institution; outreach to public audiences and to high-school programming; and participation with non-profit initiatives in science communication and translation of research.

"In primate communities there are multiple examples of coexisting species that overlap substantially in their use of dietary and other ecological resources in the same habitat. Discovering the mechanisms by which they are able to coexist is important for understanding how ecological communities are formed and is vital for conservation efforts. This dissertation project will examine the role of nutrition in primate species coexistence, investigating how different primate species who consume the same foods may select different amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrate, and other nutrients that result in a species-specific nutritional profile. By collecting behavioral, dietary, and nutritional data it is possible to quantify these nutritional profiles and examine the amount of overlap among them. This project provides a novel approach for conservation efforts because it will potentially uncover the nutrient balance necessary for the success of individual species. In addition, the Co-PI will provide training in lab-based nutritional ecology methods to undergraduates from underrepresented groups in STEM fields, and the project will involve international research collaborations with Malagasy colleagues and students. The Co-PI will also engage in conservation and scientific outreach at K-12 schools in the US and field locations.

The project will investigate the role of the nutrition in maintaining species coexistence in four species of lemurs: the Milne-Edward's sifaka, the Verreaux's sifaka, the red-fronted lemur, and the red-tailed sportive lemur. The project will apply the Nutritional Geometry framework, which models how organisms balance multiple nutritional components, to identify the nutritional goals of each species and examine their degree of nutritional specialization. The project will also examine if there are sex-differences resulting in sex-specific nutrient goals, and finally, it will examine whether this nutritional approach is more informative for understanding coexistence than previous methods that used solely diet and microhabitat characteristics.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,CUNY Hunter College,NY,25200,1826509,jessica.rothman@hunter.cuny.edu,Jessica,Rothman,1,"Understanding how species share resources and coexist is important for deciphering the formation of ecological communities and is vital for conservation efforts. Species coexistence is proposed to rely on the ability of each species to differentiate their ecological niches by using different resources. The goal of this research was to examine the role of nutrition and nutrient balancing as a way in which species separate their niches. This project examined the nutritional intake and nutrient balancing of three lemur species, the Milne-Edward’s sifaka (Propithecus edwardsi), the Verreaux’s sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi), and the red-fronted lemur (Eulemur rufifrons) in Madagascar. This was assessed by incorporating a species’ nutritional decisions into the niche concept and by investigating whether these decisions were informative of a species’ ability to coexist with ecologically similar species. An additional goal of the project was to test whether there were sex-specific differences in the nutritional niche due to the unequal costs of reproduction.

         Fieldwork was in two field sites in Madagascar over 12 months with &gt;1000 hours of behavioral observation data, &gt;250 food samples collected and nutritional analysis was conducted. Preliminary results indicate that each species maintained a consistent species-specific balance of energy to protein with a balance of 11:1 (energy to protein) for E. rufifrons at Ranomafana National Park, 5.6:1 for P. verreauxi, and 4.6:1 for P. edwardsi. The balance of 11:1 for E. rufifrons suggest a highly frugivorous daily balance similar to that reported for other frugivorous species and consistent with the project’s predictions. The balances of 5.6:1 and 4.6:1 for the two Propithecus species is more similar to omnivorous species. Preliminary mineral analysis suggests calcium in the diet is higher than has previously been reported, for Malagasy primates; however, they fall in the range reported in other primate diets.

         Data analysis is ongoing and will address the other hypotheses and predictions of the project including: 1) Species-specific nutritional niches will be found and correspond to whether each species is a nutrient specialist or generalist; 2) Sex-specific nutritional niches will result from females overexploiting high quality food resources; 3) Greater niche separation will be found using the nutritional niche framework than through the use of microhabitat and diet characteristics. Key outcomes of the project include academic papers that are being prepared for publication, presentations of research to conservation leaders, governmental officials, park authorities, and university seminars, as well as conservation outreach to local school children in Madagascar. Mentorship and training were provided to underrepresented minorities and women in STEM at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

"Humans are unique among primates in many ways, including that we are bipedal (walk upright) and our bodies take a long time to reach adult size and shape. Our hominin ancestors are categorized as such based on evidence for bipedality, but relatively little is known about hominin bipedalism with respect to growth and development. This doctoral dissertation project will use comparative primate skeletal material to assess how hand and foot bones change during growth in response to changes in locomotor (movement) behaviors. The research will advance knowledge about how growth impacts adult bone, with application to the hominin fossil record and the potential to inform clinical research on bone and growth. The project will also train future scientists, provide K-12 science curriculum content to a diverse range of local students, and contribute 3D digital data to online databases.

The researchers will use micro-computed tomography and comparative analyses of trabecular bone measurements (as a proxy for locomotion) for multiple elements in the hands and feet of five modern primates in dentally-defined age groups, in order to accomplish the following: 1) describe ontogenetic trajectories of trabecular change in a phylogenetic context as it relates to known behavioral changes in primates representing several locomotor modes; 2) investigate the unexplored relationship of phylogenetic signal and age in trabecular bone; 3) improve understanding of the evolutionary pattern and adaptive significance of primate locomotor ontogeny, including modern humans; and 4) reconstruct hominin locomotor behavior over ontogeny based on comparisons to modern taxa. The results of this project will help address longstanding debates about hominin evolution and better inform future studies of primate ontogeny, form, function, systematics, and locomotion.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,American Museum Natural History,NY,19432,1825467,willhs@amnh.org,William,Harcourt-Smith,1,"Despite decades of research, considerable debate still surrounds the locomotor (movement) behavior of our hominin ancestors. To reliably reconstruct those behaviors, it is imperative to first understand the relationship between behavior and skeletal development in living primates. This project used comparative primate skeletal material to assess how hand and foot bones change during growth in response to changes in locomotor behaviors. I used micro-computed tomography and comparative analyses of trabecular bone measurements (as a proxy for locomotion) for multiple elements in the hands and feet of five modern primate species in dentally-defined age groups to explore several hypotheses. I found that trabecular bone largely changes through development concordant with changes in locomotor behavior. As such, I created a predictive model that may make it possible to predict trabecular change through development given behavioral hypotheses. In an exploration of shape change through development, I found that bone shape changes through development, but not in line with locomotor change. I also found support for the hypothesis that selection for the bipedal foot of modern Homo sapiens resulted in morphological changes in the hand that were exapted for manipulation. Lastly, I found that Homo naledi, a fossil hominin, likely had a distinct locomotor repertoire with limited capabilities for complex bipedal behavior such as running. The synthetic conclusion of this work is that hand and foot bones change through development, sometimes as a result of shared developmental patterns, and sometimes due to locomotor changes through development.

This project resulted in the successful completion and defense of a dissertation research project, the presentation of such research in an academic conference environment, several publications in preparation, collegial relationships between academic institutions, the creation of an after-school course for underrepresented high school students at the American Museum of Natural History, and a student presentation award at the American Association of Physical Anthropology Meetings.

"The cost of evolving a large brain, like the human brain, is hypothesized to require energetic trade-offs, such that increases in brain metabolism may require reductions in energy used for growth and reproduction. However, additional comparative data on brain metabolism (the rate at which energy is used) are needed to better investigate these potential trade-offs. Because direct measurements are difficult to obtain for most living species and impossible for extinct ones, this doctoral dissertation project will use measurements obtained from skeletal features affected by brain metabolic demands to infer rates of brain metabolism in a broad group of mammals. Comparing how and why mammals may vary in the energy they expend on the brain relative to their body's metabolism will advance knowledge in primate and human biology and brain evolution. This project will generate numerous 3D scans of skulls that will be used for student mentoring and public outreach at Duke University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. These data will also be released for public access on the digital archive MorphoSource, which will yield further research and educational utility.

Previous studies suggest that the size of foramina that transmit the brain's arteries may be used to predict brain glucose utilization rates in euarchontans. This project aims to further evaluate the use of these foramina to test energetic hypotheses of brain size evolution. Diameters of the transverse foramina (which transmit the vertebral artery) and carotid canals (which transmit the internal carotid artery) will be measured from osteological and 3-D digitized specimens obtained from high-resolution computed tomography scans, respectively, in a broad taxonomic sample of marsupials, glirans, afrotheres, xenarthrans, and some carnivorans. A study of bony canal area and predicted blood flow rate change through ontogeny in a cadaveric osteological sample of humans will also be conducted to further elucidate the relationship between foramen size, brain size, and brain metabolism. Using these data, this project will test the extent to which large brains in primates and other mammals are sustained by increasing the body's metabolic rate. This research will further the understanding of human brain evolution within the context of mammalian brain evolution.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Duke University,NC,27566,1825129,doug.boyer@duke.edu,Douglas,Boyer,1,"How much energy does the human brain use compared to other mammals? It is said that the human brain uses about 1/5 of the body’s daily energy. It is hypothesized that the energetic cost of the human brain has influenced the evolution of several behavioral and anatomical features that represent a tradeoff between supplying energy to a large, energy-demanding brain while reducing the energy costs of other body functions. However, a testing such hypotheses have been hampered by a lack of comparative data for the energetic costs of brains in non-human mammals. This is because it is difficult (or too invasive) to directly measure metabolic rates (the rate in which energy is used) for the brain in most non-human animals.

This project utilized an alternate strategy to estimate brain metabolic rates in a broad sample of mammals, including other primates (lemurs, monkeys, and apes), marsupials (kangaroos, opossums, and their kin), carnivorans (bears, raccoons, weasels, and their kin), rodents and rabbits, and afrotheres (elephant shrews, golden moles, and their kin). Specifically, blood flow rates to the brain were calculated from measurements of openings in the skull and neck bones (cervical vertebrae) that pass arteries to the brain. The premise was that 1) size of bony openings reflect the size of arteries within them, 2) size of the artery are related to blood flow rate, and 3) blood flow rates to the brain are directly related to the energy use of the brain because blood brings the brain the oxygen and nutrients necessary to produce energy.

This project first tested the relationship of bone measurements, blood flow rate, and brain metabolism in a sample of humans through growth. In human children, brain metabolism and blood flow rate changes as the brain grows. We found that pattern of change in brain metabolism in human juveniles reflected pattern of change in total blood flow to the brain estimated from measurements of the bones, confirming the relationship between the size of bony passages for brain arteries and the metabolic rate of the brain.

After conducting few more validation tests, the same technique used for the human sample was used to estimate blood flow rates to the brain of 301 species of mammals, for which measurements were collected from approximately 1,400 specimens. Funds from this award were utilized to travel to four U.S. natural history collections to collect measurements and to newly acquire high-resolution x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans of mammal skulls. Blood flow rates were converted to estimates of brain metabolism using analytical techniques (Bayesian methods) that take uncertainty and potential errors into account.

We found that while humans do use a high proportion of their body’s metabolic rate for their brain, they were not the only mammal species to do so. Some marsupials, rodents, and primates had comparatively high brain metabolic rates while many carnivorans had comparatively low brain metabolic rates for their body metabolic rates. Furthermore, we found that having a relatively high brain metabolic rate is associated with having reduced costs for reproduction across the mammals sampled (as represented by having fewer offspring per reproductive event and having larger spacing between births).

Taken together, the results of this project contributed to a key theme in evolutionary biology and anthropology: to better understand brain evolution in humans and other primates. First, the project demonstrated the continued utility of using bone measurements to estimate brain metabolic rate in species for which direct measurements will likely never be available. It also suggested through comparisons with a wide sample of mammals that the cost of the human (and generally, the primate) brain is offset by reducing the energy used to reproduce. This broad view through the lens of mammalian evolution adds further context to the evolution of the characteristics which define humans. These findings are reported in the Co-PI’s dissertation (completed in 2020) and are currently being prepared as manuscript submissions for publication.

Throughout its lifetime, this project has also produced 460 high-resolution CT scans of the skulls of 178 species of placental and marsupial mammals. These data are deposited in the public data repository MorphoSource, where they will be accessible to the public for use in research, education, and non-commercial creative endeavors at no cost. These data have already been used to build new scientific collaborations and for educational outreach by the PI and Co-PI. Representing species from across the world, many of which have not had publicly accessible scans available before, the dataset generated by this project will provide a bountiful resource for education and research into the relationships of the structure and function of the mammalian skull.

"Reconstructing the locomotor behaviors of early human ancestors remains a central task in elucidating the origins of the hominin lineage. Because of its role in weight-bearing the heel bone (calcaneus), which has been relatively understudied, has great potential for illuminating the nature of both terrestrial and arboreal locomotion. The goal of this dissertation project is to determine how calcaneal external shape and internal structure vary with locomotor behaviors within and among humans and non-human great apes. Project findings will be used to provide context for interpreting fossil hominin calcanei, thus strengthening reconstructions of early hominin locomotion. This project will lead to a large database of surface and micro-CT scans that will be made available to the scientific community. It will also support the training of a female graduate student and undergraduates in quantitative techniques, and engage public and K-12 audiences in science outreach.  

The calcaneus has a central role in weight bearing, foot inversion and contact with the substrate. Although previous studies have found differences in specific aspects of external shape and internal structure related to locomotor mode, this project will examine the entire external and internal morphology. The project will include quantification of calcaneal shape and trabecular structure in its entirety through a 3D geometric morphometric sliding semilandmark analysis and recently developed trabecular techniques. The student co-PI will analyze how calcaneal morphology varies with locomotor behavior, body size, and phylogeny and apply these findings to fossil hominins to increase our understanding of hominin use of arboreal behavior.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Johns Hopkins University,MD,32742,1824630,asylves4@jhmi.edu,Adam,Sylvester,1,"Reconstructing the locomotor behaviors of early human ancestors remains critical for understanding human evolution because locomotion provides access to critical resources, such as food, water, shelter, and potential mates. Reconstructing entire locomotor repertoires will necessitate determining the importance of tree climbing in the early stages of human evolution. The heel bone (calcaneus) has the potential to inform our knowledge of the nature of such locomotor behaviors because of its role in weight-bearing and contact with the substrate. For this project, I have analyzed the relationship between calcaneus external shape and differences in locomotor behaviors (specifically degree of tree climbing), body size, and evolutionary relationships in human and nonhuman primates. Once these relationships were better understood, the results provided a context for interpreting fossil hominin calcanei.

Relative to differences in body size, humans exhibit relatively larger calcanei than nonhuman primates as an adaptation to walking on two legs. Among nonhuman primates, those groups that spend more time climbing trees exhibit adaptations for increased foot mobility, which would be necessary for moving through unpredictable environments. Those nonhuman primates that spend more time traveling on the ground exhibit a relatively wider calcaneus as an adaptation for increased consistent ground contact. These results are also seen on a small-scale, such as among different species of gorillas, demonstrating morphological differences relative to subtle differences in locomotor behavior. Based on these findings the early human ancestor, Australopithecus afarensis (approximately 3.2 million years ago), which is the oldest in the sample, has the most modern human-like calcaneus of the fossil specimens in the study. Over the course of the next two million years the calcanei of early human ancestors (attributed to A. sediba, A. africanus, and Homo habilis/Paranthropus boisei) exhibit unique combinations of human and nonhuman primate traits indicating the use of both tree climbing and travel on the ground. It is not until H. naledi (about 240,000-360,000 years ago), that there is another modern human-like calcaneus. Based on current thoughts on the evolutionary relationships of these early human ancestors, these findings suggest that A. afarensis was an evolutionary experiment, or that locomotor behavior shifted from being more modern human-like to a more arboreal mixed-form over evolutionary time.

This study has been the first to examine the relationship between entire external shape of the human and nonhuman primate calcaneus varies relative to differences in locomotor behavior through the use of three-dimensional geometric morphometric sliding semilandmark analyses. The results of this study demonstrate that this methodology can serve as a powerful tool for detecting differences in postcranial bony shape relative to subtle differences in locomotor behavior. These results have been shared with the general public through the Expert Is In program at the National Museum of Natural History. This project has led to a large database of surface scans and micro-CT scans that will be made available to the scientific community at the conclusion of the project. Work on this project will be continued through the analysis of the internal structure of the calcaneus relative to known differences in locomotor behavior among humans and nonhuman primates.

"This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the impact of kinship in shaping patterns of present-day human genetic diversity and explore ancestries of individuals in the African diaspora in the United States. The investigators will characterize the genomic diversity of archaeological individuals and descendant populations from the 17th century Chesapeake colonies of Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware.  This project's interdisciplinary approach combines DNA data from past and contemporary descendant populations with archeological, archival and historical information to better understand how demographic processes in the past have shaped present-day genetic variation. The investigators will work closely with historical and genealogical societies and hold outreach workshops discussing the application of genetics to inform historical, family, and personal genealogical research questions. These workshops will contribute to public science education for adult learners, enhancing scientific literacy surrounding the interpretation of genetic ancestry results.

The investigators will conduct a diachronic assay of genetic variation to assess the impact of kinship in shaping patterns of human genetic diversity in colonization contexts. They will collaborate with historical and genealogical societies to recruit 150 study participants with genealogical ties to the 17th century Chesapeake colonies and characterize mitochondrial DNA, Y-chromosome and autosomal SNP variation using the GenoChip 2.0 microarray. Complete mitochondrial and whole nuclear genome shotgun sequencing will also be conducted on 29 individuals from two archaeological sites, Patuxent Point (1650-1680, Maryland) and Avery's Rest (1680-1710, Delaware). Patterns of genetic ancestry and levels of endogamy within these sample populations will be characterized to determine geographic origins and possible kin relations. The results will provide insights into the population dynamics of the first 100 years of European colonization and the genetic legacy of colonization in the Chesapeake region, and provide ancient DNA data from 17th century European colonists and enslaved African individuals from colonial North America.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Pennsylvania,PA,32200,1825583,tgschurr@sas.upenn.edu,Theodore,Schurr,1,"The National Science Foundation's support of ""Genetic Diversity of the Colonial Chesapeake: Insights into Kinship and the Trans-Atlantic Colonization of the United States"" seeks to understand how contemporary human genetic diversity has been shaped by historical period migrations of European and African descended persons during the 17th century in the Chesapeake Bay region (Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware) of the United States, and, in particular how biological kinship has structured these migrations. This information is important to understand early colonial migration histories of European and African persons in eastern North America. Knowledge about this period has been classically approached through archival or archaeological research. However, individual histories may not be fully reconstructed in the cases of limited documentary records. This is especially relevant in helping understand the histories of enslaved African and African descended persons in colonial North America.

To understand these early colonial period histories using DNA technologies, we collected DNA samples from 17th century individuals from the Avery's Rest and Patuxent Point archaeological sites for genomic sequencing, and DNA samples from 21st century descendent communities through the St. Mary's Historical Society. DNA samples from the Patuxent Point and Avery's Rest archaeological individuals were analyzed at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. We were able to successfully extract and sequence DNAs for all of the Avery's Rest individuals, and 12 of the 18 Patuxent Point individuals. For the contemporary DNA samples, we successfully consented and enrolled 128 individuals through the St. Mary's Historical Society in 2019. Cheek swabs were taken from all study participants and analyzed with the GenoChip 2.0 microarray at Family Tree DNA. The resulting data were then analyzed using statistical approaches to characterize ancestry and relatedness.

We characterized the autosomal (whole genome) ancestries of the archaeological individuals at Avery's Rest and Patuxent Point, which indicated they were affiliated with either European or African populations. At Avery's Rest, eight individuals were associated with European populations and three individuals with African populations. For the individuals with African ancestry, our analyses indicated they have connections with different regional areas in west and west-central Africa. This finding suggests that early patterns of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade were varied for the Delaware region. More detailed analyses of the European ancestry components for individuals at Avery's Rest indicate associations with populations in northern and western Europe. Similar conclusions were also reached for the Patuxent Point individuals, who were all of European descent. These findings are significant as they directly support historical information about colonization histories in the region, and provide previously unknown details about the origins the individual histories of African individuals who were forcibly enslaved. These results are additionally novel as they represent some of the earliest published ancient DNA results for colonial period populations in North America.

To more deeply explore the continuity between past and present populations, genomic ancestry was also characterized for the 21st century descendant study participants using the GenoChip 2.0 microarray. Ancestries based on autosomal SNP data were identified as primarily European or African. A small degree of overlap in the maternal and paternal ancestries of the archaeological individuals and the contemporary study participants were also identified. This suggest that they likely share similar source populations due to overlapping colonial histories, although direct genealogical connections through the maternal or paternal lines were not established. In the future, autosomal comparisons will be conducted to verify the extent of any shared genomic ancestry.

Our findings also suggest that individuals buried at the Patuxent Point and Avery's Rest archaeological sites shared some degree of genetic kinship. This was first indicated by the predominance of a single maternal DNA haplogroup at Patuxent Point and Avery's Rest, respectively. In addition, autosomal analyses identified multiple first and second degree relationships within each archaeological site. These results are novel as they represent the first identification of genetic kinship in colonial period North America. They suggest that kinship was an important factor in European settlement, and also was retained between individuals of African descent who were likely enslaved. In the future, we will analyze the degree of relatedness within the 17th descendant study participants to understand how kinship may influence contemporary genetic diversity.

As a whole, this research project has revealed the genetic ancestry and kinship among archaeological and contemporary populations that will help us to better understand the population history of the early Chesapeake colonial period. This information is important to elucidate the processes of colonization and how it is has potentially shaped contemporary genetic diversity in the region today.

"The emerging field of ancient microbiome research is providing crucial baseline data for understanding the role of agriculture and social organization in shaping the human oral microbiome over the past several thousand years. However, additional transitional historical data are needed to enhance our understanding of how oral microbial ecology has responded to recent sociocultural change in the last 125 years. This dissertation project will investigate changes in the human oral microbiome from 1890 to the modern day, to provide insights into recent evolution and diversity of the oral microbiome, and sociocultural influences on microbiome structure and function. The project will support training and mentoring of students, including those from groups underrepresented in STEM research, and may also inform clinical microbiome research. Research findings will be shared across disciplines through peer-reviewed publications and presentations, and communicated to the public through outreach at participating natural history museums. 

Through both wet and dry laboratory methods, our research objectives are to 1) characterize the oral microbiome of diverse early 20th century Americans and 2) investigate ecological changes in microbial communities and their metabolic functions over time. To achieve these objectives, dental calculus (tartar) will be collected from geographically and ethnically diverse Americans housed in natural history skeletal collections and living populations residing in the NY metropolitan area. Microbial DNA recovered through shotgun sequencing will be used to reconstruct taxonomic and functional diversity of the oral microbiome. Providing this historical context to the modern microbiome will contribute to our understanding of microbiome ecology, human health and disease in the modern era.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Rutgers University New Brunswick,NJ,22243,1826220,siobain@sebs.rutgers.edu,Siobain,Duffy,1,"A modern innovation in biological anthropology has been a shift into microbiological anthropology: the study of the microbes that coexist with humans.  The oral microbiome is intensively studied in modern humans because it causes disease (cavities, periodontal disease) in a majority of humans.  By sequencing the preserved DNA in dental calculus (tartar, the mineralized plaque that forms during life and persists after death), we can see how much the oral microbiome has changed over time.  We sequenced the preserved DNA in calculus from Americans who lived in New York City, Cleveland, in the Washington DC area and on Kodiak Island, Alaska and died from 1897-1950.  We found major differences with modern American oral plaque microbiomes both in the major types of bacteria found and our historical microbiomes had a large component of archaeal genes (average 14.7%) ? a kind of life not normally found in the mouths of modern Americans.  One Archaeal species in particular (Methanobrevibacter oralis) was detected in 41 of the 43 analyzed samples, and we were able to assemble whole genome sequences of this species from three different samples.  It is clear that the technological and cultural changes of the last century have had a strong effect on the microbiomes of our mouths.

The calculus sampled for the study came from remains identified as coming from Americans of European, African and Asian ancestry.  We did not find systematic differences in our data from samples from humans of different backgrounds or from different geographic locations. Our data suggest that the dental health of Americans from the recent past were similar to each other.

As all studies of historical oral microbiomes sequence DNA from dental calculus and all modern studies use DNA from plaque, we also conducted an important control analysis using modern humans.  We sampled and sequenced the microbiomes of both plaque and calculus from ten volunteers.  Modern calculus microbiomes were more similar to the supragingival plaque samples from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) than those from other sites in and on the human body. The microbiomes of each individual?s plaque and calculus were more closely related to each other than those from the HMP, but were not identical to each other (92.42%-94.1% overlap in detected species).  Our results justify the comparisons of modern plaque microbiomes and historical calculus microbiomes.

This project contributed to the professional development of a graduate student in the nascent field of evolutionary medicine and introduced an undergraduate to computational microbiome research.  This study is also the first to look at oral microbiomes from historical samples from non-European and non-European-descended human remains.

"Developmental programming refers to early life biological responses to the environment that can shape long-term well-being. The prenatal period is a critical window for developmental programming, with a variety of environmental signals being transmitted from a mother to her offspring, potentially reflected as ""epigenetic"" changes in offspring gene regulation. This dissertation project will advance our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms of adaptation by identifying correlations in gene regulation between a mother and her offspring and investigating the impact of acute and chronic maternal stressors on infant DNA methylation. The project will create STEM training opportunities in epigenetic research for undergraduate and graduate students. Results from this study will contribute to biocultural research on life history and social determinants of well-being, including for understudied populations, and will have the potential to inform clinical policy and practice. Findings will be disseminated to study participants and the general public through various venues, including prenatal care groups.

Developmental programming begins before birth, meaning that the experience of the mother is critical for offspring adaptability and fitness. Maternal signals transmitted to the offspring prenatally may represent the mother's total life history and/or the acute environment, including experiences of stress. One mechanism through which the offspring can respond to these signals is through epigenetic modifications, including changes in DNA methylation. The investigators will use infant DNA methylation at birth as a sensor of the prenatal environment, to assess how the offspring adapts to various maternal signals relayed during pregnancy. They will address whether infant methylation is more correlated with maternal methylation at 7-15 weeks, reflecting the cumulative life history of the mother before pregnancy as DNA methylation changes over the life course in response to the environment, or at 23-34 weeks, where maternal DNA methylation would be expected to change in response to the pregnancy-specific environment. A collection of DNA methylation marks that represent an ""epigenetic clock"" of chronological age will be used as a summary measure of life history in the mother and developmental maturity in the neonate.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Emory University,GA,31200,1825469,alicia.smith@emory.edu,Alicia,Smith,1,"According to the developmental programming hypothesis, humans adapt to their early environment in a way that shapes the remainder of their development. One way that this happens is through changes in DNA methylation, a structural modification to DNA that changes based on the environment, including exposure to stress. The goal of this study was to use DNA methylation of newborns as a sensor of exposure to maternal stress. We leveraged data and biological samples from the Emory University African American Microbiome in Pregnancy cohort, which collected basic demographic information on infants and their mothers, stress questionnaires used in this study, and blood spot samples from Georgia’s newborn screening program. We hypothesized that there would be multiple changes in DNA methylation associated with indicators of maternal stress. We also hypothesized that a measure of developmental maturity based on multiple neonatal methylation sites would associate with stress. We found that the methylation-based measure of developmental maturity was associated with gestational age at birth, but neither developmental maturity nor DNA methylation across the genome was associated with stress. While no significant associations were found, this study provides valuable pilot data for other studies of maternal stress and newborn epigenetics, which are highly relevant for the fields of Biological Anthropology, Women’s Health, and Epigenetics. Additionally, this project provided opportunities for training in sample management, DNA extraction, quality control, and bioinformatic methods for the PI as well as training for an undergraduate student who assisted with the project.

"Transcriptional cis - regulatory modules (CRMs) are DNA sequences required for regulating gene expression - determining when and where genes are turned ""on"" and ""off"". CRMs play critical roles with respect to normal variation between individuals, birth defects, chronic diseases, and evolution. Despite the clear importance for many areas of biology, these sequences are not well-documented. The REDfly (Regulatory Element Database for Fly) database helps fill this gap in CRM annotation by curating known CRMs and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) for the important research organism Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). REDfly is the most detailed existing platform for regulatory element annotation for any animal. It's records include over 16,000 experimentally verified CRMs and 2000 TFBSs along with their DNA sequence, their associated genes, and the gene expression patterns they direct. REDfly is a well-used and valuable resource for the genomics, bioinformatics, and Drosophila communities and is an important platform for supporting hypothesis-driven empirical and computational research. It has contributed to numerous studies in multiple areas relating to non-Drosophila as well as Drosophila systems including CRM biology, CRM discovery, construction of regulatory network models, interpretation of genomic datasets, and CRM evolution. The current project will focus on continued curation and maintenance of the database so that it remains up to date and functions with maximum utility for its users. This will ensure that REDfly continues to be available as an important source of raw data for analysis, hypothesis generation, assessment and validation, and empirical research in molecular and developmental biology, genetics, genomics, bioinformatics, and evolution. The current project also has a valuable undergraduate education component. It will continue to be the focus of a University at Buffalo course ""Genome Annotation"", in which the students participate in annotating regulatory elements for entry into REDfly, thus making genuine contributions to the research community while learning the techniques of genome annotation and biocuration and the science of gene regulation. In a new effort, a REDfly unit will be introduced into a Developmental Biology course at Baruch College-CUNY, one of the nation's most diverse campuses. Students who excel in the class will be invited to Buffalo to participate in the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program and serve as REDfly curators.

The specific objectives of this Sustaining Award are to keep REDfly up to date with the rapidly increasing numbers of CRMs and TFBSs being discovered and reported in the literature, and to maintain the REDfly site in a manner that will maximize its utility to the research community. The focus is on: (1) Curation. REDfly will be kept up - to - date as new studies are published. Emphasis will remain on in vivo assays, but in vitro studies will be included where encountered and appropriate. (2) Education. The PI will continue to use REDfly as the basis for his ""Genome Annotation"" course. A REDfly unit will be introduced in an undergraduate course at Baruch College-CUNY, and bring up to two course alumni to Buffalo each summer to work on REDfly curation as a part of the University at Buffalo Medical School's Summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (SURE) program. (3) Service. REDfly will continue to serve its user community with a high degree of responsiveness, including rapid response to queries, custom searches and downloads on request, error correction, and support for undergraduate courses. (4) General maintenance. REDfly will be maintained in peak operating condition through identification and correction of programming bugs, regular updates to genome annotations imported from FlyBase and other sources, active maintenance of links to outside resources, software and/or hardware updates, etc. These activities will ensure that REDfly data continue to be available as an important resource for the scientific community.

The original plan was to have students who exceled in the class come to Buffalo to participate in the University at Buffalo's Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program and serve as REDfly curators. This was unable to occur due to restrictions put into place on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, one student from the class was recruited to work remotely as a summer REDfly curator, managing to add over 5000 new records to the database. Another (local) student worked successfully on a project comparing REDfly regulatory sequence data to other data in the literature. All told, over 60 diverse undergraduate students participated in the REDfly class units over the duration of the award (despite pandemic disruptions), and two students received intensive summer research experiences.

"Large-scale in situ hybridization (ISH) screens are providing an abundance of data showing spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression that are valuable for understanding the mechanisms of gene regulation. Knowledge gained from analysis of Drosophila expression patterns is widely important, because a large number of genes involved in fruit fly development are commonly found in humans and other species. Thus, research efforts into the spatial and temporal characteristics of Drosophila gene expression images have been at the leading-edge of scientific investigations into the fundamental principles of different species development. Drosophila gene expression pattern images enable the integration of spatial expression patterns with other genomic datasets that link regulator with their downstream targets. This project addresses the computational challenges in analyzing Drosophila gene expression patterns by leveraging a new bioinformatics software system. It focuses on designing principled bioinformatics and computational biology algorithms and tools that will integrate multi-modal spatial patterns of gene expression for Drosophila embryos' developmental stage recognition and anatomical ontology term annotation, and will infer gene interaction networks to generate a more comprehensive picture of gene function and interaction. The bioinformatics methods resulting from the project activities are broadly applicable to a variety of fields such as biomedical science and engineering, systems biology, clinical pathology, oncology, and pharmaceutics. Novel tools to enhance courses and research experiences for diverse populations of students are planned to broaden participation in science. 

This project investigates three challenging problems for studying the Drosophila embryo ISH Images via innovative bioinformatics algorithms: 1) the sparse multi-dimensional feature learning method to integrate the multimodal spatial gene expression patterns for annotating Drosophila ISH images, 2) the heterogeneous multi-task learning models using the high-order relational graph to jointly recognize the developmental stages and annotate anatomical ontology terms, 3) the embedded sparse representation algorithm to infer the gene interaction network. It is innovative to apply structured sparse learning, multi-task learning, and high-order relational graph models to Drosophila gene expression patterns analysis and holds great promise for scientific investigations into the fundamental principles of animal development. The algorithms and tools as outcomes of this research are expected to help knowledge discovery for applications in broader scientific and biological domains with massive high-dimensional and heterogeneous data sets. This project facilitates the development of novel educational tools to enhance several current courses at University of Texas at Arlington. The PIs engage minority students and under-served populations in research activities to provide opportunities for exposure to cutting-edge scientific research. For further information see the web site at: http://ranger.uta.edu/~heng/NSF-DBI-1356628.html",NSF,University of Pittsburgh,PA,112577,1836866,heng.huang@pitt.edu,Heng,Huang,0,"Our research findings are highly relevant to the interdisciplinary research of machine learning and bioinformatics. The investigation of this project produces several important outcomes.

 

1. We developed new multi-dimensional visual descriptors integration algorithm for Drosophila gene expression patterns anatomical annotations. To facilitate the search and comparison of Drosophila gene expression patterns during Drosophila embryogenesis, it is highly desirable to annotate the tissue-level anatomical ontology terms for ISH images. In ISH image annotations, the image content representation is crucial to achieve satisfactory results. However, existing methods mainly focus on improving the classification algorithms and only using simple visual descriptor. We proposed a novel structured sparsity-inducing norms based feature learning model to integrate the multi-dimensional visual descriptors for Drosophila gene expression patterns annotations. The new mixed norms are designed to learn the importance of different features from both local and global point of views. We successfully integrated six widely used visual descriptors to annotate the Drosophila gene expression patterns from the lateral, dorsal, and ventral views. The empirical results show that the proposed new method can effectively integrate different visual descriptors, and consistently outperforms related methods using the concatenated visual descriptors.

 

2. We developed a novel multi-instance learning model with learning biological relevance for Drosophila ISH image annotations. We explored the multi-instance learning (MIL) model for annotating Drosophila ISH gene expression images. We proposed to directly assess the relevance between annotation terms and image panels by using the Class-to-Bag (C2B) distance for MIL. We apply our new approach to automatic gene expression pattern classification and annotation on the Drosophila melanogaster species. Our experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the new multi-instance learning method.

 

3. We conducted biological network inference via minimizing joint capped norms based matrix recovery model. We used the low-rank matrix recovery model to predict the new links in biological networks. We proposed a new robust matrix recovery model to address the above two challenges. The joint capped trace norm and capped L1-norm are used to tightly approximate the rank minimization and enhance the robustness to outliers. The evaluation experiments are performed on both synthetic data and network link prediction task. All empirical results show our new method outperforms the existing matrix recovery methods. We applied the new model to infer the incomplete gene interaction network from Drosophila gene expression images.

 

4. We also designed new deep learning model to infer the incomplete gene interaction network from Drosophila gene expression images. We used the emerging deep neural network embedding model to predict the new links in biological networks. Network embedding has attracted increasing attention in recent data mining research with many important applications. We proposed a novel self-paced network embedding method. Specifically, our method can adaptively capture the informativeness of each node based on the current training state, and sample negative context nodes in terms of their informativeness. The proposed self-paced sampling strategy can gradually select difficult negative context nodes with training process going on to learn better node representations. Moreover, to better capture the node informativeness for learning node representations, we extended our method to the generative adversarial network framework, which has the larger capacity to discover node informativeness. The extensive experiments have been conducted on the biological network datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

 

5. We addressed the fast image retrieval problem of Drosophila gene expression data via designing a new unsupervised deep generative adversarial hashing network method. Considering the labeled Drosophila images are lacking, we proposed a new deep unsupervised hashing function, called HashGAN, which efficiently obtains binary representation of input Drosophila images without any supervised pretraining. In our experiments, HashGAN outperforms the previous unsupervised hash functions in image retrieval and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various datasets.

 

6. We designed new bilevel distance metric learning model to enhance the Drosophila gene expression image annotations. We integrated both feature extraction and metric learning into one joint optimization framework and proposed a new bilevel distance metric learning model. Specifically, the lower level characterizes the intrinsic data structure using graph regularized sparse coefficients, while the upper level forces the data samples from the same class to be close to each other and pushes those from different classes far away. Experiments on Drosophila gene expression image data demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our method.

 

7. We released the machine learning software tools at the project website.

 

We published over 40 full-length papers related to this project in peer-reviewed conference proceedings and journals.

 

This project supported three Ph.D. students (one of them is female) at University of Pittsburgh and University of Texas at Arlington. All of them have graduated and one of them becomes a tenure-track assistant professor in Purdue University.

 

The research materials produced in this project are used in teaching several graduate courses at University of Texas at Arlington and University of Pittsburgh.

"The expansion of scientific knowledge is continually improving human understanding of the brain and other biological systems.  Increasingly, however, it is becoming clear that many of the capacities of the brain arise from rich and complex interactions among its many regions.  Conversely, disorders of the brain and body often arise from subtle deficits that gradually impair the coordinated function of these interacting neural and biological systems until, at last, they begin to collapse and major symptoms are expressed.  Because these networks of interactions are too complex to simply intuit, scientists construct computer models so that the work of many different scientific studies can be brought together and gradually constructed into a unified understanding of the intricate systems under study.  This leads to broader understandings of our complex brains and bodies that would not be possible without such quantitative models.  The goal of the Myriad project is to provide a software platform for biological modeling that makes it much easier to harness the power of modern parallel-processing computer systems.  A second goal is to implement a simulator that uses this platform to create detailed models of neurons and neural networks.   
 	 
Myriad is a compartmental simulator platform based on a shared-memory architecture and designed for computational speed based on NVIDIA GPU (CUDA) or parallel CPU execution.  Its transformative potential arises from its capacity to automatically parallelize any compartmental model, including those with dense analogue interactions that presently cannot be effectively parallelized, and without requiring the end user to write special, platform-specific parallelization code. Myriad's shared-memory design eschews message-passing, and utilizes a radically granular design approach that flattens hierarchically defined cellular models and can even break up individual isometric compartments by state variable.  Specifically, all models that can be represented as isometric, stateful nodes (compartments) connected by any number of arbitrary mechanisms can be simulated with a high degree of parallelism, automatically thread-scaled to the number of available threads and load-balanced with very fine granularity to maximize the utilization of available CPU or GPU cores.  Programmatically, end-user models are defined in a Python-based environment and converted into fully-specified C99 code (for CPU or GPU) via code generation techniques that are enhanced by a custom abstract syntax tree (AST) translator and, for NVIDIA GPUs, a custom object specification for CUDA enabling fully on-card execution.  The first applications of Myriad will be to simulate biophysically realistic computational models of neurons and networks.  Importantly, however, Myriad's generic compartmental solver will be able in principle to parallelize any model framework that can be represented as stateful nodes coupled pairwise by arbitrary mechanisms.  Accordingly, to extend Myriad into new scientific areas of study (e.g., gene regulatory networks, epidemiological models, host-virus interactions, ecological systems) will require development only at the higher Python-based software layer, presumably by experts in the relevant field.  Finally, as present parallelization strategies are only able to accelerate sparselycoupled models, computational modeling recently has been drawn towards that subset of scientific questions capable of being addressed by these methods.  The release of Myriad may reopen the full breadth of quantitative biological questions that can be effectively addressed by parallel simulation.  Updates on the Myriad project can be found at http://cplab.net/myriad.

Our initial efforts were to develop the simulator from scratch, but with the growing availability and performance of GPU-aware machine learning frameworks like PyTorch we shifted our strategy to make use of these developments.  Specifically, we wrote a model design framework for neuronal and neuromorphic networks, now called Sapicore, that is layered atop PyTorch but bypasses some of its higher-level methods (applicable to deep networks), instead adapting it to serve the dissimilar needs of biologically inspired neuronal and neuromorphic network modeling. 

The intellectual merit of this project centers around the need for tools that support the current generation of brain-inspired modeling.  This includes both computational neuroscience modeling, for purposes of better understanding the brain and its function, and neuromorphic modeling, a growing field within artificial intelligence that seeks to use brain-inspired networks in artificial systems.  Compared with the presently-dominant deep network methods, neuromorphic networks are more task-specific, learn more rapidly and flexibly, and when deployed on compatible hardware are much, much more energy-efficient.  However, they are constrained by our nascent understanding of how such decentralized networks can be most efficiently programmed for purpose.  Ascertaining the mechanisms of well-characterized brain networks, and adapting them for purpose in artificial systems, is an effective approach to this early-stage problem.  Our Sapicore framework serves this strategy. 

The broader impacts of this project include the open-source and freely-distributable software package Sapicore.  Sapicore is distributed via PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/sapicore/); its source code is freely available at http://github.com/cplab/sapicore, and programmer documentation is available at https://cplab.github.io/sapicore/index.html.

"The majority of cells in an organism contain the same DNA, and yet they are able to develop along different paths to achieve different functions and phenotypes. The cell type identity is defined, at least in part, by the specific regions of the genome that are transcribed from DNA to RNA.  Transcription is the basic cellular process that creates the RNA intermediate that either codes for proteins, mRNAs, or regulates other processes, producing various non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) like enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Both types of transcript cell differentiation paths or cellular responses to environmental influences. RNA polymerases are the enzymes that produce RNA transcripts, such as mRNAs and ncRNAs, and they exist in cells either as molecules that are maintain their association with the DNA template or are released being transported away from the DNA and acted on by other cellular machinery. One complication to analyzing the transcription process is that genes can overlap, so the presence of a polymerase and a nascent RNA transcript might indicate activity of either gene using current methodologies. Since RNA transcripts have a high propensity to fold into three dimensional shapes they that can affect the downstream processes, both sequence and shape of the nascent RNA are important characteristics of nascent transcripts still associated with DNA as well as the RNA transcripts that are released from the DNA. Only recently have high throughput nascent transcription assays become available; these allow researchers to assess the activity of cellular polymerases directly. This project seeks to develop an integrated analysis framework for nascent transcription data.  Critically, changes in the shapes or levels of transcripts provide information as to how mutations, or other perturbations, have affected an RNA polymerase's functional properties.  Understanding the detailed molecular basis of transcription is critical to many research areas including biochemistry, molecular biology and computational biology. As such, careful attention will be paid to the development of educational and computational resources to support of the larger community. 

The overall goal of this project is to develop of an integrated framework for the interpretation and analysis of nascent transcription. This project leverages a mathematical model of RNA polymerase II that, when fit to nascent transcription data, quantitatively characterizes not only the levels but also the shapes of all transcripts genome-wide.   Specifically, this project has 4 overarching goals, as follows:  Leverage patterns of differential nascent transcription to identify overlapping transcripts; detection of overlapping transcription at regulatory regions like enhancers may provide insight into how such ncRNAs function. Capture termination of transcription within a principled mathematical model of polymerase behavior; the algorithm developed here will inform on the conflicting hypotheses about how transcription termination occurs. Identify the impact of technical choices, such as protocol selection and sequencing depth, on the detection and characterization of transcripts, thereby recommending best practice in nascent transcription studies. Enable broader adoption of nascent transcription analysis through construction of an educational module that supports the use of these computational tools; the module will encompass the software, websites, and user documentation.  In summary, the research proposed here will provide an unprecedented perspective on differences in transcription characteristics at individual genes and how perturbations affect them.  By quantifying alterations in transcription at individual genes and their magnitude, the end result of this project will be an integrated framework for the interpretation of nascent transcription. Datasets and codebase links, with descriptions, may be found at http://dowell.colorado.edu/resources.html .

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Colorado at Boulder,CO,714871,1759949,robin.dowell@colorado.edu,Robin,Dowell,1,"The first readout of the genome is transcription.  Despite years of studies into expression, these studies have not focused on transcription -- as nearly all expression studies focus on RNA-seq, a steady state measure of RNA.   Steady state measures of RNA are influenced by not only transcription but also RNA decay rates.  Luckily, nascent transcription assays more directly assay true transcription, e.g. what RNA is actively associated with cellular RNA polymerases.   Thus, nascent transcription assays are proving to be critical to understanding transcriptional regulation.   

 

The goal of this project was to improve on our existing model of RNA polymerase II activity which we fit to nascent transcription data -- providing unprecedented readouts on the activity of RNA polymerase II in response to cellular perturbations.   For this work we focused on three key aspects of nascent transcription analysis: (1) improving the model to capture and characterize RNA polymerase II termination; (2) identify the impact of protocol selection, sequencing depth, normalization, and analysis tool selection on the identification of transcribed regulatory elements (also known as enhancer associated RNAs); and (3) develop a series of educational modules and associated resources to simplify nascent transcription analysis.  We also examined the possibility of using a large repository of nascent transcription assays to identify sites of same strand overlapping transcription within the underlying population of cells.

 

Intellectual Merit

Improvements to the RNA polymerase II mathematical models were ongoing throughout the duration of the grant.  We both improved method of using our existing model (no termination, the Tfit model) on a variety of datasets and developed an improved mathematical model for RNA polymerase II activity that includes a model for termination (LIET).   Testing and deployment of these models were used in studies of TFIIH and TFIID, fundamental components of RNA polymerase II.   Additionally, the improved models were instrumental in understanding how perturbations (growth conditions, drug exposure, differentiation, condition changes) alter upstream regulatory proteins (transcription factors). 

 

Additionally, we build a large cohesive repository of published nascent transcription data that was leveraged for two purposes: (a) to assess the impact of various experimental choices on transcribed regulatory element (TRE) detection and (b) to determine best practices in nascent transcription analysis.  Using the repository, we determined that several protocol specific variations in individual TREs exist.  We also compared several methods of TRE detection and developed improved analysis pipelines (Nextflow) that leverage the best practices for these methods.   Finally, we have explored new methods of normalization within and across nascent transcription data sets.   A website supporting the repository is being actively developed.

 

Broader Impacts

Our broader impacts focused on making nascent transcription analysis easier for scientists which we accomplished through a combination of activities.  First, we improved the documentation (both programmer and user) for our nascent transcription analysis tools (Tfit, FStitch, and TFEA).   We also now provide Docker instances for these algorithms.  Additionally, we have developed Nextflow pipelines to assist in both the upstream (quality control and mapping) and typical analysis steps (Tfit, others).   Second, we coupled these technical improvements with a ""best practices"" paper to be published in Methods in Enzymology.  Third, we developed a hands-on workshop oriented educational module that we incorporated into our two-week summer workshop on short read sequence analysis.

"Humans differ from other primates in their use of extensive allomaternal care (AMC), where someone other than the mother cares for an infant. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate how differences in early exposure to multiple caregivers influence a human infant's early communicative and cognitive development. The researchers hypothesize that AMC plays a significant role in shaping communicative and cognitive development by providing a rich and varied learning environment. Identifying how exposure to AMC may influence cognitive and communicative developmental trajectories will advance our understanding of why extensive AMC developed and was maintained in the human species. This project will support training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students in STEM research, and a new partnership between the University of Arizona's School of Anthropology and the Frances McClelland Institute for Children, Youth, and Families. The outcomes of this research may also inform educational programs to support communicative and cognitive development. To share their findings with the public, the researchers will generate a website and visit local mothers' support groups.

AMC is known to supplement an infant's intense energy needs through nutritional provisioning, but previous research has not fully investigated whether allomaternal care benefits infants in other ways. This research enhances traditional perceptions of AMC by hypothesizing that children gain important communicative and cognitive benefits in addition to nutritional support when they receive frequent allomaternal care during early development. The research represents an interdisciplinary, holistic approach to exploring the potential effects of AMC on early brain development before the age of two. Using a novel combination of interdisciplinary methods, including questionnaires, daily diaries, interviews, laboratory tasks, and clinical cognitive measures, this project will examine how care impacts developmental outcomes in young children. Participants will include infants aged 13 to 18 months and their mothers. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether AMC improves early developmental outcomes, such that infants exposed to high levels of AMC develop a more extensive set of communicative and cognitive skills at a younger age than infants exposed to low levels of AMC.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Arizona,AZ,19671,1752542,ilpike@email.arizona.edu,Ivy,Pike,1,"The researchers investigated how differences in the early caregiving environment impact developmental outcomes in infants between 13-18 months old. Anthropologists have been interested in understanding why humans, unlike our closest living nonhuman primate relatives, exhibit such extensive use of cooperative care to help raise their offspring. This cooperative care is generally referred to as allomaternal care (AMC), which is simply care provided to infants from anyone other than the mother. Across cultures, humans are marked by their extensive use of AMC from both related family members and unrelated community members to help care for young children. AMC can occur in both formal (for example, childcare facilities and preschools) and informal settings (for example, at home with a nanny), although formal care has received much more attention during previous research. Little previous research has focused on the potential developmental benefits that infants may receive from interacting with increased numbers of caregivers throughout their day-to-day lives. In this project, the researchers aimed to test whether having more individuals around for developing infants to interact with improves their learning environment such that they experience improved communicative and cognitive outcomes for their age range. 

 

Because little research had previously focused on exploring how AMC, particularly in informal settings, might impact early learning outcomes in infants prior to the onset of speech, this research provides an interdisciplinary methodology for addressing this shortage. Complete data sets were collected from 111 mothers and their infants aged 13-18 months. Mothers completed a series of questionnaires, daily diaries, and interviews, while infants completed two in-lab assessments of their cognitive and communicative abilities. A Current Caregiver Support and Involvement Questionnaire, Daily Diary template, and Past Allocare interview template were developed for this project to gather information about current and past AMC exposure experienced by each infant. These measures will be able to be modified for future projects to obtain similar measurements of AMC exposure in more diverse populations, and will be published as part of a methods paper in the near future. To aid in the completion of this project, the researchers trained a team of six undergraduate students in the analysis of communicative and cognitive measures, and the management of data from a large-scale research project. The researchers also fostered a new interdepartmental partnership between the University of Arizona's School of Anthropology and the Frances McClelland Institute for Children, Youth, and Families. 

 

Results of this project suggest that informal AMC, particularly from highly involved related individuals and individuals residing in the home, shapes early development such that infants exhibit higher scores on measures of cognitive skill and higher frequencies of communicative behaviors when exposed to more informal AMC from these individuals. Notably, the results suggest that informal care may play an important role above and beyond any care experienced in formal settings, as infants in this age range did not vary in their cognitive or communicative outcomes based on their attendance in formal care settings. At present, results from this project have been produced as three manuscripts, which have been submitted to peer-reviewed journals, as well as the Co-PI's dissertation, which can be accessed through the University of Arizona. A web-page is currently under development to educate the public about the potential impact that care from others may have on early child development. Future research will help us to better understand these potential relationships, such that later policy suggestions may be possible which aim to improve the development of early communicative and cognitive skills in children before the start of schooling.

"For our human ancestors, a shift toward earlier age at weaning may have contributed to higher reproductive success and population growth. However, the evolutionary context of this adaptive shift is not fully understood, in part because of methodological constraints in obtaining evidence of weaning from the fossil record. This doctoral dissertation project will analyze chemical signatures preserved in the teeth of wild mountain gorillas to determine how those signatures may be related to weaning and socioecological factors. Findings from this project could then serve as a foundation for applying this approach to the human fossil record.  This project will include scientific training and mentorship of students, including individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  It will also bolster research collaborations, support public science outreach and education, and inform ongoing primate conservation efforts.  

The investigators will test a developing method for reconstructing the timing of early-life dietary transitions from the distribution of calcium-normalized strontium and barium intensities in teeth, and to investigate weaning age variation within a single well-documented wild population of Virunga mountain gorillas from Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda. The chemical signature of mountain gorilla food resources will be characterized in order to provide a context for interpreting variation in enamel and dentine barium and strontium intensities. Estimated weaned age from trace element analysis will then be compared to longitudinal records on wild mountain gorilla diet and suckling. The following questions will be addressed: 1) How well do trace element distributions in teeth correspond to behavioral observations of suckling and other metrics for determining weaning age (e.g., interbirth interval)? and 2) How does the weaning chemical signature vary within a wild mountain gorilla population? The ability to partner behavioral and chemical data from individuals in this population represents a unique opportunity to test an emerging methodology for recovering relatively high resolution evidence of weaning in the human fossil record.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,George Washington University,DC,20444,1751608,mcfarlin@gwu.edu,Shannon,McFarlin,1,"All mammals face the same reproductive dilemma during the weaning process: lengthen the duration of lactation to decrease the risk of infant mortality or shorten the period of offspring nutritional dependence so that mothers may invest in future reproduction. Weaning has a critical influence on primate social interactions and reproductive strategies. Lactation is the most energetically costly period of maternal investment because mothers must support the nutritional requirements of both themselves and their growing offspring. The age at weaning is therefore considered a key developmental landmark, indicating the point at which an energetic compromise between the mother and infant is reached. Modern humans have previously been described as having an accelerated weaning process compared to the great apes, our closest living relatives. Since weaning age and lactation duration are strongly correlated with inter-birth interval, an early age at weaning is also an important factor contributing to increased human fertility. Increasing nutrition quality or alloparental care through the human lineage may explain a comparatively early weaned age in modern humans, but the point at which this shift began to occur is poorly understood due to a lack of direct evidence of weaning age in the fossil record. The purpose of this research project was to provide foundational baseline chemistry to improve methods for reconstructing the timing of early life-dietary transitions using the trace element signature in teeth.

The Virunga mountain gorilla skeletal collection offers the unique opportunity to chemically analyze dental samples from our closest living relatives, specifically from wild great ape individuals with long-term dietary histories within a population that has documented weaning variation. Behavioral observations suggest that this population also weans infants at younger ages compared to western gorillas and other great ape species and that weaning age is significantly earlier in one-male versus multi-male groups, proposedly a strategy to reduce infanticide risk. Trace element analysis has the resolution necessary to investigate this hypothesis and validate previous observational studies on weaning behavior and maternal investment. Furthermore, since this population is represented by a large skeletal collection with associated behavioral data, it has the potential to provide a well-tested framework for investigating weaning in both extinct species and historical specimens. However, establishing a baseline chemical signature of food resources is crucial for understanding chemical variation in dental tissues. This project sampled and analyzed gorilla plant foods and breast milk to provide a context for interpreting variability in trace element intensities in teeth. Captive longitudinal milk samples from four individuals were collected every month, from one month to two years postpartum from three zoos (National Zoological Park in Washington, DC, Cincinnati Zoo, and Zoo Atlanta). Additional samples from two Zoo Atlanta gorilla mothers range through four years postpartum. Comprehensive solid food collection was completed through cooperation with the Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda.

Results show that Strontium (Sr) and Barium (Ba), the two elements most important for understanding hard tissue chemical patterns in teeth, vary over altitude, along with other trace elements (Potassium, Calcium, and Zinc). Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, and Zinc also show significant variation between different plant parts. Regarding breast milk, a statistical analysis reveals that Potassium varies most consistently over lactation duration. When all mothers are pooled together, Calcium, Sodium, Potassium, Phosoprus, Zinc and Sulfur significantly vary through the postpartum period. Exploratory statistical analyses (Principal Component Analyses) suggest that the age of the infant (years post-partum) is an important factor in the trace element composition of gorilla breast milk. When comparing the trace element signature of plants to breast milk, solid foods were significantly lower in Ba, Sr, and Ca concentrations. These results suggest that biopurification (the differential movement of elements through ""biological filters""), bioavailability, and trace element concentrations may all play a role in the observed signature in hard tissues, having important implications for retrospective studies of weaning.

"The hormone testosterone (T) occurs in females as well as males, and there is growing interest in understanding the role of T in female reproductive behavioral biology. This doctoral dissertation project investigates relationships between T and maternal behaviors in free-ranging monkeys. The study of T in relation to motherhood in these non-human primates will contribute to the literature on the hormonal mechanisms of parenting, and provide comparative data for understanding the development of human-like parenting behavior during primate and hominin evolution. The project will facilitate training in STEM fields for undergraduates and graduates, including women from underserved and underrepresented backgrounds. This project will also support research collaborations and public science outreach about human and primate biology and evolution.

This project will investigate the role of T in regulation of maternal care away from the current offspring towards future reproduction, and displays of aggression to other group members who can potentially harm offspring ('maternal aggression'). The investigators will collect longitudinal data on behaviors and physiology from 49 Cayo Santiago rhesus macaque mothers during their first 3 months postpartum, when maternal care steeply decreases in preparation for the reproductive transition to the next offspring, and when maternal aggression towards others is heightened. Advances in field endocrinology, including the measurement of fecal hormone metabolites, will enable the continuous tracking of physiology along with a rich suite of behaviors and provide new methods for future studies. Comparative data from living non-human primates are valuable for investigating the evolutionary origins of human behavior. The project will therefore contribute to nascent efforts to expand the study of T across taxa and sexes, and to enhance our understanding of how parental care evolved in primates and early humans.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,New York University,NY,9450,1751889,jhigham@nyu.edu,James,Higham,1,"Project and outcomes 

Despite studies of the relationships between testosterone (T) and parenthood in male vertebrates, these relationships are relatively unexplored for female vertebrates. The gap in existing studies is especially true among non-avian taxa including primates, the order to which humans belong.

Recent evidence has begun to suggest that T may influence parental behavior in women, as it does in men, by modulating: 1) trade-offs in caretaking effort; and 2) motivation to display aggression towards others to protect offspring. As yet, no studies to date have examined the role of T in female reproductive behaviors, using direct measures of behaviors in relation to individual variation in T concentrations, in any free-ranging primates.

The present project sought to complement the growing literature on the role of T in motherhood, by contributing comparative data from free-ranging rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) on Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico. Behavioral and physiological data were collected from 49 mothers during their first 3 months postpartum. The species has long been studied to address the scope and sources of variation in maternal behavior, and studies have suggested that such variation may be in part explained by trade-offs between current and future reproduction during the birth season. For example, maternal rejection during the early postpartum period is associated with an increased chance of next conception. Early postpartum is also when rhesus macaque females display heightened aggression relative to any other reproductive stages, usually in response to rough and occasionally even fatal handling of infants by other females.

To track T concentrations non-invasively along with a rich suite of behaviors, this project took advantage of advances in field endocrinology including the measurement of fecal hormone metabolites. T concentrations in fecal samples were measured after validating a method for measuring androgen metabolites in captive rhesus macaque females. The injection of T in 2 captive rhesus macaque females resulted in increased circulating concentration of T and dehydrotestosterone (DHT), the 2 most potent androgens, and this change was reflected in the fecal measurements of DHT, androstenediol, and epicholanolone quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

Using the behavioral and physiological data, we tested the following hypotheses and predictions:

H1. Postpartum T mediates reproductive trade-offs in female rhesus macaques.

Prediction 1.1. Larger increases in T concentrations predict a shorter time to next conception.

Prediction 1.2. Larger increases in T concentrations predict reduced maternal care in current offspring.

H2. Postpartum T mediates the expression of maternal aggression in female rhesus macaques.

Prediction 2. Larger increases in T concentrations predict higher maternal aggression.

We found that females with lower average concentrations of both hormones were more likely to reproduce the following year. Both T and estrogen (E) declined within individuals during the early postpartum period, and the decline was slower in mothers who reproduced again in the next breeding year. Maternal care, quantified as time spent in ventro-ventral contact with the current offspring, was lower in mothers who reproduced again in the next breeding year. Within individual mothers, lower maternal care was correlated with increased E but not T concentrations. These findings suggest that early postpartum hormones and behavior elucidate mechanisms of reproductive trade-offs in female primates.

Dissemination

The above-described NSF-funded component was part of a wider dissertation consisting of three results chapters in the doctoral thesis of Co-PI submitted to New York University and successful defended and awarded in 2019. The results of the NSF-funded component have been written up as one of the chapters This chapter is now being prepared for publication in peer-reviewed academic journal. One of the other chapters in the dissertation was published in 2019 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Impacts

This research has enhanced our theoretical understanding of the role of T in life-history evolution, and contributed to generating the comparative data necessary for assessing the proximate mechanisms underlying the allocation of parental care. The findings from the validation experiment study will contribute to other disciplines including the general comparative endocrinology literature. In terms of broader impacts, this project has also created opportunities for training undergraduates in their early career stage in biology. On Cayo Santiago, the Co-PI recruited undergraduates (Puerto Rican, American) and trained them in skills for data collection from free-ranging animals. The project also helped the graduate student Co-PI to strengthen her skills in a broad range of research methods, including field data collection, hormone analysis, conducting experiment on captive monkeys, and analyzing different types of data with statistical models The images and videos collected during the fieldwork on Cayo Santiago will be used to develop a curriculum to introduce children to topics in biological anthropology. For example, in the spring 2019, The Co-PI has participated as a guest speaker in a STEM day event at a local school in Cambridge, U.K, and introduced the field of evolutionary anthropology to pupils in grades 9-12.

"In closely related animal species, differences in patterns of growth and development are often responsible for differences in adult anatomy. This doctoral dissertation project will study cranial anatomy in a number of primate species, taking into account trajectories of growth and development, and use those data to reconstruct the growth and development trajectories of ancestral species. The project will advance knowledge about primate adaptation and life history, and will also generate novel shape measurement tools for studying growth, development and anatomy that will be useful across a number of biological disciplines. Undergraduate students will participate in the processing and analysis of shape measurements, thereby teaching them technical skills in geometric morphometrics, mathematics, and statistical analysis. The project will also support public science outreach activities to share these biological concepts and methodological advances with a broader audience. 

The objective of this investigation is to examine how evolution has shaped craniofacial growth and development to produce the morphological diversity observed in catarrhines. Geometric morphometric methods will be used to measure an ontogenetic cranial series of 26 extant catarrhine species, from which trajectories of ontogenetic shape change will be calculated. To address ancestral morphologies, this project will reconstruct the cranial ontogenetic trajectory of the last common ancestor (LCA) of all extant catarrhines, as well as those of the LCA of cercopithecoids, hominoids, and hominins, allowing for a comparison of ancestral trajectories with those of extant taxa. As adult morphologies are largely the product of patterns of growth and development, these ancestral ontogenetic trajectories will be used to make determinations about the cranial shapes of adult catarrhine ancestors. This project will also address the role of cranial size in the production of adult morphologies through an evaluation of the hypothesis of size as a 'line of least evolutionary resistance,' whereby size changes may be a first step in adaptation and diversification, with size responding more quickly than shape to environmental change. Using the latest advances in phylogenetic comparative methods, this hypothesis will be tested through direct comparisons of vectors of ontogenetic shape change in the catarrhine skull, and by examining the catarrhine phylogeny for rate shifts in the evolution of cranial size and in cranial size-shape relationships.

The aims of this dissertation project necessitated a balance of a large number of species from multiple age groups, requiring a targeted approach of visiting multiple museums with large enough sample sizes. From these museums, a total of 1,397 specimens from 31 species of primates were collected, which exceeded the projected collection goal by ~400 specimens. After the data were collected, they needed to be processed so that they would be suitable for analysis. Undergraduate students were incorporated in this data processing, which taught them technical skills in data management of large datasets, mathematics, and statistical software. The collection and analysis of these data resulted in the successful completion of a doctoral dissertation and the awarding of a Ph.D. degree in biological anthropology.

            This project advances our understanding of primate evolution, and the role of growth and development in producing cranial shape differences among species. One of the key findings of this research was the falsification of a long held hypothesis that differences in skull shape between closely related primate species are due mostly to differences in body size. The large sample collected with these funds was used to demonstrate that this interpretation is too simplistic, and that natural selection on cranial shapes themselves (rather than on body size alone) is likely to be shaping the cranial anatomy of humans and their closest relatives. This research has also demonstrated that adult cranial shape is not solely determined from the cranial shapes of juveniles, that is, the pattern in which the cranium develops plays a crucial role in the production of adult cranial shapes. This has important implications for future studies of primate evolution because it demonstrates that the analysis of shape changes associated with growth and development can provide evidence for how differences in adult cranial shapes are accomplished. These results have been presented at national conferences (the American Association of Physical Anthropologists annual meetings), and are currently being prepared for publication in order to disseminate these results more widely. Once this investigation is published (projected submission for publication date: July, 2019), the cranial data will be made available to researchers who request them, and shared on PRIMO, the NYCEP Primate Morphology database (http://www.nycep.org/primo), to make them widely available (anticipated date of upload to PRIMO: late 2019). Additional publications are also in preparation, which will use the novel shape measurement tools for studying growth that were developed for this project in order to identify the characteristics of ancestral primate skull shape. This will further our understanding of the processes responsible for the evolution of the primate skull.

"Age-at-death estimation is central to bioarchaeological and forensic research, for reconstructing past population demographics and for narrowing down the identity of individuals from their unidentified remains. Recent advances in genetics have led to the identification of DNA methylation markers that change with age and could be used in new methods of age prediction, but generally using tissue types that are not always available in archaeological and forensic contexts. In this doctoral dissertation project, samples of human bone across a range of known ages will be analyzed to determine regions of the genome that change most reliably with age. These data will be used to develop a method of predicting an individual's age from their bones, which may show different patterns of methylation compared with other tissue types. The protocol and algorithms used in this project will be made freely available online, and the project will support graduate and undergraduate training and research in a STEM discipline.

While age-associated changes in DNA methylation are well known in the field of epigenetics, most research conducted so far has been in blood and saliva tissues that can be easily obtained from living individuals. DNA methylation patterns are known to differ significantly between tissue types, and epigenetic age prediction models developed for a particular tissue type cannot be automatically applied to another. Therefore, in order to extend the applicability of DNA methylation-based age prediction to forensic contexts, more research on specific forensically relevant tissues is necessary. In this project, the researchers will first generate a genome-wide DNA methylation dataset from human bone collected through a body donation program. DNA will be extracted from these bone samples and their DNA methylation levels will be measured at over 850,000 sites across the genome using a commercially available array. This dataset will be analyzed statistically to identify specific regions of the genome that vary in a strong, predictable manner with age. The DNA methylation patterns at these regions will be used to develop a statistical model that can accurately estimate chronological age. Finally, a protocol to target and measure methylation levels at only these highly age-associated genomic regions will be developed, which will allow the age estimation method to be applied at a much lower cost

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,SUNY at Stony Brook,NY,31514,1753951,brenna.henn@stonybrook.edu,Brenna,Henn,1,"The goal of this project was to develop a new method of estimating age at death from skeletal remains by using DNA extracted from bone. Most methods currently employed by forensic scientists rely on specific physical features of the bones or teeth, which indicate how far along the individual was in their development in order to estimate how old they were when they died. However, this class of methods can be difficult to apply consistently, and they tend to be less useful for estimating adult age precisely, since most skeletal development processes are complete by early adulthood. In this project, we explored a molecular method of estimating human age based on DNA methylation. DNA methylation is a chemical modification to the DNA structure that has been shown to exhibit certain characteristic patterns of change with age.

We extracted DNA from bone samples of 42 different deceased people of known age and measured DNA methylation at over 800,000 different sites across the entire genome. Our samples were drawn from two different contexts; the first were recently deceased individuals who donated their bodies to Stony Brook University, SUNY for anatomy courses, while the second were individuals who has donated their bodies to the Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State (FACTS) for forensic research, and were exposed to natural processes of degradation outdoors for 2-3 years. While we successfully obtained high quality DNA methylation from the Stony Brook University donations, we found that the outdoor forensic specimens were highly degraded and levels of DNA methylation could not be reliably measured. We combined our new dataset with publicly available bone methylation data, and used this information to develop a statistical model to estimate age. Overall, the individuals we studied ranged in age from 49 to 112 years. We found that using measures of DNA methylation from 50 distinct regions of the genome, we could estimate individual age within 8.8 years.

Previous research has developed age estimation models using DNA methylation for other tissues, such as blood, saliva, and brain, but very little attention had been paid to tissues like bone that can survive intact well after an individual has passed away. Compared to a previously published DNA methylation-based age prediction method, we demonstrate that even more accurate estimates of chronological age can be generated for human bone from 7-fold fewer genomic sites. The results of our project demonstrate that DNA methylation-based age estimation is possible for bone. With a statistical model such as the one we developed, these techniques coudl be applied to a variety of important real-world cases. For example, forensics departments all over the country are routinely tasked with identifying deceased persons based on skeletal remains. With more accurate methods, such as that developed through this project, the process of investigating missing persons cases is likely to become more streamlined and are more successful. The post-mortem DNA damage in our forensic samples does, however, highlight several practical considerations related to the application of any method that relies on good-quality DNA, including preservation and the type of bone chosen.

"Primates are distinguished from other mammals by their grasping hands and feet, and nails instead of claws. These anatomical features are thought to have helped the earliest primates to navigate thin terminal branches of trees. However, the lack of claws may also have led to different locomotor (movement) behaviors for navigating large trees that could not be grasped. This doctoral dissertation project will study different primate and non-primate mammalian species to better understand locomotor changes with age, and in response to changing environments. These findings can help elucidate broader patterns of interaction between locomotor evolution and life history in the primate lineage. This project will support student training and mentoring at the K-12 through graduate levels. Data generated by this project will be used in an outreach lesson plan demonstrating how animal motion can be understood as simple machines for a STEM education program for elementary to middle school age girls in Durham, NC through Duke University, and for all ages attending annual public outreach days at the Duke Lemur Center.  
  
The goal of this project is to understand primate locomotor tradeoffs between selection for or maintenance of morphological specialization for movement in specific places (e.g. thin branches), while still needing to move through and between more general (e.g. trees, the ground) environments. Through comparative analysis of descending locomotion and mechanics in eight primate species, and three non-primate mammals, this project examines behavioral shifts in response to changing environmental conditions by experimentally modifying support orientation and size. Animals are filmed crossing increasingly steep and thick supports, and it is predicted that primates will abandon headfirst walking in favor of alternative behaviors, such as leaping, sliding, and rear-first descending in response to the biomechanical challenges of these supports, while non-primate mammals will continue to move headfirst with the aid of their claws. The comparative sample features species from a wide range of body sizes (0.06 to 3.5 kg), limb proportions, and behavioral specializations. Within each species, individuals of different ages are compared to assess how aging affects arboreal locomotion, which would have been a key challenge incurred during the evolution of increasingly long lifespans in the primate lineage.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Duke University,NC,24380,1751686,doug.boyer@duke.edu,Douglas,Boyer,1,"To be successful in an arboreal environment, animals must be able to safely maneuver and navigate upon highly compliant branches and a diverse array of support orientations. Most mammals possess claws that allow them cling to large supports, but primates, the group that includes humans, lack claws and instead must grasp thinner branches in order to safely travel. This project addressed the question of how primates vary in their descending ability across a range of body masses and skeletal proportions, and then asked what this might tell us about our earliest ancestors and their specialization to terminal branch arboreal environments.  

Nine species of strepsirrhine primates were video recorded moving across an experimental structure in which support orientation and diameter were varied at the Duke Lemur Center (Durham, NC). Primates weighing less than 1 kg had no problems descending all supports headfirst, while larger primates (1-4.5 kg) began to utilize increasing amounts of rear first descents as supports reached inclinations of 45&deg;-60&deg;. Using anatomical variables associated with each animal such as mass and skeletal proportions, Bayesian multilevel statistical models were created and used to identify the relative effects of these features to explain variation in locomotor behavior. The model was then applied to the fossil record to predict behavioral profiles for extinct primates and simulated primate ancestors to understand the hypothetical limitations early primates might have faced when transitioning from claws to nails.

After these broad scale patterns of descent were documented, a comparative study of the biomechanics of headfirst descent was conducted to recognize general and species-specific kinematic adjustments to travel on very steep supports. General patterns included increasing the amount of contact time of the limbs during the stride cycle and favoring gaits that allowed primates to keep a grasping foot on the support above the center of mass, likely to counteract forward pitch and reduce fall risk, while placing the braking forelimbs upon the support. These gaits also tended to increase the relative proportion of time in the stride cycle in which the body was supported by 3 and 4 feet at a time when compared to horizontal travel. These results, both at the scale of behavioral differences &ndash; e.g. headfirst and rear first descent &ndash; and kinematic adjustments suggest that locomotor plasticity might be a key aspect of success for primates living in and traveling through arboreal environments.  

This funding contributed to the successful training and completion of a Doctor of Philosophy degree for the co-PI, Bernadette Perchalski. The full results of this study are included in her dissertation, which is available in the ProQuest Dissertation and Theses database. These results have been shared at the American Association of Physical Anthropology meetings (2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020) and are in preparation as manuscripts or submitted to peer reviewed journals at the time of this report. In addition to sharing this research with the scientific community, this project was used to create an educational activity shared at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences on public outreach days by the Co-PI. This activity was aimed at elementary and middle school age children who were tasked with linking animal adaptations (specifically claws, grasping hands, and gecko-like adhesion) to various surfaces that these animals are specialized for while also covering the basic mechanics of pitch and roll for young learners.

"Human males and females exhibit differences in the prevalence of certain neurological disorders, which may be influenced by differences in neuroanatomy and brain gene expression. This doctoral dissertation project uses a non-human primate model to investigate male and female variation in brain anatomy and gene expression and to consider selective pressures that may have led to this variation. This fundamental research has the potential to inform developing treatments for neurobehavioral disorders in humans, particularly given that the non-human primate model is likely to be more relevant than murine models for understanding social behavior. Funding for this project will support the research of a minority female graduate student who will also serve as an educator and mentor. She will conduct science outreach through her participation in multiple after-school and summer programs, all of which offer mentorship and/or research experience to underrepresented and underserved students interested in science. 

Sexual selection is an evolutionary process whereby certain traits are under selective pressure related to competition over access to mates or selection of preferred mates. These mechanisms differ across species, and have resulted in sex differences in non-neurological traits (e.g. body size, hair color). Limited evidence suggests that sexual selection may also influence brain evolution and that these selective pressures may have been particularly strong on the brain during human evolution. The researchers will collect new neurobiological data in female and male primate brains to characterize species-specific sex differences in brain region volumes, sulcal morphology, and gene expression using phylogenetic comparative methods and differential expression analyses. They will then test for correlates of within-species variation in brain sex differences using two large datasets, including chimpanzee sulcal morphology and rhesus macaque brain gene expression, which also contain matching behavioral data.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,New York University,NY,25071,1752393,jhigham@nyu.edu,James,Higham,1,"Neurological and psychiatric disorders affect up to 1.5 billion people worldwide. There are striking sex differences in the prevalence of certain disorders (e.g. autism), which are likely driven by differences in neuroanatomy and brain gene expression. Accordingly, it is imperative that we characterize neurological sex differences present in nonhuman animal models used for biomedical research. Most neuroscientific research has been carried out on rodents; however, there are areas of the primate brain that are less developed or absent in rodents. Nonhuman primates are, therefore, likely to be better models of human neurological disorders. Rhesus macaques are the most widely used nonhuman primate model; however, most research has been conducted on males only. Consequently, sex differences in brain gene expression have yet to be been characterized in this species.

To fill in this gap in our knowledge, the researchers collected new gene expression data from 15 brain regions across 36 rhesus macaques (18M/18F) in order to examine patterns of sex-biased gene expression (Study 1). This was accomplished using established frozen tissue dissection and RNA extraction/quantification methods. Given that this species is closely related to humans and exhibits similar neuroanatomy, they predicted that rhesus macaques would share the following characteristics with humans: P1) the anterior cingulate cortex, a region associated with social valuation and conflict processing, would exhibit the most sex-biased genes; P2) genes that are expressed at relatively higher levels in male brains (i.e. male-biased genes) would be enriched for genes related to autism. Their preliminary differential expression and enrichment analyses confirm these predictions.

In addition, the potential evolutionary selective pressures that led to sex differences in the brain remain unknown. This is largely due to a shortage of studies that: 1) examine these differences in our closest living relatives, nonhuman primates; and/or 2) place human brain sex differences in a comparative context. The researchers addressed this shortage by: 1) examining sex differences in chimpanzee brain structure variability (Study 2); and 2) comparing sex-biased gene expression in the brains of humans and rhesus macaques (Study 3). For Study 2, the surface areas of cortical sulci (i.e. folds) across a large sample of chimpanzees were obtained using MRI scans. The researchers predicted that male brains would show greater variation than those of females since human men are relatively more variable in terms of cognition and brain region volumes. The researchers confirmed their prediction using permutation tests of variance ratios. This is the first study to demonstrate this pattern in a nonhuman species. For Study 3, the researchers obtained gene expression data across 16 brain regions in humans and rhesus macaques and performed differential expression analyses. They predicted human brains would exhibit more sex differences than rhesus macaque brains since: 1) sexual selection (a process by which certain traits are selected for because individuals with those traits have more offspring than those who do not) has been particularly strong on the brain during human evolution since language may allow more direct sexual selection on mental abilities; and 2) human brain development is very sensitive to the surrounding environment, so any neurobiological sex differences in humans are likely to be enhanced by current systems of inequity in how girls and boys are treated throughout development. The researchers confirmed that human brains exhibit more sex-biased genes than those of rhesus macaques.

Funding for this project supported the research of a minority female graduate student beginning her scientific career, who will continue to serve as an educator and mentor. She has already disseminated this research through invited public talks at the Caveat Theater in NYC. She also teaches an afterschool science program once per week at underfunded school in Brooklyn, and mentors for the Diversity Undergraduate Research Incubator (DURI) at NYU, a full-time eight week summer program for undergraduate female students at NYU. She will continue outreach through her participation in after-school and summer programs, all of which offer mentorship and/or research experience to under-represented and underserved female students interested in science.

"Stress experienced by a mother during early, critical periods of her child's development can have negative impacts on the child's physiology. However, the factors that mediate these negative impacts are not fully understood. This doctoral dissertation project will use well-characterized samples of mothers and offspring to investigate relationships among external stressors, maternal responses to stress, sociocultural factors that impact the perception of stress, and offspring high body mass index in early childhood. This project will advance our knowledge about the complex interplay among human biological adaptation, culture, and environment, and will potentially inform public health strategies regarding early life obesity. The project will also support graduate student training and international research collaborations.

The primary objective of this study is to analyze the risks and protective factors that may mediate or moderate the development of early childhood obesity and to explore the lived experience of stress in a sample of New Zealand mothers. The research uses a biocultural mixed-methods approach. First, the researchers will use structural equation modeling to examine pathways among stress, potential risk and protective factors, and early childhood body mass index using a large (n=5,839) representative data set from New Zealand. The researchers will then employ qualitative methods with an ethnically-diverse sample of New Zealand mothers (n=70) to explore the lived experience of stress in this population. The findings from this project will contribute to our growing understanding of the biological consequences of stress in all human populations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,University of Colorado at Denver-Downtown Campus,CO,19903,1751287,David.Tracer@UCDenver.edu,David,Tracer,1,"Exposure to environmental stressors during development alters human biology. Importantly, stress experienced by mothers during both the pre- and post-natal periods of growth can have negative impacts on offspring development. Given the epidemic of childhood overweight and obesity, early childhood body mass index (BMI) is a useful outcome to explore the impacts of environmental exposures during critical periods of development as offspring weight and height are extremely sensitive to environmental influences. The primary objective of this study was to use mixed-methods to examine pathways between prenatal stress and early childhood obesity among New Zealand mothers.  The first aim was to use structural equation modeling to analyze factors that may mediate or moderate associations between early life stress and early childhood BMI. The Growing Up in New Zealand longitudinal study provided information on 5,839 pregnant women and their children to assess this aim. Risk behaviors, including the number of nutrition guidelines met during pregnancy and the length of exclusive breastfeeding, significantly mediated relationships between prenatal stress and early childhood BMI; physical activity levels during pregnancy did not. Protective factors, including family support, external support, neighborhood integration, household cohesiveness, and cultural identity were aggregated for path analyses. The aggregated variable did not significantly moderate the direct path between prenatal stress and early childhood BMI at 54-months in the full sample. However, path analysis models suggested that these pathways vary by ethnicity.

Focus groups and in-depth interviews (n=82) were conducted with a representative sample of mothers from New Zealand to better understand the lived experience of stress and variations among ethnic groups.  All participants were mothers living in high deprivation neighborhoods with at least one child under the age of five. An ethnically diverse sample of mothers participated; 22% of mothers mothers identified as European, 21% identified as Asian, 23% identified as Pacifika, 29% identified as M&#257;ori, and 5% identified as other. Although financial stress was the most commonly cited source of stress across all mothers, diverse sources of stress were shared and there were significant variations among ethnic groups. Overall, M&#257;ori mothers reported exposure to the highest unique number of stressors compared to European, Pacifika, and Asian mothers. When asked about pathways between stress and early childhood obesity, New Zealand mothers shared that stress most significantly impacts their diet and that increased stress results in forgetting to eat, eating junk food and sugar-sweetened beverages, eating takeaways, and less cooking at home. Stress also makes it more difficult to be active on a regular basis, breastfeed, and sleep. Mothers reported that support helped them cope with stress although the sources of support varied by ethnicity; M&#257;ori and Pacifika mothers said family support was most helpful, European mothers said social support outside of the family unit was most helpful, and Asian mothers said partner support was most helpful in effectively coping with stress.  Neighborhood integration and cohesiveness or connection to a community was also a prominent source of support mentioned by mothers. Cultural identity was supportive but also stressful and these associations varied by individual and ethnic group. Taken together, these mixed-methods findings imply significant variations in the lived experience of stress and associations with early childhood obesity between European, M&#257;ori, Pacifika, and Asian mothers in New Zealand.

This study has significant public health and anthropological implications. The findings contribute to our understanding of the origins of childhood obesity. The mechanisms explaining how external factors impact biology are complex. The current epidemic of child obesity is impacting communities on a global scale, and behavioral interventions are not always effective due to the complexity of risk and protective factors that influence a child?s predisposition to obesity. Addressing negative exposures to stress during early developmental periods may prove to be more effective than attempting to alter health behaviors and trajectories in adulthood.

These findings also highlight the influence of the sociocultural context on human health and development and demonstrates the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to better understand dimensions of maternal stress, protective factors that impact stress experiences, and associations with the development of early childhood obesity. Social support, neighborhood integration, household cohesiveness, and cultural identity may confer resilience differentially between ethnic groups. Further insight into variation of these factors within and between cultures may inform shared patterns of protective cultural resources across communities throughout New Zealand. Stress-reduction and obesity prevention interventions must be tailored to the cultural norms and values of the specific target audience to promote maternal and child resiliency.

"The 'gut microbiome' is the complex community of microorganisms that inhabits animal gastrointestinal tracts and performs functions vital to host survival. Most research on the gut microbiome has focused on human and rodent models. This doctoral dissertation project takes a broader, comparative perspective by examining gut microbiome characteristics in non-human primates, to better understand microbiome variation across species, diets, and habitats. Beyond providing new, relevant animal models for understanding human health, this multi-species research will provide fundamental knowledge about primate-microbiome relationships relative to host ecology and evolution, and will inform husbandry practices for improving the management of endangered species. The results of this study will be shared with the scientific community via publication in peer-reviewed journals, specific conservation organizations, such as the IUCN Primate Specialist Group, and the Duke Lemur Center, and with the general public via commitment to educational science outreach. The project will also provide training for undergraduate students in field and laboratory methods, bioinformatics and statistical analysis, and data dissemination.  

For leaf-eating primates, one critical role of the gut microbiome is to convert ingested plant fiber into essential nutrients. Indeed, upwards of 57% of daily energy demands in folivorous primates are met by microbially-synthesized compounds. Yet, our understanding of the influence of host ecology and evolution on the primate gut microbiome remains limited, as there is a paucity of available comparative data. To boost comparative power, the co-PI's dissertation research is focused on the structure and function of the gut microbiome in multiple lemur species that vary in relatedness, the proportion of foliage in their diets, the type of forest they inhabit, and their endangerment. The investigators will explore gut microbiomes in two wild populations of Coquerel's sifakas living in northwest Madagascar, and the captive population housed at the Duke Lemur Center in NC. Combining two methods of powerful genetic sequencing, that respectively determine microbial membership and metabolic function, this project address three specific aims: (1) a phylogenetic comparison across several wild primate species, (2) determination of normative gut microbiome variation across populations of a host species, and (3) investigation of the effects of captivity on sifaka gut microbiome. Ultimately, this study will improve understanding of the fragility of the folivore gut microbiome and offer insight into primate nutrition, with potential applications to primate husbandry and human healthcare.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Duke University,NC,24871,1749898,cdrea@duke.edu,Christine,Drea,1,"The research goal of the present project was to compare the gut microbiomes of Coquerel&prime;s sifaka lemurs living in two locations in the wild and in captivity. The gut microbiome is the complex community of bacteria and other microscopic organisms that inhabit animal gastrointestinal tracts. Gut microbes perform vital digestive functions for their hosts and contribute to animal health. Sifakas are critically endangered lemurs from Madagascar who eat a diet rich in leaves (and some fruit), and tend to suffer from fragile health in captivity. Gut microbes help render leaves nutritious to the lemurs, by breaking down tough plant fiber and toxins, and by synthesizing nutrients and vitamins. By comparing gut microbiomes across wild and captive sifakas, we can learn how much variation naturally exists between sifaka populations in the wild, and how captive conditions may disrupt the relationship between sifakas and their gut communities, and thereby contribute to health challenges. Such information can inform strategies for the care and management of captive lemur colonies, for example by helping us optimize the diets fed to captive lemurs, and can also inform our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological relationships between primates and their gut microbiota.

The methods for this project involved collecting fresh fecal samples during animal observation from sifakas living in the Anjajavy Protected Area and Ankarafantsika National Park in northwest Madagascar, and from those housed at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, NC. Once collected, bacterial DNA was extracted from the samples and submitted for genetic sequencing using two techniques. First, we sequenced a marker gene for bacterial species (the 16S rRNA gene), which provides information about what types of bacteria inhabit sifaka guts, and at what relative abundances. Second, we sequenced the bacterial metagenome, which provides information as to what functions those inhabiting microbes perform. The resulting sequences were analyzed using established bioinformatics and statistical pipelines.

The results of the project indicate that there is some natural variation in the gut microbiomes of wild sifakas living at different field sites, which provides key information about the flexibility and adaptability of primate gut microbiota. Nevertheless, the microbiomes of captive sifakas are vastly different when compared to those of their captive counterparts. Indeed, the gut microbiota of captive sifakas were lacking in many microbes that were commonly abundant in the wild sifakas&prime; guts, particularly those linked to fruit metabolism, and instead were enriched for microbes typically associated with fat, protein, and complex fiber metabolism. Moreover, the gut microbiota of captive sifakas had increased capacity for methane metabolism, but decreased capacity for vitamin B5 synthesis. Taken together, these results offer real clues as to how we can consider optimizing the diets fed to captive sifakas, for example by offering more fiber-rich fruits, but fewer leafy greens, nuts, and beans. Moreover, they point to vitamin B5 requirements as an area for future veterinarian research.

This project also included broader-impact goals in Madagascar and in North Carolina. While in Madagascar, PI Greene wanted to engage with the Malagasy scientific community, develop new collaborations with students and researchers, and provide training on field and laboratory based techniques. These goals were met. The project provided training for a handful of student assistants in field techniques, such as animal identification, sample collection and storage, and in laboratory techniques, such as pipetting and genomic DNA extraction. In collaboration with an integrative team from the Duke Lemur Center, Duke University, Association Vahatra, and the University of Antananarivo, Greene helped develop and co-led genetics workshops for Malagasy college and graduate students. The workshops provided background information, instruction, and hands-on experience to 25-60 students at a time, in the laboratory techniques needed to sequence marker genes from biological samples. 

Back in the United States, Greene worked with the Research, Education, and Communication departments at the Duke Lemur Center. The Duke Lemur Center&prime;s research interns were trained in field methods, including animal identification and fecal sampling. Greene led research-focused tours and gave lecture demonstrations for school and camp groups, as well as for the adult general public. Greene wrote blogs and posts for the Duke Lemur Center&prime;s social media, which is currently followed by 35,000 users.

"The population history of First Nations people cannot be fully understood without knowing the genetic effects of European colonization, including whether these effects differed for indigenous men versus women. In this doctoral dissertation project, the student co-PI will study a population of First Nations people through time by comparing DNA diversity of contemporary community members to those of their ancestors from archaeological sites. Using both maternal (mitochondrial) and paternal (Y-chromosome) DNA for modern and ancient samples will provide information on the genetic diversity and structure before and after European colonization and identify effects that differed for males and females. This project will support graduate student training and mentoring, including experience as teaching assistants for the genomic lab portion of the SING (Summer internship for INdigenous peoples in Genomics) workshop where indigenous peoples learn how to use genomics as a tool and form a network of indigenous scientists. Using a community based approach, this project completes research in a collaborative way with indigenous communities, resulting in more accurate information and enhanced scholarship. 

Researchers have speculated about the demographic effects of European colonization, the population genetic structure of Native Americans pre-contact, the amount of European admixture and the estimates of the number of indigenous Americans present pre-contact. It has been difficult to quantify these demographic changes because there are no published datasets with large numbers of ancient individuals and their descendants. In this project, mitochondrial and Y-chromosome DNA data will be combined with existing archaeological information and documented oral histories to infer the effects of European Colonization on males and females in the ancient Prince Rupert Harbour (PRH) population and modern descendants. The researchers hypothesize that the effects of European colonization will be greater for men than women because of differences in activity patterns and admixture.  The large sample size present in the PRH population, in addition to the long-term continual habitation in the coastal area, provides a unique dataset to use as comparative data for other researchers.

The ancient DNA data was compared to DNA data from present-day descendant individuals to learn about the biological impacts of European colonization on Indigenous peoples. A major outcome of the project is that overall, a major loss of DNA variation from the ancient community, prior to European contact, was identified compared to the present-day descendant community. Along with historical records, this is interpreted as a result of warfare and impacts of disease on Indigenous peoples as a result of European colonialism. In addition, Y-chromosomes identified as belonging to Indigenous males in the ancient community, prior to European contact, were either lost or replaced with Y-chromosomes belonging to males of European descent in the present-day Indigenous community. This is likely the result of European males replacing Indigenous males as a result of European colonialism in the genetic pool of the present-day Indigenous community.

"The skeletal anatomy of an animal species is generally related to its patterns of movement and behavior and to its habitat. Understanding the complex relationships between form, function, and environment is essential for reconstructing the behaviors and habitats of past species. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate how populations of wild mountain gorillas living in ecologically distinct habitats may differ in their patterns of movement (locomotor behavior). This information will help contextualize the observable skeletal variation in apes and inform our inferences about locomotion in fossil apes and humans. The project will involve interdisciplinary and international collaborations, broaden the participation of under-represented groups in STEM, and provide research mentorship to undergraduate students. The researchers will engage with the public on topics related to human evolution and our closest living relatives, the African apes.

Paleoanthropologists have long debated how our early ancestors moved, especially in terms of how they first began walking upright on two legs, and how much time they may have spent in the trees. While more fossils, and more species, have been added to the hominin family tree, there is still limited knowledge about how closely related species and populations may have differed in terms of habitats and locomotion. Data on the locomotion of living ape populations can advance our understanding of the form-function relationships between locomotor behavior and skeletal features, allowing more informed inferences from the ape and human fossil record. The researchers will investigate how the locomotor behavior of two populations of mountain gorillas differs, in terms of the frequency of key locomotor behaviors and limb and joint motions. The study will use traditional observational methods to quantify the relative frequency of different postural and locomotor behaviors, and place into context the frequency of locomotor behaviors (e.g., vertical climbing and below-branch suspension) in comparison to other great apes. The video-based motion analysis (kinematics) will implement new field-based methods for capturing motion data, providing some of the first 3D kinematic data on apes in their natural environment. Kinematic analysis will quantify the joint postures and movements used during locomotion, offering new quantitative data for interpreting the functional role of skeletal features often used to infer locomotor capabilities.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,George Washington University,DC,13167,1753963,almecija@gwu.edu,Sergio,Almecija,1,"Gorillas inhabit a diverse range of environments, from more open lowland forests in western Africa to high-altitude, montane forests in eastern Africa. The ecological variation between different populations also results in differences in fruit-eating, time spent in trees, and overall locomotor behavior. Mountain gorillas are generally considered terrestrial, as most of their food sources are from terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, compared to more arboreal western gorillas that have more fruit available in their environment. However, the best-known mountain gorillas are the Virunga population, made famous by the work of Dian Fossey. Another population of mountain gorillas, at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda, live only a few kilometers away, but in a somewhat lower-altitude environment with more fruit available than for the Virunga population. Understanding differences between these two populations of the same species will be important for understanding the relationships between morphology, behavior, and ecology among closely-related apes.

The major goals of this project were to (1) quantify the postural and locomotor behavior of Bwindi mountain gorillas, and (2) utilize novel field-based methods for collecting kinematic data on wild apes, for investigation of limb segment and joint motion during locomotion.

Part 1: The study of positional behavior, including posture and locomotion, was conducted on four groups of Bwindi mountain gorillas, including 44 individuals. The percentage of time spent in different postural and locomotor modes were calculated for each individual and compared across age-sex categories. Infants were the most active, using the highest rates of arm-hanging and other arboreal behaviors, with a shift toward greater frequencies of quadrupedal walking in older age-sex categories. The majority of adult locomotion consisted of quadrupedal walking, with adult-like levels of quadrupedal walking reached in subadults. This differs from the Virunga mountain gorillas, as previous study has shown that an adult-like locomotor patterns was attained earlier, by juvenility. Overall, frequencies of arboreal behaviors like vertical climbing and descent were greater for all age-sex categories at Bwindi compared to the Virungas, likely due to the greater amount of fruit-feeding at Bwindi. Since most morphological studies that include gorillas typically characterize mountain gorillas as highly terrestrial, based on the Virunga mountain gorillas, it is important that future studies take into account that Bwindi mountain gorillas do regularly spend time in trees.

Part 2: Studies of 3-D kinematics of ape locomotion have typically been conducted in more controlled lab or other captive settings; however, some apes- including mountain gorillas- are not available for study in captive settings. The ability to collect data in natural environments will provide access to animals that only exist in the wild, as well as the opportunity to analyze movement on a variety of natural substrates.

To implement novel field-based 3-D kinematic methods in the field, video data was collected at the mountain gorilla field site, using a portable multi-camera setup, to collect synchronized high-speed video. Using this video, we tested two methods to assess their potential for reliability and accuracy in the field: the first being a more traditional wand calibration, in which an object of known size is moved through the space of interest, and kinematic software can be used to transform this space into a 3-D coordinate system; the second utilizes photogrammetric techniques to reconstruct a 3-D point cloud of the animal and surrounding environment, termed ?videogrammetry?. Results thus far have shown that these field-based setups can provide reliable data for kinematic analysis, indicating that measures of error in the calibration methods can be as low as is generally accepted in laboratory-based motion capture studies. Kinematic data resulting from both methods are relatively consistent, though some joint angles may be more prone to error than others. A further validation study is in progress, comparing the field-based camera setup to the standard for laboratory-based motion capture, with video recorded simultaneously for the same trials and comparing calibrations and joint angles resulting from both methods. Despite some unavoidable limitations in field settings, these methods will provide researchers with an opportunity to collect 3-D kinematic data on apes in their natural environment, and will greatly expand the available comparative data quantifying ape locomotion.

This grant has contributed to the education of a doctoral student, who worked directly with researchers at a variety of international field sites and contributed to training and ongoing research collaborations. During this process, she also participated in a variety of outreach programs for public understanding of science and conservation education, and helped develop a facilitated cart with hands-on activities that will teach audiences about mountain gorillas, to be used in museum exhibit settings. Preliminary results were presented at annual meetings of the American Association of Biological Anthropology meetings, and continued publication of the work in peer-reviewed journals is in progress.

"Gene regulation affects when, where, and how much a gene is expressed in an organism. This doctoral dissertation project will study changes in DNA methylation (a chemical mark on DNA that influences gene expression levels) in different baboon species, to better understand how changes in DNA methylation affect gene expression, how DNA methylation has diverged between species, and the role of natural selection in this process. Differences in how particular genes are expressed are thought to be important in explaining many differences among primate species, including some traits that are unique to the human lineage. Novel data on gene regulation and expression can therefore help to advance knowledge about the development of our own species. The project will support student training and mentoring at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels, and the development and dissemination of interdisciplinary approaches using genomic methods that can be applied to a number of other fields of study.

This project will investigate the effects of genetic ancestry on DNA methylation by leveraging genetic admixture in 150 adult baboons from a wild baboon population in Kenya. Admixed individuals (baboons with ancestry from two distinct but closely related taxa) provide the opportunity to test how genetic variation from different ancestries influences DNA methylation when placed in a common environment. Furthermore, because the study population has been affected by both recent and historical admixture events, it can be used to test hypotheses about the legacy of archaic hominin admixture with modern humans. Finally, this project will ask whether between-species differences in DNA methylation translate to changes in gene expression, testing an important assumption of models that link DNA methylation to trait variation.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",NSF,Duke University,NC,31793,1751783,jt5@duke.edu,Jenny,Tung,1,"SUMMARY AND INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Changes in the level, location, and timing of gene activity?collectively known as gene regulation?are thought to be important in explaining the evolution of differences between primate species. This hypothesis has been supported by comparisons between distantly related primates, but may also contribute to differences between closely related groups, such as humans and our extinct close relatives, the Neanderthals. However, comparisons involving humans are limited because Neanderthals and other archaic hominins disappeared tens of thousands of years ago. To investigate how gene regulation diverges between closely related primates, we therefore examined the evolution of DNA methylation (a chemical mark that can affect gene activity) and gene expression levels in wild baboons?another highly social, large-bodied primate, where closely related yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus) and anubis baboons (P. anubis) still intermix to form hybrids.

Specifically, we characterized yellow versus anubis baboon ancestry genome-wide for hundreds of baboons in a Kenyan hybrid zone, in conjunction with DNA methylation and gene expression data for a large subset of the same individuals. We found evidence that natural selection acts to eliminate anubis baboon ancestry in this primarily yellow baboon study population, a result that mirrors apparent selection against Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans. We also found that genetic differences between species, which are mostly due to differences in the frequencies of genetic variants, can be used to predict differences in gene expression and DNA methylation differences between those species?thus demonstrating that differences in gene regulation are the product of genetic evolution. Finally, we found that natural selection against introgressed ancestry has been stronger in regions of the genome where gene expression differs most between yellow and anubis baboons. Our findings support hypotheses about natural selection against gene regulatory variants after archaic hominin-human interbreeding. Additionally, because hybrid baboons often successfully survive and reproduce, they show that selection against hybridization can be detected at the genetic level, even if it is not obvious from field observations. Together, our findings thus reinforce the importance of gene regulation in primate divergence and diversification, and in maintaining separation between closely related primate species. 

 

BROADER IMPACTS: This project has resulted in three sets of broader impacts. First, the co-PI incorporated his research into a lesson plan for high school biology students that was shared through SciREN, a local non-profit organization focused on improving K-12 science education in North Carolina. This lesson plan helps meet North Carolina state essential standards for high school biology in Evolution and Genetics by including examples from baboons and humans to understand how genetics and the environment influence trait variation. It also communicates how DNA technology can be applied to studying wild primate populations. Second, this project supported scientific training for the co-PI and two other graduate students to develop skills in molecular lab techniques, bioinformatics, and statistics. Additionally, it generated data and analyses that have helped developed and support ongoing collaborations with Kenyan scientists at the Institute of Primate Research in Nairobi, Kenya. Finally, the PI and co-PI discussed the results of this project with scientific audiences at multiple conferences, workshops, and external seminar series, and in undergraduate courses.

"A growing body of research in biological anthropology and related disciplines indicates that an individual's early life environment can have long-term effects on their physiology and well-being. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate whether maternal nutrition and breastfeeding duration are associated with the amount and distribution of fat that infants have between birth and four months of age, in a population with high and rising rates of infant, child, and adult obesity. Certain fat distributions are thought to be related to the risk of obesity, and this fundamental research will be important in characterizing variation in infant growth and development and for comparisons with data from other populations. The research will contribute to our broader understanding of human biological variation and adaptations, and the evolution of modern human life history, and could inform public health research on the global obesity epidemic. The project will provide research training and scientific education in a STEM field to graduate and undergraduate students from the U.S., and build both research capacity and collaborations at the research site.

The investigator will use a longitudinal design to collect data on infant size and fatness in Samoan infants, as they grow from birth to four months of age, using the ""gold standard"" dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) technique. The use of DEXA will allow for measurement of both total body fat and body fat distribution. She will test whether maternal nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding duration are associated with how much fat infants have at birth and four months, as well as the body regions where fat is distributed. Greater fat stored around the organs and less fat directly stored under the skin is thought to increase the risk for cardiovascular disease in adults. The data generated in this project may inform the design of future interventions that target the prevention of obesity at the earliest point. In addition, findings from this project will contribute to the understanding of how fat growth in early life varies by population history and the current environmental stresses a population faces (e.g., highly pathogenic environments and highly caloric, low nutritional environments), and will be relevant to all human populations.",NSF,Yale University,CT,22340,1749911,claudia.valeggia@yale.edu,Claudia,Valeggia,1,"What are the factors that influence fat growth during infancy? This study investigated how ethnicity, maternal diet during pregnancy, and breastfeeding duration affect where in the body and how much fat infants deposit during the first four months of life. This question is important because infancy is a critical period for lifelong cardiometabolic health?some of the factors investigated here may increase later risk for obesity and other metabolic disease. One such factor is fat pattering: fat deposited viscerally (surrounding the organs) as opposed to subcutaneously (directly beneath the skin) and centrally versus peripherally, has been shown to increase a person?s risk for cardiometabolic disease. Some populations, as early as birth, are more likely to deposit fat in these depots. Why that is, is unknown.  

Our study took place in Samoa because it is one of several ethnic minorities with high rates of obesity and a known genetic predisposition toward obesity. Polynesian evolutionary history involved the settling the Pacific Islands and may have favored adaptations that promote conserving energy and storing fat. This is supported by a recent finding that some Samoans possess a gene variant in CREBRF that isassociated with higher BMI and extremely rare in other populations. While previously this adaptation may have protected Samoans during settlement of the islands, in the current environment of overabundant, calorically-dense foods it may be maladaptive. We hypothesized that due to the gene and environment interaction, infant adipose tissue growth is unprecedented in Samoans. To test this, I recruited 160 pregnant women and followed them at three time points, when the baby was born, two months old and four months old. We used the 'gold standard' Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) for precise measurement of adipose tissue during the period.

Our first aim was to 1) compare our measures of infant adipose tissue with other populations. Second, we 2) explored theoretically important correlates of total adipose tissue growth from birth to four months of age, namely maternal nutritional status during pregnancy and infant feeding practices. Third, we 3) explored the relationship between the same correlates and regional distribution of adipose tissue growth. 

Comparing Samoan total fat at birth and four months with other populations

Early analyses suggest that Samoans weigh more at birth and may have a greater proportion of fat compared to other populations. Comparing my data to other published studies showed that Samoans have the second highest amount of body fat compared to 11 other cohorts that included multiethnic U.S., Swedish, Danish, Indian, Australian and Ethiopian infants. Our next efforts are to perform Samoa DXA comparisons to U.S. populations. 

Maternal nutritional status and infant feeding practices on total fat at birth

Overall there was little evidence that the amount of carbohydrates, fat, protein or micronutrients mothers ate during the third trimester of their pregnancy influenced infants? body fat at birth or four months. We did find that mothers of males who ate a higher proportion of fat during pregnancy had infants with less fat-free mass at birth. This finding, however, still requires more data to confirm because of the small sample. As expected and shown in other studies, babies that were exclusively breastfed gained less body fat from birth to four months and had lower BMIs. There was no evidence that the CREBRFvariant had any effect on body fat in infants, contrary to what we expected.

Maternal nutritional status and infant feeding practices on total fat visceral and subcutaneous fat

There were no relationships between maternal diet during pregnancy and regional fat. Our data did however suggest that infants have more total (sum of all skinfolds) and central (sum of suprailiac and subscapular skinfolds) subcutaneous fat, but no difference in abdominal circumference if they are breastfed exclusively from birth to four months of age. These findings are not statistically significant, however they are borderline significant and with a larger sample may have been. If these results are confirmed, they would validate that exclusive breastfeeding for at least four months may reduce the risk of fat deposition in areas associated with cardiometabolic disease in later life.  

Broader Impacts

These findings will inform current knowledge on what factors influence infant adipose biology and provide data for public health clinics in Samoa. The study trained four research assistants, three American undergraduates and a Samoan enumerator, on research methods. In the U.S. two undergraduates have written their theses with the data and three other graduate students are currently being trained to analyze and publish findings from this data. Four posters on preliminary findings have been presented at three different academic conferences. The Co-PI will disseminate her final findings in Samoa to the local hospital, Ministry of Health, and Samoan community, including the participants, in December 2019.

"Addressing the food needs of an increasing global population in the 21st century will require significant improvements in agriculture akin to the Green Revolution of the previous century. To address this goal it is of critical importance to understand as much as possible about the functions of the tens of thousands of genes present in each plant species, in order to select those functions of most relevance to engineering favorable traits such as drought tolerance or increased grain quality.  Much of what is currently known about plant gene function comes from experiments in model plant systems such as Arabidopsis thaliana, but because of evolutionary relatedness this information can be used to predict the functions of genes in crop species such as maize and rice, and to provide targeted hypotheses that can be followed up by further experiments.  This project will increase both the efficiency and accuracy of gene function prediction in plants by organizing and integrating high quality data from a number of sources and presenting it in a user-friendly format that makes clear the evolutionary relationships between genes.  The team will develop software for visualizing the evolutionary relationships as a gene family tree, providing an organizing framework for disparate experimental observations from a number of experimental systems.  The project will provide software for use, and for data sharing, by a broad community of both researchers and students.  The project?s inclusion of local community college students will provide training and increase participation in computer science, genomics and plant biology by groups that are underrepresented in these fields.

The project output will be a powerful and intuitive software tool for inferring plant gene function from phylogenetic relationships and experimental evidence.  To achieve this goal the project aims are to: 1) assemble sets of phylogenetic trees using selected model organism and plant genomes, along with a suite of web services to ensure easy access to the data; 2) follow user-driven design principles to design and build the user interface, in order to visualize the phylogenetic trees and associate the genes within each tree with high quality functional information including Gene Ontology annotations, gene expression patterns, protein domains, sequence variations and mutant phenotypes; 3) provide an analysis platform that streamlines workflows and includes personal workspaces for users to add their own data and make it public when their work is completed, thus enriching the knowledgebase; and 4) produce workshops, course materials and online content to train scientists at all academic levels on how to use the software. The results of the project will be available at http://www.phoenixbioinformatics.org/treevision/.",NSF,Phoenix Bioinformatics Corporation,CA,1261211,1661543,huala@phoenixbioinformatics.org,Eva,Huala,1,"One of the great challenges facing modern biology is understanding the  rules of life, more specifically understanding the sets of rules that  predict an organism's observable characteristics that together make up  its phenotype.  We have built a new online resource, PhyloGenes, for  integration and display of plant gene function information on  precomputed phylogenetic trees for gene families spanning 40 plant  species and 10 non-plant model species.   PhyloGenes enables researchers  to observe and understand the evolution of gene function within these  gene families, which in turn underlies the observable physical traits  that distinguish one plant species from another.  Additionally, this new  online resource enables the translation of knowledge gleaned from the  study of model species to other species that may be more difficult to  study directly.  We aim to make it easier to use knowledge from model  species to understand the function of genes that control traits in other  plant species, including crops like corn, rice, soybean, wheat and  cotton as well as other species that can help us understand the  evolution of plants because of their position in the species tree.
 
 PhyloGenes contains information about 8,519 gene families containing  1,259,624 genes. We display information about experimentally determined  gene functions for 34,495 of these genes from 5,989 gene families, and  another 541,974 genes from 3,679 families are shown with functions that  are predicted based on their evolutionary relationship to genes that  have been studied. Each gene family page in PhyloGenes is composed of a  gene tree on the left, with speciation and gene duplication nodes  clearly indicated. These nodes can be collapsed or expanded, and trees  can be customized to display only the desired species. To the right of  the tree, gene function data are presented in rows aligned with the  genes in the tree. Experimentally validated gene functions are presented  as GO terms with evidence codes and literature citations. The function  panel display can be customized to show only the desired information and  can be swapped with a multiple sequence alignment with conserved  residues highlighted and each sequence aligned to the corresponding gene  within the tree. We have also provided a tool that allows a user to add  proteins from other species to see where they map within the PhyloGenes  trees and infer their function based on what is known about related  genes.

"The goal of this project is to create novel methods that help researchers gather and integrate existing data sets in order to better inform the design of future experiments. Ideally new experiments include some replication, fill in gaps and produce new knowledge, but this balance is hard to achieve when existing data sets are in different locations or organized in very different ways.  Thus to achieve the goal, two aims are proposed: 1) develop methods for creating cohesive biological datasets from public experiments such that they are suitable for training computational models; 2) develop methods that indicate what experimental conditions should be used to collect new datasets so that are the most likely to yield important information about the study organism's biological properties, like structure and behavior. Achieving this goal will enable an understanding of important rules of life for organisms more efficiently and economically, by focusing on the experiments that give us the most value for the funds spent.

This exploratory project will focus on data arising from genome-wide transcriptional profiling methods (e.g. microarrays, RNA-Seq), building a computational foundation for later expansion. First, optimal data processing techniques for creating integrated compendia will be assessed, in order to select the best method for building training datasets for machine learning methods. Second, data-driven computational models will be trained on the data compendia and evaluated for success in describing and microbial behavior. Third, given the normalized compendia (in the transcriptomics data space) an optimal experimental design methodology will be prototyped, to recommend the best set of experiments to perform to yield the complete set of data needed to fit and test the biological model. The experimental design methodology will be benchmarked using synthetic data, and then evaluated by exploring the effect of design- recommended combinations of antibiotics and antiseptics (10 in all) on microbial behavior. This will be compared to the outcomes of experiments designed by methods currently used. Success metrics will focus on how quickly the required information in the experimental space is gathered and what level of uncertainty in a model remains after each experiment is completed.",NSF,University of California-Davis,CA,300000,1743101,iliast@cs.ucdavis.edu,Ilias,Tagkopoulos,1,"The scientific method of formulating, testing, and ultimately accepting  hypotheses has been the way we have advanced science for centuries. Through human history, data are viewed as a means to test hypotheses or  discover associations and phenomena, and less as a means to train  computational methods across the various biological dimensions.  In the era of prediction, experimental design methods, such as those  based on optimal experimental design, also known as active  learning, have the potential to accelerate scientific exploration. In that context, how to design experiments that accelerate knowledge discovery on complex  biological landscapes remains a tantalizing question. This EAGER award funded the exploratory research that resulted in a new algorithmic framework and an optimal experimental design method (coined OPEX) to identify informative  omics experiments using machine learning models for both experimental  space exploration and model training. The team evaluated OPEX by letting it guide experiments with Escherichia coli populations exposed to biocide and antibiotic combinations and then compared the results to similar experiments guided by experts in the field. OPEX-guided RNA-Seq experiments lead to more  accurate predictive models of gene expression with 44% less data.  Analysis of the proposed experiments shows that broad exploration of the  experimental space followed by fine-tuning emerges as the optimal  strategy. Additionally, analysis of the experimental data reveals 29  cases of cross-stress protection and 4 cases of cross-stress  vulnerability, and further validation revealed the central role of  chaperones, stress response proteins and transport pumps in cross-stress  exposure. This work demonstrates how active learning can be used to  guide omics data collection for training predictive models, making  evidence-driven decisions and accelerating knowledge discovery in life  sciences.

"This award supports basic research regarding the question of how networks in the brain allow odors to be detected and perceived.  Such a question is of fundamental interest in neuroscience because responding to odors or scents is one of the most basic ecological abilities exhibited across different animal species.  Further, responses to odors are highly dependent on context.  For example, certain smells may create both attractive and repulsive reactions, depending on small differences in dilution or whether they are encountered alone or as components in a cocktail.  Thus, studying how the brain processes odors can provide important clues regarding how animals and humans sense and perceive in complex environments.  In seeking such understanding, this project uses a unique combination of methods from neuroscience, mathematics, and engineering.  Brain activity from two different animal species are recorded during experiments in which odors are presented in isolation and in mixtures.  Subsequently, data analysis and mathematical modeling is used to identify brain activity patterns that distinguish the reaction of the animals to the odors in question.  Hence, the project uncovers how particular brain networks transform and transmit odor information in a way that is central to the sense of smell.  To broaden the impact of these studies, the project includes the development of a summer internship in sensory neural engineering, intended to allow undergraduate and high school students to learn about and experience how different academic disciplines contribute to future brain science.

The extent to which sensory networks amplify or suppress perceived differences in odor valence remains a fundamental, unanswered question in sensory neuroscience.  The overarching hypothesis of this project is that indeed, there exists a well-defined set of transformations, governed by neuronal dynamics, which map sensory network activity to behavior.  Specifically, the project will determine: (a) How neural networks enable the formation of time-varying neural activation patterns, or, trajectories, in response to sensory stimuli, (b) The mapping from trajectories to behavioral outcome, and (c) The commonality of this mapping across species.  The research goals use an interdisciplinary approach combining sensory systems neuroscience in two species, locusts (Schistocerca americana) and round worms (C. elegans), with computational modeling and dynamical systems theory.  Neural and behavioral responses are recorded from animals receiving nominally attractive and aversive odors, and these data inform computational models of the sensory networks and ensuing behaviors.  The models generate predictions on how behavioral responses might be modulated by a change in selectivity, or background state.  The latter is tested through a paradigm wherein animals are systematically fed or starved, thus shifting their response dynamics on the aversive-attractive spectrum.  Subsequently, model-based sensitivity analyses is used to predict mixture response curves and paradoxical mixtures (e.g., two aversive stimuli that when mixed, elicit an attractive response).  These predictions are tested by delivering component stimuli in systematic ratios.  Thus, the overall methodology combines physiological experiments with new systems-level analysis in an integrated, multidisciplinary modeling-theory loop.",NSF,Washington University,MO,469503,1724218,shinung@ese.wustl.edu,ShiNung,Ching,1,"Responding to a sensory stimulus in a manner appropriate to its context is a basic ecological ability exhibited across species.  For instance, certain odors may elicit different responses when encountered in combination with other odors, than when encountered alone. How the brain represents these differences remains an important and unanswered question in brain science. Thus, the major goal of this project was to uncover principles for how sensory networks in the brain form robust and decodable representations of sensory stimuli. The specific sensory modality studied was olfaction, or the sense of smell. To pursue the major goal, the research used an interdisciplinary approach, combining mathematical modeling of brain networks with experiments to record from brain cells in animals as they encountered different olfactory stimuli. The modeling phase of the research entailed the development of mathematical criteria that are theorized to be relevant to the functions of sensory detection and response. Methods from engineering were then used to build computational models of neural circuits that best satisfy the posed mathematical criteria. The resultant model predicts how neural circuits would act if they were working according to principles that can be described and rigorously quantified. The experiment phase of the research entailed recording from sensory neurons in two model organisms, C. elegans and locust, to assess how actual brain cells in these animals responded to stimuli. The experiments provided key information to either validate or refine the theoretical models. Over the life of the award, the synergistic back and forth between modeling and experiments yielded several key outcomes. One such outcome was an explanation for an enigmatic phenomenon, wherein some sensory neurons activate rapidly on the appearance of a stimulus, while others do so on its withdrawal. It turns out that such activation patterns are a particularly effective way to convey a sensory representation, allowing smells to be efficiently and quickly detected and acted upon. These patterns also help the brain to prepare for subsequent stimuli. Another key outcome pertained to how the brain adapts to a repeated exposure to the same sensory stimuli. In this situation, it turns out that while neurons may adapt their responses over time, the brain can nonetheless maintain a stable and actionable representation of a stimulus. In total, these research outcomes give us new insights into how neurons encode sensory stimuli as a function of time and prior history. The results from the award have been disseminated through several peer reviewed publications and presentations made by the investigators and trainees who performed the research. Computational code associated with the mathematical models is also available through open access repositories documented in the archival publications. Alongside the research outcomes were broader impacts, including the development of a new graduate course for students in engineering and neuroscience to learn about how mathematical approaches are being used to study brain function. This course was offered twice during the life of the award and brought together a diverse group of students in engineering and brain science within a unique training setting.

"The rapid expansion of massively-parallel sequencing (MPS, or ""next-generation sequencing"") technology has revolutionized molecular microbial ecology by making the detailed analysis of complex communities over time and space a tractable research pursuit for small research groups. While the advent of MPS methods has allowed microbial ecologists to ask meaningful questions with ever-greater precision, it brings significant challenges to individual small laboratories struggling to manage megabytes or even gigabytes of data. This project will sustain the web service VAMPS (Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures, http://vamps.mbl.edu), which removes the need for individual research groups to make the considerable investment in computational infrastructure and bioinformatic support otherwise necessary to process, analyze, and interpret MPS data for microbial ecology. VAMPS is a free, open-source database-driven website that allows researchers using MPS data to analyze the diversity of microbial communities and the relationships between communities, to explore these analyses in an intuitive visual context, and to download analyses and images for publication. Any web-capable device can be used to upload, process, explore, and extract data and results from VAMPS, and the VAMPS development team is available to assist in all aspects of data processing and analysis. VAMPS encourages researchers to share sequence and metadata, and fosters collaboration between researchers of disparate biomes who recognize common patterns in shared data. VAMPS currently hosts more than 200 projects encompassing more than 5000 datasets and over 250 million sequence tags, is used by nearly 1000 investigators from around the world, and has supported at least 15 NSF-funded projects. VAMPS provides unique educational opportunities through its combination of data from a variety of environments, its integration of sequence cluster-based and taxonomy-based analytical and visualization tools, and the instruction provided by project developers.

VAMPS is designed for visualization, exploration, and analysis of amplicon tag data in a comparative context. Sequence data and associated metadata can be uploaded directly by users or by sending data to the VAMPS project team; MPS reads can be automatically quality filtered and assigned to both taxonomic structures and to taxonomic-independent clusters. These can then be linked to metadata and compared using a wide variety of analytical and visualization tools. Each result is extensively hyperlinked to other analysis and visualization options, promoting data exploration and leading to a greater understanding of data relationships. A major strength of VAMPS is that researchers can compare not only datasets within their own projects but can compare these with datasets from projects such as NSF-funded Long Term Ecological Research projects, the International Census of Marine Microbes, the Human Microbiome Project, and hundreds of other individual projects. The project will support: 1) Active releases of QIIME, OTU clustering methods, oligotyping, and other methods as authors release new versions. 2) A VAMPS administrator to support users in uploading and trimming data and the use of the many VAMPS visualization and analysis tools, exporting data for other analytical methods and images for publication, and facilitating collaborations and adding new portals. 3) Incorporation of new publicly available data. Projects of particular interest include the Earth Microbiome Project, the American Gut Project, and Terra Oceans that have or will have data that would benefit the research community if made available through VAMPS. 4) Adapting analysis capabilities to other appropriate genes as requested by the community. 5) Hardware and software maintenance and data storage. All results of the project can be found at vamps.mbl.edu.",NSF,Marine Biological Laboratory,MA,547038,1661351,dmarkwelch@mbl.edu,David,Mark Welch,1,"The rapid expansion of sequencing technologies with the concurrent drastic drop in costs has revolutionized molecular microbial ecology by making the detailed analysis of complex communities over time and space a tractable research pursuit for small research groups.  The ability to generate 107 reads from 100 samples for a single project with relative ease brings with it many downstream complications.  Beyond the computational resources and skills needed to analyze data, it is difficult to compare datasets, which may represent spatial or temporal gradients, changes to a community in response to nutrients or stress, or the response of a biota to its host, in an intuitive and interactive manner that leads to hypothesis generation.

This project sustained the web service VAMPS (Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures, http://vamps.mbl.edu).  VAMPS is a free, open-source database-driven website that allows researchers using data from massively-parallel sequencing (MPS, or ""next-generation sequencing"") projects to analyze the diversity of microbial communities and the relationships between communities, to explore these analyses in an intuitive visual context, and to download analyses and images for publication.

Key outcomes of the award include:

1. Conversion from the original VAMPS website (vamps.mbl.edu) to VAMPS2 (vamps2.mbl.edu).  VAMPS2 uses node.js code design refactoring for improved maintainability, modularity, and portability.  The speed of real-time analyses is significantly improved over VAMPS, particularly the ability to analyze many datasets simultaneously.  The new user interface represents considerable input from our many users and includes the ability to more easily manage multiple visual analyses, the ability to save projects (sets of datasets and taxonomies), and the ability to select between alternate taxonomies. 

2. Extensive search and selection options to navigate the 1,000+ projects and 200,000+ datasets in VAMPS2.  Users can:

    a) select projects or datasets by owner (user), portal, name, partial name, or key word;

    b) select datasets based on metadata criteria, environmental source, or amplicon target;

    c) select datasets over a specified geographic range;

    d) find all datasets containing a designated taxon;

    e) find all occurrences of a sequence or similar sequence using BLAST.

3.  Creation of ten data portals for ""meta projects"" including the Coral Microbiome Project; the Census of Deep Life; the Human Microbiome Project; the International Census of Marine Microbes; Microbial Inventory Research Across Diverse Aquatic Long Term Ecological Research Sites; Microbiology of Built Environments; and the Plastisphere.  

4. Improved data submission tools, including Django API for sequence and metadata cleaning and confirmation.

5. Extensive improvements to the VAMPS2 database, including switching database code to MariaDB, removing obsolete tables, cleaning data and data structures, and extensive normalization.  This has resulted in improved response times despite a drastic increase in database size.

6. The new VAMPS2 database can store metagenomic data (ie data is not constrained to regions of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene).  This represents a significant advance in our goal to expand VAMPS services.  In addition to multiple regions of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic samll subunit amplicon target regions we have added as proof of principle ITS1 and more than 30 fungal ITS1 datasets.  Development of new tools to fully analyze metagenomic data is outside the objectives and resources of this project but will be pursued by other means.

7. The VAMPS database can be accessed directly via API using instructions available here: https://github.com/hsosik/MBVL/tree/master/prototypes/vamps_api_interaction

At the conclusion of the project, VAMPS contained records of more than 430 million unique sequences representing more than 6 billion amplicon reads, from nearly 215 thousand datasets organized in more than a thousand different projects.  

Each year of the award hundreds of new users registered to use VAMPS.  In addition to project leads submitting data to the site this includes dozens of users per project that use the site to collaboratively analyze their data.  Beyond these, more than a hundred new users each year register to use publicly available data for research and education.  Portals to metaprojects such as ""the human microbiome"" or ""the plastisphere"" facilitate the use of VAMPS as an educational tool. 

VAMPS has been used in the MBL Advanced Training Course STAMPS (Strategies and Techniques for the Analysis of Microbial Population Structure), which trains ~60 graduate students, postdocs, and PIs each year in methods of metagenomic sequence analysis. 

VAMPS is used in the University of Chicago undergraduate course Microbes Across Environments, taught every fall at the MBL since 2017.  VAMPS is particularly effective in introducing non-majors and others without extensive bioinformatic training to concepts of microbial community analysis.

Beginning in early 2020, the MBL began a program of immersion experiences for secondary school students.  VAMPS was used as an easily accessible tool for microbial community analysis that required no computational experience.  Though this program has been curtailed by the pandemic we expect it to continue and for VAMPS to be a critical tool in the microbiome component.

"Baishakhi Basu of the University of Washington will conduct research that aims to clarify the mechanisms by which early life and late life undernutrition affects ovarian aging and menopause in Bangladeshi women. The study is inspired by the abundant evidence that the age at which women in resource-poor settings experience menopause is about 6 months earlier than what is found in resource-abundant settings. The underlying biological cause of this discrepancy is unknown. One component of the study will investigate how nutritional stress in fetal life and childhood affects menstrual cycles during the transition that leads to menopause.  Another component of the research will investigate whether nutritional stress later in life decreases the age at which menopause occurs. The broader impact of this study will be to elucidate the mechanisms by which nutrition in early life and nutritional stress in later life affects the reproductive biology and function in women.  The study will potentially identify which biological mechanisms shorten the reproductive lifespan for women under nutritional stress.

The research has two distinct components.  The first examines pathways through which fetal life and childhood nutrition may affect the process of ovarian aging.  During the transition to menopause, the near depletion of the ovarian follicle pool is reflected by increasingly irregular menstrual cycles.  This study hypothesizes that undernutrition during early-life leads to a smaller ovarian follicle pool established in fetal life and/or accelerates the rate at which the follicle pool is reduced.  Either effect would result in an earlier depletion of the pool of ovarian follicles and, consequently, an earlier transition to menopause.  The research will utilize previously collected menstrual calendars on 2,300 rural Bangladeshi women born before, during and after a severe famine in 1974. The women were born in households that participated in a 1974 socio-economic survey, so the hypothesis is examined by testing for any statistical associations between household wealth in 1974 and the age a woman starts transitioning to menopause.  The second component examines whether women experience a type of stress-related amenorrhea (absence of menstrual cycles) that disrupts menstrual cycles before the pool of ovarian follicles is fully depleted (true menopause).  This so-called hypothalamic amenorrhea is indistinguishable from, and therefore can be mistaken with, true menopause.  To test this idea, Basu will conduct a two month long investigation with the participation of 500 rural Bangladeshi women who have stopped cycling in the past 9-15 months.

"Funding is provided to Florida State University to stage a workshop at the 2017 Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) annual meeting in Helsinki, Finland. GBIF is a repository for global biodiversity data of critical importance to the U.S. research community. GBIF's data include accessions from developing countries, some of the most biodiversity rich countries but whose data are usually inaccessible to U.S.-based researchers. The workshop will engage managers of biodiversity information (GBIF Node Managers) from several developing countries. This effort facilitates increased accessibility of biodiversity information and benefits U.S.-based researchers as they will be able to leverage these data for their scientific and other benefits. 

The meeting of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) will be held on September 23-24, 2017 in Helsinki Finland. A goal of this meeting is to increase the ability of GBIF National Nodes to contribute to the biodiversity information that is available globally. Access to biodiversity data through the GBIF portal benefits the U.S. research community by making available crucial data from across the globe, including developing countries whose data is often difficult to obtain. The supported workshop facilitates the participation of Node Managers from some developing countries. These individuals are usually tasked with the responsibility, or involved in the decision-making process, that impacts the availability of, and access to biodiversity information from their countries. The workshop also facilitates the sharing of digitization expertise and associated technologies, potentially resulting in overall improved data quality. Additionally, collaborations developed as a result of this workshop will facilitate U.S. researchers' navigation of the requirements of the Nagoya Protocol in their pursuit of data from other countries. Citizen science initiatives, that have proven successful in the U.S. and other developed countries, will also be discussed. If these public engagement strategies are adopted by resource managers in developing countries, they have the potential for broad community engagement across national boundaries resulting in more data of higher quality.",NSF,Florida State University,FL,74544,1743973,griccardi@fsu.edu,Gregory,Riccardi,1,"Major Activities:


We successfully planned and coordinated the GBIF Global Node Managers Meeting in September 2017.

Specific Objectives:


The main objective for this meeting was to enable the collaboration, professional development, networking, and training of national infrastructure managers for all member countries of GBIF. We were particularly concerned that we support the travel costs for countries with limited financial resources for international travel.

Significant Results:


Funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) supported people and facilities. The 60 attendees represented over 33 countries, including: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Benin, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Estonia, Finland, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Marutania, Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Phillipines, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, United Kingdom, and USA.

The NSF funding supported 17 people, including iDigBio staff Gil Nelson and Deb Paul. Funds for five others went unused as they had last minute travel issues (visa problems) or conflicts. Participants supported include: Anabela Plos (Argentina), Christian Elloran (ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity), Jean Ganglo (Benin), Zheping Xu (CAS), Mao-Ning Tuanmu (Chinese Taipei), Dairo Escobar (Colombia), Leonardo Buitrago (Colombia), Gautam Talukdar (India), Ofer Steinitz (Israel), Baba Ainina (Mauritania), Omokafe Ugbogu (Nigeria), Hulda Gideon (Tanzania), Pierre Radji (Togo), and Jo Judge (UK).

Key outcomes or Other achievements:


A major achievement was in extending the GBIF outreach to new countries. First timers to a GBIF Global Nodes Meeting include: Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and external observers: Croatia, Guatemala, and Russia.

Russia has subsequently made significant progress data mobilization and capacity building. For example, the two Russion observers published a paper Biodiversity databases in Russia: towards a national portal. Natalya V. Ivanova, Maxim P. Shashkov Arctic Science, 2017, 3:560-576, https://doi.org/10.1139/as-2016-0050. Several workshops were also held to support data publishing and skills needs.

"Research on the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) has shown that the prenatal environment can be associated with long-term risks for chronic and metabolic disorders, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes. This biocultural doctoral dissertation project investigates how maternal stress during the perinatal period shapes the development of the central stress response system in infants, in a population undergoing rapid social and economic change. This work will contribute to our understanding of the factors shaping fetal development from an evolutionary life history perspective, and offer insights into the social and biological underpinnings of the rising rates of metabolic diseases around the world.  The research findings may inform policy on maternal care during pregnancy. The project will also support graduate student training and international collaborations and research capacity. 

The fetal origins framework has shown that maternal psychosocial stress can modify fetal development, programming a fetus's HPA axis with permanent consequences on a variety of systems, leading to increased risk of metabolic disease. While previous research has examined isolated mechanisms linking maternal stress to infant HPA axis dysregulation, largely in wealthy, biomedical settings, the proposed research investigates how multiple pathways work in tandem from the second trimester through early infancy to shape HPA axis development in a middle-income, ecological setting. Through twelve months of mixed methods data collection, including semi-structured interviews, stress scales, and biomarker testing, this project seeks to contribute to anthropology not only as an important case study on maternal stress in a nation undergoing dramatic change, but also as an investigation that will add a critical component to the understanding of DOHaD as a larger phenomenon shaping health.  Specifically, the researchers will investigate: the role of prenatal maternal stress, the role of placental 11ß-HSD2 expression, and the role of postnatal maternal stress in the development of the infant HPA axis. The proposed work emphasizes the continuum of early development from the prenatal into the postnatal period. In addition to investigating maternal stress at multiple time points during pregnancy, the work adds the examination of placental 11ß-HSD2 expression and of stress in the postnatal period as integrated pathways through which the HPA axis can be modified in offspring.",NSF,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,NC,25194,1730297,althomps@email.unc.edu,Amanda,Thompson,1,"Project Outcomes:

This work incorporated the understudied roles of the postpartum period, epigenetic regulation in the placenta, and the gut microbiome into existing models for infant HPA axis development that have continuously reported inconsistent findings. Since the infant HPA axis has consistently been associated with metabolic and neurobehavioral disorders in later life, disentangling the mechanisms that underpin early HPA axis dysregulation is essential. While other research has examined isolated mechanisms linking maternal stress to infant HPA axis dysregulation largely in wealthy, biomedical settings, this project investigated how various biological pathways work in tandem to shape HPA axis development in the Gal&aacute;pagos, a middle-income, ecological setting (n = 38).

First, we found that maternal social support is a marker of distress in women in the Gal&aacute;pagos and that the postpartum period can attenuate prenatal insults to infant HPA axis development, thus providing support for a continuum of early development and emphasizing the importance of early life as a developmental niche. Second, we found that physiological stress during pregnancy, measured through maternal HPA axis dysregulation, is associated with lower placental HSD11B2 expression, which is associated with an exaggerated cortisol reactivity in infants. Further, maternal psychosocial distress during pregnancy was marginally associated with more placental HSD11B2 methylation and significantly associated with less HSD11B2 expression for the mothers of girls, but not boys. Last, we found that maternal precarity and HPA axis dysregulation were associated with an increase in pathogenic bacteria in the infant microbiome, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Veillonellaceae, and a decrease in protective bacteria, including Bifidobacteriaceae and Lachnospiraceae, as well as a decrease in overall microbiota diversity. Together, these findings contribute novel insights into early human development trajectories and reinforce the importance of using multidimensional measures of ""stress"" to investigate early environments.

 

Intellectual Merit:

Much of the work on maternal stress and the developmental origins of health and disease has been limited to the study of maternal stress hormones, particularly cortisol, and has not included other potential mechanisms of HPA axis programming or considered how mechanisms may work together. In contrast, this work emphasized the continuum of early development from the prenatal into the postnatal period. Further, this work integrated the examination of placental HSD11B2 expression methylation as well as the infant gut microbiome into pathways through which the HPA axis can be modified in offspring.

Previous work had found that HSD11B2 converts maternal cortisol into inactive cortisone in the placenta. In our study, maternal physiological stress was associated with lower placental HSD11B2 expression, which was associated with an exaggerated cortisol reactivity in infants. This finding suggests that maternal stress decreases the protective effect of HSD11B2. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine how both HSD11B2 methylation and expression in the placenta respond to maternal distress and shape infant cortisol. Further, we believe this is only the second study to examine how differences in HSD11B2 measures shape infant HPA axis regulation in humans.

Additionally, while HPA axis dysregulation is thought to be the primary mechanism through which prenatal maternal stress is linked to metabolic disease and neurobehavioral disorders later in life, dysbiosis of the infant gut microbiome has also been associated with risk for metabolic and neurobehavioral disorders, suggesting it could be a candidate for involvement in this pathway. We tested this hypothesis, finding that maternal precarity and HPA axis dysregulation were associated with an increase in pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in more protective bacteria in the infant microbiome. To our knowledge, this is only the second study to assess the effects of maternal prenatal stress on infant gut microbiome development and associated HPA axis function in humans, and it is the first study to include both prenatal and postnatal stress in these models.

Last, though chronic disease disproportionately affects middle-income countries, little research on its development has taken place within these contexts.

 

Broader Impacts:

This project contributed to the PhD training of a female biological anthropology student in field methods and data analysis. It also built research capacity with Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ) in collaborating with local hospital staff and training research assistants in anthropological methods. The research contributed new empirical insights to the social and biological pathways through which mothers and their offspring embody stress during pregnancy and how this stress shapes the development of the HPA axis and subsequent metabolic diseases in a middle-income nation context, where metabolic disease prevalence is rising rapidly. Pregnancy offers a unique opportunity to mitigate chronic disease, and this work will build understanding of the factors shaping fetal development. This research may have global applications and could shape policy on prenatal care. I have shared my results with colleagues at USFQ and local health officials, and I presented my results at USFQ's summer colloquium series in 2019, which includes local students and interested members of the community.

"The timing, location, and circumstances of the origin of modern humans has long been of interest among paleoanthropologists and the public. Ongoing studies continue to refine our understanding of early modern humans, and these studies necessarily rely on sparse fossil evidence. This doctoral dissertation project will contribute to the known fossil record for a critical time and place by describing newly-recovered early modern human fossil material near the time of modern human range expansion beyond Africa. The project will support mentoring and training of undergraduate students, including female and first-generation college students. It will also support the establishment of long-standing positive connections between young researchers and research institutions, and their continued participation in research and educational activities. The results of this project will be communicated to the public via a broadcasted radio interview and other media. 

This project includes the original description of the skeletal anatomy of an early modern human partial skeleton, as well as additional, more fragmentary human fossil material recovered from the same sedimentary package. These fossils were recovered from a Middle Stone Age archaeological context at Halibee, Middle Awash, preliminarily dated to ~100 kya. The skeletal anatomy of these fossils will be described with reference to anatomically modern human populations, and systematic comparisons of the Halibee fossils with their closest fossil relatives will be completed, including Neanderthals, Homo erectus, and chronologically intermediate groups. Understanding how Middle Pleistocene fossils relate to one another and to later modern humans has been hindered by the sparseness of the Pleistocene postcranial fossil record, and by the variable combinations of plesiomorphic and derived traits displayed by the known fossil specimens. The chronological and geographic position of the Halibee fossils makes them critical to understanding these relationships.",NSF,University of California-Berkeley,CA,19060,1732221,hlusko@berkeley.edu,Leslea,Hlusko,1,"The timing, location, and circumstances of the origin of modern humans has long been of interest, and ongoing research continues to improve our understanding of early modern human evolution. However, gaining a clearer picture of when, where, and how modern humans evolved relies on the available fossil evidence, which at present is spread irregularly across geography and through time, and includes mostly partial skulls and teeth with comparatively fewer postcranial bones (i.e., everything below the neck). Considering the limitations of the current fossil record, new fossil evidence is of the utmost importance to the study of modern human origins.

The Middle Awash project has recovered an early modern human partial skeleton, along with additional, more fragmentary human postcranial fossils. These fossils were recovered from a Middle Stone Age archaeological context preliminarily dated to ~100 thousand years, within a locality area named Halibee in the Middle Awash research area in Ethiopia?s Afar Depression. The major goal of this research project was to complete the initial description of the skeletal anatomy of this modern human partial skeleton and the associated postcranial remains. In order to describe the fossils comprehensively and discover how they inform our understanding of human evolution, the initial description was done comparatively by placing the fossils in the context of recent modern human variation, and the variation we see in fossils of genus Homo over the course of the last two million years. Measurements and qualitative observations were collected from the Halibee fossils and from five recent modern human groups, which collectively span five museums. The Halibee fossils are housed in the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa, and the modern human skeletons studied for comparison span the Smithsonian?s National Museum of Natural History (groups from northeastern Africa and the Levant), the Raymond A. Dart Collection at University of the Witwatersrand (southern Africa), the 21st Century Identified Skeletal Collection at the University of Coimbra (western Europe), and the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology at University of California, Berkeley (North American). Comparative data for Homo fossils from the last approximately two million years were collected from the published literature, and include Homo erectus, Neanderthals, pre-modern humans, and chronologically intermediate fossils.

The results of this study include the taxonomic identification of the fossils (i.e., to which species do they belong?). The fossils are assigned to Homo sapiens, based on the presence of some key pieces of the anatomy that researchers agree are diagnostically modern human, including the presence of a chin and a vertically-oriented forehead. The age, sex, and height estimates for the partial skeleton indicate that the individual was a young to middle-aged male of tall stature. Comparisons of the partial skeleton with the recent modern human groups indicate that this individual falls well within the modern human range of variation for most skeletal traits, but falls at the edge of or just outside of the range for a few traits. This is in line with previous findings for other fossils from this approximate time period, which present a combination of modern and pre-modern features.

The description of these previously unpublished fossils contributes to the known fossil record at a critical time and place, near the time of modern human range expansion beyond Africa. The position of the Halibee fossils places them within a population ancestral or closely related to modern humans, which allows us to get at key questions about early human evolution, such as: How does early modern human skeletal anatomy compare to present-day humans? How were early modern humans anatomically different than (or similar to) Neanderthals, and what might this tell us about how evolution has proceeded over the most recent portion (last ~100 thousand years) of our evolutionary history? Considering the relative scarcity of associated postcranial material in this most recent portion of the fossil record, the Halibee fossils constitute a significant addition to the sample available for study, and the description of these fossils makes these data available to researchers focused on specific questions about human evolution.  

This project has supported mentoring and research experience for five UC Berkeley undergraduate students, and has broadened the participation of women and first-generation college students in STEM research. The data collection portion of this project fostered the establishment of positive connections between an early career researcher and museums and research institutions, both domestic and abroad. This work was shared with a public audience via an interview with ?The Graduates,? a publicly-broadcasted radio program on the Berkeley KALX radio station that aims to communicate science to the public while highlighting UC Berkeley graduate student research.

"Life on Earth is thought to have emerged in water phase. It is not known whether the chemical processes of Life can only occur in a polar liquid like water, or also in non-polar, oily liquids. This project will examine chemistry in non-polar phases to ask whether certain aspects of genetic coding and mutation with selection can take place in the absence of water. The project will provide training in organic chemistry, biochemistry and physical chemistry to many students. 

Water is assumed to be a necessity for life. This project will study a counter-factual proposition that certain aspects of extant life on Earth, including genetic coding and mutation with selection, can be reimplemented in the absence of water. To that end, the solubility, folding, assembly and co-assembly of non-polar homologs of canonical nucleic acid monomers and oligomers, wherein the phosphodiester linkage is substituted with a non-polar linkage will be characterized. Dynamic-covalent reactions as alternatives to base-pairing in organic media will be explored and in vitro selection will be performed in oil phase and in oil-water alternating regimes.

Our quantitative analysis has revealed a new understanding of the centrality of water in biochemistry, both as a medium and in chemical processes. This understanding can help us understand prebiotic chemistry and the chemical origins of life. 
The simplest explanation for what one observes in extant biochemistry is that prebiotic chemical selection, leading to life, was substantially directed by water. Water was a primary gate-keeper that allowed in or denied access to organic molecules and metals during prebiotic chemistry. Specifically, chemical evolution selected building blocks that (i) were soluble in water, (ii) were chemically transformed by water, (iii) chemically transformed water, (iii) joined covalently, by (iv) condensation-dehydration reactions with near equilibrium thermodynamics with accessible kinetics. Building blocks that participated in water chemistry and were chemically linked via water chemistry were selected to form small chimeras (e.g. triglycerides, coenzyme A, nucleotides) and large homogeneous polymers (DNA, RNA, protein, polysaccharide). Potential building blocks that did not participate in water chemistry were excluded. This scenario explains the exclusion of various molecules from extant biochemistry, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are highly abundant in the abiotic universe, but do not react with water.
Our work with non-aqueous media caused us to evaluate, in new ways, why biology uses water as a medium, instead of other liquids. Using water as a medium, we developed an experimental platform that accomplishes chemical evolution in the laboratory. Our design was guided by the assumption that chemical evolution is based on the chemistry of water and is robust and does not require highly specific combinations of purified reagents or interventions such as purifications by chromatography. We experimentally demonstrate chemical evolution and describe empirical outcomes, some of which were not foreseen. During general chemical evolution, chemical change is continuous and recursive, new chemical spaces are explored, molecular subpopulations are synchronized, and environmental energy is harvested and exploited for chemical selection, molecular diversity is constrained, and emergence is spontaneous. By performing and characterizing general chemical evolution, we are broadly poised to understand and manipulate it. Our results suggest that prebiotic chemical evolution is a specific example of a more universal water-based phenomenon that we call general chemical evolution.
This project employed and supported the training and professional development of more than nineteen young scientists, including early career faculty, research faculty and staff, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students pursuing PhDs, undergraduate students, and high school students. It supported cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional training of an early career faculty member and collaborator from Central Connecticut State University (CCSU), who utilized the molecular biology experience available at Georgia Tech to develop a protocol for selection of membrane-permeable RNAs. The project supported two postdoctoral scholars, one a key collaborator who transitioned from postdoctoral scholar to the equivalent of Assistant Professor at the Institute of Chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem during the last year of the project. In addition, two research scientists, five PhD students, one research staff member, seven undergraduates, and two high school students were supported for a least two person months. All trainees participated in project and research group meetings.
Undergraduate participants trained under the Enriched Undergraduate Research Experience (EURE). In the first and second years, undergraduates from CCSU resided at Georgia Tech, working in lab daily though a lab exchange program. Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars mentored undergraduates, and undergraduates helped to guide high school students. To the extent possible, undergraduates were integrated into the schedule and extracurriculars of the greater NSF-funded REU infrastructure in Georgia Tech’s College of Sciences. The infrastructure includes development of a research pitch and written research proposal, a final written report, and oral and poster presentations, as well as a variety of training opportunities and social events. In the terminal year (which was held predominantly remotely) of EURE, a student-led journal club specific to EURE was added. Students worked together remotely to deliver a group presentation of papers relevant to their research projects.

"Several significant periods in human biological and cultural evolution have been correlated with changes in diet. The oral microbiome, communities of bacteria living in the human mouth, can also be influenced by individual diet and may be another indication of how human evolution has been shaped by dietary transitions. This project examines the link between human diet and the oral microbiome by collaborating with an indigenous community who have lived along the Northwest Coast of North America for over 6,000 years. This collaboration will allow the researchers to reconstruct the oral microbiome of an ancient community adapted to a predominantly marine diet, and assess how significant social and cultural transitions associated with dietary changes, such as European colonization, may have influenced the oral microbiome. The research will inform our understanding of the relationship between human evolutionary history and modern human experiences, such as the health disparities documented in many indigenous communities of North America. This project will also incorporate community-based projects like the development of an Ancestor ""House"" room to respectfully store indigenous human remains awaiting laboratory analysis.

This project draws on both Western science research methods and indigenous community knowledge and oral history. The researchers will first reconstruct the diet and oral microbiome of the ancestral indigenous community using a combination of cutting edge ancient DNA sequencing methods, stable isotope analysis, and oral history. Prior to European contact, this ancient community underwent a period of increasing social complexity, transitioning to villages with large, stratified, lineage-based, multigenerational households, which likely controlled local food resources. In non-egalitarian communities like this, there are often individual status differences. This research will assess how increased status differentiation and social complexity influenced individual diet and access to food resources, and how the bacteria in the oral cavity responded to these changes. The diet and oral microbiome of this ancient community will then be compared to similar data from the living descendant community to assess how their current diet may be different from that of their ancestors, as a result of European colonization and the introduction of Western industrialized processed foods, and to understand if this change has influenced the bacterial composition of the oral microbiome. This research will provide a novel approach to understanding the biological consequences of European colonization.",NSF,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,IL,31701,1732263,malhi@illinois.edu,Ripan,Malhi,1,"Over the past 6,000 years, the Coast Tsimshian experienced two significant periods of social transition: increasing social complexity during the transition from the Middle Pacific Period (3500-1500BP) to the Late Pacific Period (1500-500BP) and 19th century European contact with subsequent ongoing colonization and increasing industrialization. This project integrated genomic, isotopic, and osteological data with community-held knowledge from the descendant Metlakatla First Nation to investigate the relationship of these periods of sociocultural transition to diet and the composition of the oral microbiome within the ancestral and descendant Coast Tsimshian communities of British Columbia, Canada. In doing so, the study provided a much-needed characterization of the oral microbiome of an ancestral fisher-hunter-gatherer community, as well as a more comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary history of the human oral micorbiome in relation to the effects of European colonization on Indigenous peoples in North America.

Ancient DNA was successfully extracted and sequenced from the dental calculus of 45 Coast Tsimshian Ancestors who were previously excavated from two village sites near what is now Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada. The genomic sequence data from each Ancestor was analyzed for both ancient microbial DNA from the oral microbiome and ancient plant and animal DNA indicative of the individual's diet. Analyses to date of this genomic sequence data have identified several salmonid species in the diet of the ancestral community. Dietary change through time, between the ancestral and descendant Coast Tsimshian communities, was assessed using paired analyses of collagen from Ancestors' tooth root dentine and keratin from hair samples provided by descendant participants. DNA from oral gumline swabs of 17 descendant community participants was sequenced to compare to the Ancestors' oral microbiome data.

Existing research on the impact of dietary changes associated with industrialization on the human oral microbiome relies largely on comparisons of genetically unrelated communities, overlooking the possible effects of local evolutionary adaptive processes on the composition and function of the oral microbiome. The results of this innovative Ancestor-descendant comparison, made possible through a collaborative research relationship with the Metlakatla First Nation, suggest the microbiome of the ancestral Coast Tsimshian community, developed in assocation with a high-protein fisher-hunter-gatherer lifestyle, has been retained within the descendant community. The bacterial phyla Actinobacteria dominates the oral microbiome of both the ancestral and descendant communities, despite the reduced proportion of high-trophic marine protein measured in the diet of descendant community members. These findings highlight the potential role of traditional foods in suporting the biological resilience of Indigenous communities, as well as the importance of considering human oral microbiome research within local evolutionary contexts.

The project contributed to the training of a female Alaska Native scientist in molecular biology and genomic laboratory techniques, bioinformatics, statistical analyses, and community-based research methods.

"Early life experiences can have substantial influence on development and adult outcomes, and the mother is a crucial component of the early life environment for humans and other primates. Recently, researchers have begun to examine the complexities of maternal signals, how infants use these signals to navigate developmental trade-offs, and the impact of trade-off decisions. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the influence of maternal hormonal and behavioral signals on infant development in several groups of wild olive baboons living under different ecological conditions. The researcher will document variation in maternal signals, to develop a comprehensive model of infant development and provide insights into the evolution of human health and development. The project contributes to local community outreach programs and provides mentorship and research opportunities to undergraduate students, recent graduates, and local employees. The research team promotes diversity and inclusion in STEM through active involvement with professional organizations for marginalized identities and through workshops that address issues of sexual harassment in STEM.

The project will address three questions: What predicts variation in maternal signals, how do infants respond to maternal signals, and how do infants navigate developmental trade-offs? The study will capitalize on long-term ecological and demographic data for olive baboons and provide detailed behavioral, physiological, and growth data. The study will use photogrammetry to measure body size and growth trajectories, fecal samples to measure glucocorticoid levels in mothers and infants, and focal samples to obtain detailed information about nursing behavior, infant activity levels, and maternal responsiveness. The study will examine 40 mother-infant pairs over a 14-month period. The study site in Laikipia, Kenya provides the opportunity to compare animals that rely heavily on invasive Opuntia stricta fruits with animals that have limited access to these fruits. Variation in the availability of Opuntia fruit will provide insight into how high-sugar diets and predictable food availability -- traits that characterize recent changes in human diet -- influence maternal signals and infant responses. These results could potentially inform medical intervention practices that target infant health by indicating when interventions will be most effective and how long interventions are needed.",NSF,Arizona State University,AZ,20399,1732172,joansilk@gmail.com,Joan,Silk,1,"Early life experiences can have substantial influence on development and adult outcomes. Despite the importance of the maternal environment on offspring development and later health, we have only begun to examine the complexities of maternal signals, how infants use these signals to navigate developmental trade-offs, and the impact of trade-off decisions. This project investigated the influence of early life adversity on maternal glucocorticoid (GC) and behavioral signals, and the influence of these signals on infant behavior, growth, and physiology in wild olive baboons (Papio anubis). Specifically, we asked three questions: Does early life adversity explain variation in maternal signals? How do infants respond to maternal signals? How do infants navigate developmental trade-offs?

To examine these questions, we studied 48 mothers and 51 infants from a population of wild olive baboons in Laikipia, Kenya from October 2016 to December 2017. We used 3900 focal samples to obtain detailed information about maternal and infant behavior, 1844 fecal samples to measure glucocorticoid levels, and approximately 5000 photogrammetric samples to measure body size and growth trajectories. With access to long-term ecological and demographic data and detailed behavioral and physiological data, our project provides an ideal opportunity to link early life adversity to maternal investment and infant developmental trajectories.

Our results indicate that maternal behavior and GCs vary as a function of mothers’ early life experiences. We find evidence for a relationship between maternal behavior and GC levels, and preliminary analyses suggest that these maternal signals predict infant activity patterns. These results contribute to our understanding of how consequences of early life adversity can persist across generations. We will also analyze how maternal signals influence infant body growth and physiology, and the relationship between infant growth and infant activity patterns. By considering the maternal environment and multiple dimensions of development simultaneously, this research will create a comprehensive model of infant development and will provide insights into the evolution of human health, development, growth, behavior, and physiology.

This project is dedicated to community outreach and the promotion of diversity and inclusion in STEM fields. In Kenya, we provided financial and hands-on support for local schools, an eco-walk, and the Twala Cultural village for women. We had four female research assistants collecting data at the field site, trained a team of local Kenyan employees, and supervised a diverse group of undergraduate students through an apprenticeship program on campus. The Co-PI was also involved with the LGBTQQIAA diversity group of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists, worked to develop an organized network to support trans and nonbinary individuals in STEM, co-organized workshops to create positive culture change in the academic community, and led the effort to create a code of conduct for the field project. Funding from the National Science Foundation allowed us to engage in activities with broader impacts in addition to research with intellectual merit.

"This dissertation project is a biocultural investigation of iron deficiency and its connection to negative physiological outcomes in children living in multi-generational households where individuals experience both under- and overnutrition. Investigators will examine biological and ecological factors that influence child iron status, providing practical knowledge on determinants of iron deficiency and addressing the theory that low iron may be partially protective against infection. The research objectives and methods of this project will advance knowledge about human life history, and contribute to the discussion about why policies that aim to reduce iron deficiency and anemia are not always successful. This project will contribute to the education of a graduate student as well as provide training opportunities in anthropological and health sciences to a female community health worker. Investigators will distribute the results of this project through community workshops, meetings with local and national health agencies, and a series of peer-reviewed publications and presentations at anthropological, public health, and medical conferences. 

While low levels of iron are associated with negative health outcomes, iron withholding is an important component in immune defense against infectious disease. The Optimal Iron Hypothesis (OIH) states that an individual's optimal iron status is contingent on their particular disease ecology.  This project will test a new application of OIH in an area that suffers from the dual burden of over- and undernutrition. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, researchers will investigate the relationship between iron, infection, and malnutrition as well as examine household-level and biological predictors of current iron status. Investigators will employ interviews and observations to establish participant health histories, diet quality, and disease exposure in households. Researchers will also measure height and weight to establish nutrition status as well as gather data on iron status and infection through the collection and analysis of blood samples.",NSF,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,NC,25116,1731128,althomps@email.unc.edu,Amanda,Thompson,1,"Analyses from this study established predictors of childhood anemia and response to iron supplementation, explored the relationship between energetics and immune response, as well as identified the role of intestinal microbiota diversity on recovery from anemia in a sample of pre-school-aged chidlren living in a Peruvian peri-urban community. The associations identified between child growth patterns coupled with maternal perceptions of child body size, household composition, and ecological changes in season with iron status indicate the importance of including a focus on caregivers, household, and environment in addition to individual-level variables in studies of childhood anemia. While obesity has been shown to increase inflammation and decrease iron absorption, results from my study complicate this narrative.  Analyses show different patterns of iron absorption between children with high and low central adiposity and total body fat, this demonstrates how fat distribution can impact immune function and nutritional status. My work also identifies the intestinal microbiome as an underlying pathway linking nutritional deficiencies and disease ecology through observed differences in gut microbiota and taxa in pre- and post- iron supplementation samples, demonstrating the need to include gut health indicators in medical or nutritional interventions. 

In addition to furthering anthropological theories, this project provided training opportunities and education in anthropological and health science to a female community health worker in Lima, Peru. This health worker was trained in conducting semi-structured interviews, 24-hour dietary recalls, anthropometric assessments, and household observations as well as dried blood spot collection. At the conclusion of data analysis, the results of this project will be presented to the community at a health workshop sponsored by the local clinic as well as at a Peruvian Ministry of Health bimonthly anemia meeting, informing them of the relationship between iron deficiency, diet, the gut microbiome, and local household disease exposures. This project therefore has the potential to influence local and national iron supplementation policies and programs throughout Peru.

"The intergenerational consequences of prenatal stress and its impact on fetal development are of growing interest to biological anthropologists. However, the mechanisms by which maternal experiences are transmitted to their offspring are poorly understood, and most studies to date have focused on subclinical disorders in high-income settings. This doctoral dissertation project is a study of the intergenerational consequences of exposure to interpersonal violence among women and their developing offspring. Interpersonal violence remains a significant societal issue in many locations, and while many studies have examined the consequences for health and well-being across the life course, the enduring intergenerational effects remain under-investigated. Findings from this study will contribute to our understanding of the biological mechanisms that perpetuate the deleterious health consequences of violence to the next generation. This project will support graduate student training and mentoring, international research collaborations, K-12 science outreach activities, and inform public health and clinical research for maternal and child health.

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the biological mechanisms through which exposure to interpersonal violence impacts not only maternal biology but also fetal and infant development. Specifically, we will examine whether maternal exposure to interpersonal violence and psychosocial stressors impact offspring stress regulation, neurodevelopment, and DNA methylation patterns, in women and their infants in Brazil. We predict that maternal exposure to violence will be associated with increased hair cortisol concentrations during pregnancy, and for infants at one year of age, altered DNA methylation patterns and dysregulated diurnal cortisol patterns. The investigators will also take a mechanistic approach by investigating the mediating role of DNA methylation on infant diurnal cortisol rhythms. This study advances knowledge by focusing on methylation and hormonal changes occurring early in life, and by focusing on a contextually salient stressor, interpersonal violence.",NSF,Yale University,CT,11201,1731773,catherine.panter-brick@yale.edu,Catherine,Panter-Brick,1,"How does exposure to interpersonal violence ""get under the skin"" to influence maternal biology during pregnancy and produce long-term effects on newborn health and development? The goal of this study is to examine intergenerational and fetal programming effects of interpersonal violence and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activity during pregnancy in a high-risk population in S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the biological mechanisms through which exposure to interpersonal violence impacts not only maternal biology but also fetal and infant development. Data for this study was collected from a birth cohort of 80 high-risk pregnant women enrolled nurse home visit program focusing on parenting skills. Mothers were interviewed at 16- and 30-weeks of pregnancy and saliva was collected from infants when they reached 12-months of age.

 

My primary hypothesis is that maternal biology is sensitive to social experiences, such as interpersonal violence, and these experiences affect fetal biology and development. I tested this hypothesis by examining (1) if maternal exposure to violence was associated cortisol, a hormone thought to be associated with stress, (2) if exposure to violence and pregnancy cortisol was associated with methylation of infant DNA at 12-months, and (3) if such exposures were associated with infant cortisol production at 12-months of age.

 

The results of the analyses demonstrate that exposure to mothers? lifetime interpersonal violence is not directly associated with cortisol levels during pregnancy or infant methylation or cortisol at 12-months. However, maternal cortisol, specifically in late pregnancy, was associated with methylation of FKBP5, a gene known to regulate cortisol production. Exposure to violence during pregnancy was associated with increased infant evening cortisol. Measures of violence exposure were not associated with infant DNA methylation.

 

While exposure to violence seemed to have a limited direct effect on infant outcomes, it was associated with maternal mental health during pregnancy. Maternal anxiety in late pregnancy was associated with methylation of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene. OXTR methylation was associated with infant evening cortisol.

 

The results of this study demonstrate that maternal exposure to interpersonal violence has intergenerational consequences that affect offspring physiology. Trauma exposure may operate through other pathways, such as maternal mental health and wellbeing during pregnancy. These results and methods contribute to efforts to understand the mechanisms of prenatal stress. Additionally, they suggest that researchers should investigate pathways other than the HPA axis, such as the oxytocin system.

"Personality differences appear to have many influences on the social lives and relationships of humans. Given that an individual's relationships develop from social interactions with others, and that interactions can be stressful, an important question is how personality differences in the stress response influence social relationships. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate variation in stress response in a non-human primate model, with collection of behavioral and (non-invasive) hormonal data. Understanding how variation in coping with social stress affects the social lives of primates is important in light of growing evidence that the management of both stress and social relationships influences the mental and physical health of individuals (human and non-human). This project will provide laboratory research opportunities to Rutgers undergraduate students, particularly those from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields.  Science outreach and training in conservation, ecology, and wildlife management will be provided to local communities. The results of this project will be presented at institutions of higher learning with the goal of explaining the contributions of this research and of biological anthropology to society at large. 

This research will investigate how wild social primates, with naturally formed long-term relationships, individually differ in how they cope with stress. The olive baboon, more behaviorally and socially complex than most non-primate models, will provide comparative data for studying stress response variation in humans.  The investigator will collect behavioral and hormonal data and use network analysis to study aggression, grooming, and spatial proximity, and observe how individual baboons react to various stressful situations.  The results of this work will contribute knowledge about the maintenance of social relationships, the consequences of different types of stress coping, and how these variables interact with one another. These outcomes are important for understanding how certain individuals balance the problem of coping with stress with aspects of their social lives.",NSF,Rutgers University New Brunswick,NJ,25200,1732279,palombit@rci.rutgers.edu,Ryne,Palombit,1,"This doctoral dissertation research project collected data on wild social primates to answer a question that has been asked about both human and nonhuman animals: do inherent individual differences in the style of response to stress influence the kinds of social relationships an individual has?  If so, how? Additionally, this project aimed to address whether individuals who differed in their use of these intrinsic stress response styles also differed hormonally, that is, whether they had different levels of a type of hormone that is known to be associated with stress management?  This study utilized behavioral, non-invasive experimental, and hormonal sampling to collect data in two groups of wild olive baboons, naturally living in large social groups that are famous for the complex social relationships and strategies pursed by individuals. The final results of this 17 month field study are forthcoming as the behavioral data are currently being analyzed and the laboratory hormonal samples from the field are being processed. One anticipated outcome of the study will be to improve our understanding of complex biological processes involving stress, ""personality"" attributes, social life, and hormones in humans. Study of a non-human primate model, such as the baboon, is extremely helpful in facilitating this goal.  That is partly because the complexities and impacts of culture are much less pronounced in these animals, but at the same time, the similarities we share with these creatures&mdash;as primates&mdash;mean they potentially inform us about the fundamental biological processes at work. Explanations of human behavior must, of course, ultimately incorporate the crucially importantly cultural dimension, but a better understanding of this biological foundation is of prime importance.  The research will improve our understanding of how individuals balance coping with stress coping with their own social lives: what are the social costs and benefits of responding quickly and aggressively to stress situations, versus responding more slowly and thoughtfully? This project has provided training and research experience to three American undergraduates, as well as providing employment and skill development to six Kenyans, two of whom are now pursuing further University studies.

"Bipedalism (walking on two legs) is one of the earliest and most critical adaptions that separates humans from other mammals, but there is a lack of consensus about the type of locomotion that preceded it. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate and quantify the structural changes that took place in the ape heel as they relate to plantigrade (heel-striking) adaptations, a critical precursor to becoming bipedal. Locomotor and skeletal data from living animals will be analyzed to better understand the relationship between form and function in our primate and hominin ancestors. This research will contribute to improved science literacy and access within the general public through a combination of public talks, the use of social media to highlight new and engaging research, a commitment to publishing in open access journals, and by providing place-based learning opportunities to connect students living near field sites with local research objectives. This project will also support the mentoring and scientific training of female undergraduates at Dartmouth College and local high school students, as well as the career of a female graduate researcher in a field where women are underrepresented. 

This project tests the relationship between bone shape and behavior using a multifaceted approach. Kinematic walking data will be collected, using a plantar pressure mat, for semi-wild primates and comparative species, to describe differences in gait with and without plantigrady. Analyses will also include the use of geometric morphometrics and high definition micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging.  These data will be used to assess and interpret calcanei across the human lineage and Miocene primate fossil record. By reconstructing the locomotor capabilities of fossil primates, this research will test hypotheses about the polarity of plantigrady within the ape lineage, determine potential selection pressures driving the shift to plantigrady, and use plantigrade behavior to better understand phylogenetic relationships among the many Miocene ape genera and their relation to primates alive today. The project will contribute to our understanding of hominin bipedalism by revealing trends in the locomotor patterns observed just before the advent of the hominin lineage.",NSF,Dartmouth College,NH,21705,1730822,Jeremy.M.DeSilva@Dartmouth.edu,Jeremy,DeSilva,1,"Bipedalism (i.e., walking on two legs) is a defining feature of human?s and their early ancestor?s evolution. But, many questions still remain about the evolutionary timing, driving factors, and body form which preceded it. Plantigrady (i.e., heel-striking) is an important precursor to stable, upright bipedalism. However, little is currently known about the evolutionary history of plantigrade foot postures within apes. This project (Award #:1730822) sought to identify skeletal markers of plantigrady in the primate calcaneus with implications for understanding the foot postures of Miocene primates and bipedal evolution in Plio-Pleistocene hominins (i.e., species along the evolutionary branch to humans). This project combined multiple avenues of investigation, including locomotor data from extant primates and anatomical analyses of living species and fossil foot material, to test the form-function relationship between calcaneal anatomy and locomotor modes and provide the tools necessary to better interpret the primate foot fossil record.

            With the NSF funds, McNutt traveled to Uganda and South Africa, as well as within the United States to collect biomechanical walking data on four species of semi-wild primates and carnivores and compared them to data previously collected on modern humans. These data showed that there were distinct differences in the relative peak axial forces acting on the calcaneus depending on foot posture. Based on these force differences it was hypothesized that there should be an expansion of the proximal calcaneus, among other anatomical changes, to help mitigate these forces during walking. McNutt tested these hypotheses using a geometric morphometric study. Building off previously collected data and subsequent trips to both domestic and international museums, she collected 3D scans of 394 calcanei, across 16 genera of primates and carnivores. She found that these calcanei were consistent with proposed hypotheses relating anatomy and foot posture. These data were then used to categorize the foot posture of 22 preserved Miocene primate and eight Plio-Pleistocene hominin calcanei scanned at museums in Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, and Switzerland. These data suggest that the ancestral condition for ape foot posture is a mixed signal between monkey-like semi-digitigrady and gibbon-like semi-plantigrady, reflecting a greater degree of locomotor flexibility in these early generalized arboreal quadrupeds. In hominins, while there is some variation within foot posture, modern human-like full contact plantigrady is present by approximately 3 million years ago.

            More generally, these results help address several ongoing discussions within the field of biological anthropology about primate foot posture and locomotion. They answer questions about when great-ape like plantigrady appeared in the primate fossil record and lend support to models which predict that bipedalism began in a more arboreal context. Additionally, this project highlights the value of combining behavioral data from living organisms, particularly semi-wild individuals, with anatomical analyses of skeletal material within the same study for addressing complex questions about the primate fossil record.

            This award allowed McNutt to gain invaluable experience through travel to examine collections of fossil and comparative skeletal material; training to gain expertise in 3D scanning/printing technology, biomechanical data analysis, and geometric morphometrics; and building long term connections with both domestic and international collaborators. This award help McNutt secure a postdoctoral position and serves as the jumping off point for new and continuing research. The results of this study were presented, in part, at the 2019 annual meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropology and, in total, at the public defense of McNutt?s PhD in May 2019. This project will result in the submission of at least four publications to relevant peer-reviewed publications, including the Journal of Experimental Biology, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Journal of Physical Anthropology.

            Through this award McNutt was able to pursue her passion for spreading scientific awareness both as a mentor and educator. Over the course of this project, she assisted in the training of several female undergraduates in scientific techniques including: the use of 3D scanning technology, scan analysis software, and scan preparation for 3D printing. Additionally, one of the undergraduates was given the opportunity to assist in collection of locomotor data. This student learned how to collect and record biomechanical/behavioral data when working with semi-wild mammals in the field. The results of this project have been shared with the general public across multiple avenues. McNutt shared her work and expertise through visits with high school classrooms, appearances at science museums and on science podcasts, and through frequent outreach to younger kids through events intended to promote science literacy and interest. In addition, McNutt utilized social media outlets, like Facebook and Twitter, to discuss her experiences and findings throughout the project and used the opportunity to promote conservation and encourage wonder at the natural world. She continues to use social media to share her work.

"Comparative analyses of DNA and amino acid sequences is a powerful paradigm in biology, including evolution, ecology, development, and medicine. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software is a widely used tool to apply state-of-the-art methods for sequence analysis in these biological disciplines. MEGA provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to enable researchers to explore their primary data and results interactively, along with an integrated analytical engine that makes a large repertoire of evolutionary analysis methods easily accessible. MEGA is used by thousands of researchers in biology and has become a major teaching tool in universities worldwide. However, MEGA is primarily for use on Windows operating systems, which limits its utility and impact. The goal of this project is to (a) make MEGA cross-platform; (b) ready MEGA for community contributions and third-party expansion of functionalities; and (c) add a workflow GUI in MEGA to enable researchers to assemble pipelines and workflows that are becoming essential for rigorous, reproducible, and automated analytics in this era of big data. These developments will lead to a major enhancement of software infrastructure in biology and related interdisciplinary areas, all of which are critical in modern biological research. They will advance education through the development of tutorials, and benefit underserved populations through workshops and teaching. 

Comparative analyses of DNA and amino acid sequences, a powerful paradigm in computational biology, have grown and adapted to the changing needs of biological sciences. Due to its increasing analytical complexity, successful application of the comparative paradigm requires efficient, sophisticated, and intuitive software. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA, now in version 7) software is among the most widely used tools for sequence analysis, as it provides a powerful and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), giving researchers tools for exploring their data and visualizing results interactively, and placing a large repertoire of state-of-the-art evolutionary analysis methods at their fingertips. This ""Development"" proposal is to modernize and re-engineer MEGA using cutting edge software libraries and development philosophies. It will ensure that this vital community resource not only remains useful for the next decade, but also becomes cross-platform and extensible for community integration of new methods and tools. The project will leverage modern open source application development stacks and libraries, drawing upon web technologies (JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS) for a platform agnostic application, which will lead to an open source, cross-platform MEGA GUI that is ready for community contributions and third-party expansion of functionalities. It will also add a new workflow system (AppFlows) to enable researchers to assemble pipelines and workflows that are becoming essential for rigorous, reproducible, and automated analytics in this era of big data. The new AppDepot in MEGA will host add-ins and extensions (small and large) developed by community programmers by reusing MEGA-X components and core libraries. AppDepot will bridge the gap between computational/statistical method developers and biological users, as the large installed base of MEGA will immediately make new methods available to many to test and use. All of these results will be available from www.megasoftware.net .",NSF,Temple University,PA,998419,1661218,s.kumar@temple.edu,Sudhir,Kumar,1,"Analysis of DNA and amino acid sequences has become common in many fields in biological sciences. These analyses require computer software that is intuitive and efficient. The MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) software makes a large repertoire of state-of-the-art analytical methods available to researchers in a powerful and intuitive tool that enables data exploration and visualizations interactively. In this software-engineering project, we successfully transformed MEGA from a Windows-only software to one that is now available for use on macOS and Linux operating systems. The project also expanded the collection of analytical methods and made all methods more computationally efficient, allowing for bigger data analytics on a desktop computer. Major new and improved versions of MEGA were disseminated annually, with versions with minor updates released more frequently. During the grant period (2017-2021), MEGA was downloaded &gt;500,000 times by researchers from a very large number of institutions and countries. MEGA use was cited in more than &gt;60,000 research articles, spanning &gt;100 fields in biological sciences. The broader impact of MEGA in education was also extensive, as MEGA was downloaded over 1 million times by students. An expanded wider impact was realized through our teaching-related articles that introduced MEGA and related resources to K-12 and undergraduate students and teachers. Overall, this project led to major enhancements of software infrastructure in biology and related interdisciplinary areas, all of which are critical in modern biological research and education.

"Many models of primate behavior and evolution have relied heavily on the generally well-studied baboon genus. However, the relatively understudied Kinda baboon exhibits unique physical and social traits compared to other baboon species, suggestion a wider variety of reproductive strategies that should be considered in baboon models.  This project will collect new data on the Kinda baboon to understand the evolution of their unusual biology, facilitating future comparative studies into the evolution of mating system diversity among primates including our own hominin lineage. This project will facilitate the training of graduate and undergraduate students in multiple aspects of research including field data collection and processing, computational methods, and laboratory work. The project will support international research collaborations, science outreach to students and local communities, conservation efforts, and data dissemination through various media. 

Kinda are the only baboon species for which we lack detailed biological data, and are an excellent species on which to test predictions of evolutionary models in primatology. Kinda baboons have a unique suite of characteristics, including reduced sexual dimorphism and male-driven intersexual social relationships, suggesting that baboons exhibit more variation in their reproductive strategies than previously thought. This project will test the hypothesis that compared to other baboons, Kinda baboons evolved traits indicative of weaker direct, and stronger indirect, male-male competition. This project has two major objectives, to: 1) characterize the mating system and types of reproductive competition observed in a population of Kinda baboons; and 2) characterize the consequences of these characteristics for female sexual signaling. We will achieve this through: i) the characterization of female reproductive life-history; ii) hormonal assessment of reproductive profiles; iii) the calculation of female reproductive synchrony and male reproductive skew; and iv) the reliability of female sexual signals in advertising female fertility. Since data on these parameters exist for other baboon populations, we will be able to compare our results to those of other baboon taxa. This project will result in the first detailed longitudinal dataset on wild Kinda baboon reproduction, particularly in relation to physiology and sexual signaling. The project will facilitate future comparative studies into the evolution of mating system diversity among primates and other animals. Further, exploring the behavioral and life-history correlates of reduced sexual dimorphism, a characteristic observed in Kinda baboons and also in hominins, will provide important insights into the evolution of hominin reproductive strategies and the selective pressures leading to the derived suite of modern human traits.",NSF,New York University,NY,25186,1732321,jhigham@nyu.edu,James,Higham,1,"Biological anthropology seeks to understand diversity by focusing on the timeline for human evolution. Our closest living relatives, the primates, provide us with the opportunity to study how evolution has shaped present-day variation in traits that do not fossilize, allowing us to infer how different evolutionary mechanisms might have influenced the unique suite of human characteristics. The evolution of female reproductive strategies, in particular, have been proposed within this framework. By characterizing variation in reproductive strategies within the primates, we are able to develop testable theoretical models to understand the correlates and evolution of divergent traits. Problems persist however, in accurately testing model predictions, which are best tested on species for which we have almost no data.

This project focused on the fascinating but little-known Kinda baboon, the only species for which we lacked detailed data on their biology, and the best baboon species on which to test evolutionary models of female reproduction. Our study had two main objectives: 1) characterize the mating system and types of reproductive competition observed in a population of Kinda baboons; and 2) characterize the consequences of these characteristics for female sexual signaling.

To address our objectives, we combined eight years of long-term data with one year of short-term data on a wild population of Kinda baboons. For the long-term data, we analyzed seasonality of the environment and female reproduction; characterized male dominance rank acquisition; and genotyped the entire population to determine longitudinal patterns of paternity. For the short-term data, we intensively monitored 12 sexually-active adult females on a daily basis and collected 1200 observations hours on social and sexual interactions, 450 fecal samples for hormone analyses, and 7000 photographs of sexual swellings. Following data collection, we analyzed fecal samples for female reproductive hormones to determine the timing of ovulation and the fertile-phase from 45 total menstrual cycles. We used computational analyses to determine the size and shape of sexual swelling.

We found that Kinda baboons exhibit more seasonal patterns of reproduction (births and mating) due to living in a more seasonal environment. We discovered that male Kinda baboons exhibit queueing rather than contest-based dominance acquisition, characterized by long alpha male tenure lengths. We are currently determining if these patterns have led to a decrease in male reproductive skew. Further, we found that the female Kinda baboon sexual signaling system is a less accurate indicator of fertility than what is observed in other baboon species.

 

Intellectual Merit

This project has not only provided important new data on a little-known species, but will facilitate future comparative studies into the evolution of mating system diversity among primates, including humans. Compared to other large mammals, many primates are unique with regards to female sexuality and reproduction: female morphology and behavior is not restricted to strict periods of estrus, females are able to mate with multiple partners and express mate choice, and females often exhibit sexual traits (only seen in males in other mammals). A broad knowledge of female reproductive biology across the primates, our closest-living relatives, is important as it allows us to put our own understanding of human female reproduction into evolutionary context. Human evolution is characterized by a decrease in sexual dimorphism, an increase in male investment in male-female relationships, and a loss of obvious sexual traits advertising fertility. Kinda baboons appear to share a similar evolutionary path, so understanding behavioral and physiological correlates of these shared traits may help us to reconstruct the evolution of human female reproductive strategies.

Broader Impacts

This research project provided training to the graduate student co-PI in project management, international and national collaboration, mentorship, outreach, field and laboratory methodology, computational, and statistical analysis. This project facilitated the training of four high schoolers in the US from under-represented backgrounds in science field in research and presentation skills, and multiple undergraduates in laboratory and computational analyses. In Zambia, this project contributed towards the long-term sustainability of the only research site on the Kinda baboon and facilitated training opportunities with Zambians in field and laboratory methodologies and educational training and development of community-based conservation initiatives. It has also led to a long-term collaboration between US and Zambian researchers and universities. The results of this project have been disseminated to local Zambian stakeholders, presented at national and international scientific conferences, published in scientific journals, and featured in popular magazines.

"Bone is a dynamic tissue that changes through the lifespan. This dissertation research will combine markers of bone turnover with measures of bone density to understand how bone varies with physical activity and life history. The project seeks to understand the slow change in bone density and the processes that maintain bone turnover, in two related populations with different lifestyles. In addition to data on estrogen and physical activity levels, the co-PI will collect information on age at menarche, number of offspring, and duration of breastfeeding, which are life history traits that can vary with energy availability and stress levels, reflect changing estrogen concentrations, and may correlate with bone characteristics. Combining data on past conditions and current lifestyle factors in this comparative context will expand our understanding bone health through the lifecourse in adult women. The project will also promote international collaborations, student training and mentoring, and public science outreach activities. 

This project builds upon previous work in life history and human reproductive ecology and applies these approaches to analyses of bone health. Using these paradigms for interpreting female reproductive endocrinology in ecological and evolutionary contexts, this research focuses on bone as a product of the hormonal, energetic, and mechanical demands of the human female across the lifespan. Integrating the bone-related effects of physical activity across multiple physiological systems is important because they do not operate independently of one another. By comparing physical activity levels, current estrogen concentrations, and life history variables between Polish women and second and third generation Polish-American women, this research will test hypotheses about the ways in which life history, physical activity, and the estrogen-mediated interactions between these variables affect bone density and turnover in healthy adult women. This work extends the life history concept of resource allocation to include bone maintenance as one of the tradeoffs between growth, maintenance, and reproduction. Additionally, it contributes to broader anthropological discussions regarding health effects of demographic transitions to sedentary industrialized lifestyles.",NSF,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,IL,31720,1732117,kclancy@illinois.edu,Kathryn,Clancy,1,"Over the past 2.5 years, I?ve been able to collect data for an extended field season in rural Poland, develop and test new multiplex assays to allow for analysis of our biological samples, and start to analyze and present my results to my peers.

The major goal of this project is to understand the slowly changing state of bone (density) and the physiological processes which maintain that state (bone turnover) in two related populations of healthy adult women with different lifestyles, focusing on the effects of estrogen and physical activity. My aims were:

 

Aim 1: Assess how differences in life history during skeletal development affect variation in adult bone health.

Aim 2: Assess the extent to which the variation in bone health can be explained by current physical activity patterns, energetic status, and current reproductive status.

Aim 3: Integrate key life history factors (Aim 1) with current physical activity, energetic, and reproductive measures (Aim 2) to test how interactions of these variables affect bone health.

 

The project has succeeded in collecting life history data, blood and urine samples to measure bone turnover, urine samples for hormone analysis for a full menstrual cycle, physical activity data, and ultrasound measures of bone density. My labwork is almost complete, and I have begun analyses on life history data and physical activity data.

My preliminary results, presented at the 2019 American Association of Physical Anthropology annual meeting, show that bone density in the rural Polish women is much higher than expected for white women of European descent (Figure 1), and suggests biomechanical pressures may play a larger role than life history factors in shaping this skeletal phenotype (Figure 2). Furthermore, I have published a short report (doi: 10.1002/ajhb.23231) which shows that these women spend a lot of time physically active at low intensity and walk a relatively high number of daily steps (measured with accelerometers, Figure 3).

I managed to secure additional funding to allow for completing the hormone analyses, and expect to incorporate those results into my dissertation, defending during Winter/Spring 2020. Additionally, this funding has allowed me to collect enough data to allow for me to train and mentor multiple undergraduate students, so far resulting in three undergraduate Research Initiative projects (research poster presentations prepared by 1st year undergraduates), and two Undergraduate Honors Theses (research poster, oral presentation, and thesis completed at end of a student?s senior year). We plan to develop at least one of the Honors Theses into a manuscript for publication.

"Chemical bonds between phosphorus and oxygen are important in building DNA and RNA, and also in supplying modern cells with energy. It is not known, however, whether the first life forms had the same chemistry, and early life in particular may have run on sulfur instead of phosphorus. This project will work backwards from the traces of this sulfur-based chemistry in modern life to reconstruct the role of sulfur-oxygen bonds in early ecosystems. Predictions made from this approach will be compared to the carbon and sulfur isotope record in  >2.5 billion year old rocks. We will use the astrobiology social media platform (SAGANet) for the conversations with public about this project and other studies of evolution of life on Earth.  
 
Phosphate esters, such as nucleotide triphosphates, diphosphates, and pyrophosphate, are the central component of energy metabolism in all living cells. It is not known, however, whether they were of similar paramount importance at the origin of life or in the first cells, or whether another kind of chemistry was playing the same role there. Considerations from geochemistry, molecular evolution, and systems biology imply that thioesters - high-energy bonds based on sulfur instead of phosphorus - may have supplied energy in the first metabolisms on Earth. This project will develop a broad and detailed understanding of the natural history of thioester utilization, working backwards to reconstruct ancient biochemistry from contemporary metabolism, and simultaneously examining pre-biological chemistries that can couple thioester formation and degradation. These two lines of study will allow the research team to infer the carbon and sulfur isotopic signatures of important metabolic pathways in a putative early thiobiosphere, and test whether these signatures are preserved in the >2.5 billion year old geological record. The results of this project should be of broad interest, and the project will engage with the scientific community and the public through journal publications as well as an established astrobiology social media platform (SAGANet). Select high school serving communities traditionally underrepresented in science will be reached through semester-long programs led by SAGANet graduate student mentors and facilitated by the investigators of this project.",NSF,Trustees of Boston University,MA,384373,1724150,dsegre@bu.edu,Daniel,Segre,1,"Metabolism, the network of biochemical reactions essential to all living cells, plays a major role in the organization of ecosystems, and is tightly coupled to the chemical history of our planet. In fact, the structure of metabolism in present-day cells harbors a memory of its rise from abiotic chemical systems, and can therefore help understand the early steps of the origin of life. Our major contribution to this project has been the use of systems biology approaches, originally developed for the quantitative analysis of metabolism, to help understand the rise of organzed biochemical networks from geochemistry. We focused in particular on understanding whether and how a primordial metabolism could have relied on energy currency based on sulfur-based (thioester) chemistry, rather than phosphate-based chemistry. Phosphate is present in numerous biomolecules, including ATP and nucleic acids, but it is geochemically scarce and poorly accessible, often serving as the limiting nutrient in modern ecosystems. It has been proposed that, in absence of phosphate, thioesters could have served as the main energy transfer molecules in prebiotic evolution. By computationally simulating the expansion of metabolism from an initial set of simple compounds (including hydrogen sulfide, ammonium and acetate), we found evidence for a primordial phosphate-independent sub-network consisting of 315 reactions and 260 metabolites. We discovered that reactions in this core network are enriched with features characteristic of proposed models of proto-metabolism, and rely strongly on transition metal and iron-sulfur coenzymes, supporting the possibility that this network may constitute a ?metabolic fossil? of early life. We next extended our approach to systematically compute the possible structures of proto-metabolism under multiple combinations of boundary conditions, including temperature, pH, redox potential and availability of key molecular precursors. Our analysis of possible trajectories indicated that a subset of boundary conditions converges to an organo-sulfur-based proto-metabolic network fuelled by a thioester- and redox-driven variant of the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle that is capable of producing lipids and keto acids. We used one of these networks to build a steady-state dynamical metabolic model of a protocell, and found that different combinations of carbon sources and electron donors can support the continuous production of a minimal ancient ?biomass? composed of putative early biopolymers and fatty acids. Finally, we started exploring how our knowledge of metabolism as we know it today may bias our understanding of early metabolic processes. We addressed this challenge through two distinct avenues: first, we explored the thermodynamic landscape of biological and non-biological redox reactions involving linear chain molecules with a fixed number of carbon atoms. Specifically, upon constructing the energy landscape for the full chemical space as a function of pH and electron donor potential, we found that over a large range of conditions metabolites tend to have lower Gibbs energies than non-biological molecules. Second, we used artificial chemistries, in silico representations of chemical reaction networks arising from a defined set of mathematical rules, to explore alternative chemical universes and the possible metabolic networks that could emerge within them. In particular, borrowing tools from the field of stoichiometric constraint-based modeling of organismal metabolic networks, we developed a novel Python package, ARtificial CHemistry NEtwork Toolbox (ARCHNET), freely available online. We envisage that future effort in trying to understand early life will increasingly benefit from the quantitative approaches developed for systems biology of metabolism. Origin of life research should continue embracing theory and modeling as essential tools for transforming data and hypotheses into testable predictions.

"The ""Biofilm Resource and Information Database (BRaID)"" project is a collaboration between the Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE) at Montana State University, Bozeman, MT and the Gianforte School of Computing at MSU and the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR), Santa Fe, NM. Biofilms are microbial communities that have important impacts on water quality, food production, energy-making processes, and various aspects of human and animal health. BRaID serves as a community resource, containing both data and the metadata (where or how data was collected, processed, and interpreted).  Some examples of metadata include: a geographical location, such as the Bozeman Water Reclamation Facility; microenvironments such as water chemistry; environmental factors such as changes in temperature, perturbations such as adding corrosion inhibitors; and interventions such as antibiotic treatments. BRaID has utility to a broad range of stakeholders in basic and applied research, as such it is expected to enhance the competitiveness of US industry, basic research, and defense, as well as assist with advancements in human health, environmental health, and energy production. Outreach activities will include (1) dissemination of research outcomes to local community members and industry stakeholders at conferences and legislator engagements; (2) involvement of underrepresented Native American students from high schools and tribal colleges in summer research activities as well as undergraduate researchers at MSU-Bozeman; and (3) educational activities in undergraduate and graduate courses at MSU, as well as summer internship, outreach and training activities at the NCGR.

Awareness of the importance of microbial biofilms - microorganisms growing as aggregates attached to surfaces, interfaces, or each other - has exploded in the past decade. Diverse microbial communities grow as biofilms in such settings as dental plaque, heart valves, natural watercourses, wastewater treatment processes, cooling systems, oil and gas pipelines, and persistent infections. Biofilms can have significant impacts on human health, industrial productivity, and natural resources, spanning natural, engineered, and medical systems. Despite the importance of biofilms, there is no public web portal and database dedicated to storage, analysis, and communication of biofilm-specific data. Part of the reason for this is the sheer breadth of data types used to describe biofilms, including nucleotide sequences, images, video, chemistry (water, surface, and extracellular polymer matrix), remediation history, clinical outcomes, and geospatial data. BRaID will complement existing microbial databases by developing a data representation paradigm that solves the problems posed by the challenge arising from the unique combination of data, and will implement new metrics and algorithms for the formal description and analysis of biofilms data. This project aims to provide the premier resource that offers users the ability to ask complex questions (including those currently impossible to answer), permitting quantitative comparisons among biofilms, supporting remediation efforts, and enabling predictions about outcomes. Results of the project can be found at: http://ncgr.org/braid.",NSF,Montana State University,MT,299853,1661530,dmillman@gmail.com,David,Millman,1,"The ""Biofilm Resource and Information Database (BRaID)"", was a collaboration between the Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE) at Montana State University, the Gianforte School of Computing at Montana State University, the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR), and DePaul University, leaders in their respective fields. 

 
BRaID is a system that serves as a community resource to provide tools, including a biofilm-specific ontology that can describe not only DNA data, but also rich information about biofilms such as geography, environments, water chemistry, environmental parameters, perturbations and interventions (e.g., changes in temperature, addition of corrosion inhibitors, and antibiotic treatments).

 
Microcopy is a central tool for studying biofilms.  As part of the BRaID project, we developed tools for managing and analyzing microscopy data.  In particular, we focused on managing and tracking the metadata related to the imaging process and developing algorithms for labeling image pixels for additional analysis.

 
Another research topic that was supported by BRaID was to advance basic algorithms for a common step in biological research, RNA sequencing.  Briefly, this problem tries to quantify which genes are ""on"" within a tissue sample and if there are different forms of the gene being expressed.  The problem can be viewed abstractly using something called a flow network, and one of the results of this project was to create a new algorithm that can use additional information from new sequencing technologies such as long read data.

 
The basic research supported by BRaID has had several broader impacts including training graduate students, dissemination of research results and broadening interest in basic science research to undergraduates, including a summer research experience.

"This research is designed to engage public participation in data collection and the development of a stream discharge, stream temperature, and aquatic species habitat forecasting model. Through the use of citizen-based observations of stream height and stream temperature, this approach will demonstrate how citizen-derived observations can contribute to forecasts of stream discharge, stream temperature, and identification of freshwater fish habitat. Freshwater fishes have significant ecological, economic, and recreational importance across the United States. However, freshwater species are among the most endangered groups of organisms in North America, largely due to the impact of human activities. Accurate representations of freshwater species habitat are needed to develop approaches to balance the needs of society with the conservation of freshwater resources. This can be accomplished through the collection of observed data by government and research organizations or by computer modeling of habitat, whereby the quality of the model depends upon the availability of observed data. However, the amount of observed data for freshwater systems has been declining due to decreases in funding. The data that do exist are generally focused on large rivers that are important for urban communities (i.e., flooding, water supply), which are locations not always relevant to freshwater species whose habitat often occurs in smaller headwater streams. Local communities of recreational users and their mobile phones offer an opportunity to close this data-availability gap through citizen science. As regular users of shared resources, like streams and waterways, outdoor enthusiasts have valuable knowledge of specific locations. This knowledge is vastly underutilized by scientific communities. This project will harness information and data collected by members of local communities and develop an approach for data collection, storage, and integration with computer models that can predict streamflow, stream temperature, and freshwater species habitat, which can then aid in sustainable management of these resources. The Boyne River Basin in Michigan, USA will be used as a test location, but the techniques can be used in watersheds throughout the world. 

The goal of this research is to develop techniques that integrate citizen science hydrology and stream temperature data with eco-hydrological models. Specifically, this research is designed to fully couple citizen participation in the development of a real-time stream discharge, temperature, and aquatic species habitat forecasting model framework. The project will install CrowdHydrology (a citizen science network that collects hydrologic data) equipment throughout the Boyne River Basin. The local community can then text (via cellphone) stream level and stream temperature data to the CrowdHydrology platform. These citizen science data will then be transformed and input into an eco-hydrological model for near real-time simulations of streamflow, stream temperature, and aquatic species habitat. This approach will demonstrate how citizen-derived observations can contribute to the modeling of stream discharge, stream temperature, and aquatic species habitat. The model simulations and forecasts (one week ahead), including stream flows, temperatures, and habitat distributions, will be presented in tables and simple spatial plots available for download on the CrowdHydrology website (http://www.crowdhydrology.com)",NSF,Indiana University,IN,384948,1661156,dficklin@indiana.edu,Darren,Ficklin,1,"Ongoing human impacts on freshwater systems have resulted in aquatic organisms becoming among the most threatened components of biodiversity in North America. To reduce these impacts and preserve freshwater resources, accurate representations of these habitats are needed. Local community members that use these resources for fishing, boating, and other recreational and economic activities can be important contributors to our understanding of these systems through their contributions of data as citizen scientists. The research project titled, 'Improving high performance super computer aquatic ecosystem models with the integration of real-time citizen science data,' resulted in the development of a new method for using citizen science observations to help forecast stream flow, stream temperature, and trout habitat in the Boyne River watershed in northern Michigan. This research used a novel monitoring network of digital thermometers and depth measurement sticks placed within a stream, which had a simple sign attached asking passers-by to text message the stream temperature and water level to us (Figure 1; see citizen science data collection site figure).  These citizen science observations sent via smartphone were processed on a super computer at Indiana University (Figure 2; see project workflow figure), and then used to develop predictions of stream flow and water temperature throughout the watershed. To our knowledge, this is the first time that citizen science data have been used as a primary source to forecast stream flow and water temperature. The advances of using this method are that every time new citizen science data are added, via text message, the model improves the prediction of stream flow and water temperature, thus building a collaborative community of citizen and professional scientists. A major objective of this research was to produce a scientific product that was useful to both professional scientists, the local community, and wider audiences. To address this objective, multiple community meetings were set up to gain feedback from the local stakeholders as to how stream flow and water temperature forecasts may be helpful. Discussions during these meetings were analyzed and resulted in new methods being used to incentivize participation and revisions to how model outputs were visualized. The online forecasting tool is fully operational and able to integrate seven-day forecasts of precipitation and air temperature to predict future stream flows (Figure 3; see stream flow forecast figure) and water temperatures (Figure 4; see water temperature forecast figure). Because this process has been automated, these forecasts can be produced and accessed into the future even though the project is completed (https://nsfboyne.sitehost.iu.edu/). Using the stream flow and water temperature forecasts, estimates of regions of the stream that will be suitable for cold-water fish species are also available (Figure 5; see trout habitat forecast figure); our community partners called this the 'fish happiness' maps. The process described above is considered data assimilation, where different types of data, in this case citizen science data, can be integrated to help support the protection of habitats and public recreation. This research highlights the opportunities that exist in harnessing the power of citizen scientists to help collect data that can be used to protect freshwater resources, the species that live in these systems, and the habitats that are economically and recreationally important to local communities. The hope is that this type of research can close the loop between citizen and professional scientists to address important ecosystem related research questions.

"Understanding how gene by environment interactions result in specific phenotypes is a core goal of modern biology and has real-world impacts on such things as crop management. Developing and managing successful crop practices is a goal that is fundamentally tied to our national food security. By applying novel computational visual analytical methods, this project seeks to identify and unravel the complex web of interactions linking genotypes, environments and phenotypes. These methods will first need to be designed and developed into usable software applications that can handle large volumes of crop phenomics data. High-throughput sensing technologies collect large volumes of field data for many plant traits, such as flowering time, related to crop development and production. The maize cultivars used here come from multiple genotypes that have been grown under a variety of environmental conditions, in order to give the widest range of conditions for understanding the interactions. The resulting data sets are growing quickly, both in size and complexity, but the analytical tools needed to extract knowledge and catalyze scientific discoveries have significantly lagged behind. The methodologies to be developed in this project represent a systematic attempt at bridging this rapidly widening divide. The project is inherently interdisciplinary, involving close research partnerships among computer scientists, plant scientists, and mathematicians. The research outcomes will be tightly integrated with education using a multipronged approach that includes, among others, postdoctoral and student training (graduates and undergraduates), curriculum development for a new campus-wide interdisciplinary undergraduate degree in Data Analytics, conference tutorials for training phenomics data practitioners, and contribution to the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities (particularly women) in STEM fields through the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.


This project will lead to the design and development of a new, scalable, visual analytics platform suitable for hypothesis extraction and refinement from complex phenomics data sets. Focus on hypothesis extraction is critical in the context of phenomics data sets because much of the high-throughput sensing data being generated in crop fields are generated in the absence of specifically formulated hypotheses. Extracting plausible hypotheses from the data represents an important but tedious task. To this end, this project will apply and develop new capabilities using emerging advanced algorithmic principles, particularly from the branch of mathematics called algebraic topology that studies shapes and structure of complex data. The research objectives are three-fold. First, the project will employ and extend emerging algorithmic techniques from algebraic topology to decode the structure of large, complex phenomics data. Second, an interactive visual analytic platform will be developed to facilitate knowledge discovery using the extracted topological structures. Lastly, the quality and validity of a new visual analytic platform designed by this team will be tested using real-world maize data sets as well as simulated inputs as testbeds. The developed framework will encode functions for scientists to delineate hypotheses of three kinds: i) genetic characterization of single complex traits; ii) genetic characterization of multiple traits that share potentially pleiotropic effects; and iii) decoding and detailed characterization of genotype-by-environmental interactions, in particular, through a collaborative pilot study of maize flowering and growth traits. The expected significance of the proposed work is that biologists will be able to extract different types of testable hypotheses from plant phenomics data sets by employing a new class of visual analytic tools, and thus obtain a deeper understanding of the interactions among genotypes, environments and phenotypes. The project is potentially transformative in two ways: i) it will introduce advanced mathematical and computational principles into mainstream phenomic data analysis; and ii) it will usher in a new era where biologists spearhead data-driven hypothesis extraction and discovery with the aid of interactive, informative, and intuitive tools. The project will have a direct impact on the state of software in phenomics for fundamental data-driven discovery. To facilitate broader community adoption, the project will integrate the tools into the CyVerse Institute, and to a community phenomics software outlet. It will also lead to the development of automated scientific workflows. Project website: http://tdaphenomics.eecs.wsu.edu/",NSF,Washington State University,WA,761428,1661348,ananth@eecs.wsu.edu,Anantharaman,Kalyanaraman,1,"The project represents the first concrete demonstration of topological data analysis for plant phenomics data. Topological data analysis is one of the emerging mathematical principles with a wide range of real-world applications. The project was able to successfully demonstrate how topological data analysis can be used to analyze plant phenomics data sets and help in extracting different types of hypotheses relating to how different genotypes (crop varieties) interact with various environmental variables (e.g., temperature, humidity) to effect certain key phenotypic traits (e.g., plant height, growth rate). The project also demonstrated, through application on real-world data sets, that this interaction is not all the same, and that there is tremendous diversity in the way to different genotypes interact with different environmental variables.

 

From a computational standpoint, the project’s developments contributed to the mathematical and algorithmic foundations in topological data analysis, including in data modeling, feature extraction, hypothesis formulation, and interactive visualization. It created an open source software toolkit for complex multi-dimensional data sets that have become a feature in multiple data-driven domains.

 

The project led to the training of multiple graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdocs, on various interdisciplinary topics at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and biology and life sciences.

"Many significant hominin and archaeological sites represent complex, mosaic paleoenvironments that require high spatial resolution to be properly characterized.  This study presents a new approach to fine-scale environmental reconstruction at these sites using tooth microwear in rodents, which have small home ranges and are found in abundance in different habitats.  The project will collect data on rodent dental microwear, and will combine microwear analysis with ongoing and independent rodent ecological research. These analyses will result in a detailed association of microwear texture patterns with diet and environmental data that will help us better reconstruct paleohabitats using fossil rodent teeth. This award provides research support to a female graduate student from an EPSCoR state.  It also provides research opportunities for undergraduates and fosters international collaboration between the University of Arkansas and the National Museum of South Africa.

Research on rodent dental microwear textures has been limited because of a lack of information about habitat or diet for specific individuals in a study sample. This project will attempt to address this problem by associating incisor and molar microwear texture patterns with stomach contents of those same individuals, as well as their documented habitat floral composition and atmospheric dust load. The project focuses on three core questions: (1) Will individual differences in diet be reflected in differences in molar microwear textures? (2) What effect does habitat openness and associated dust level have on incisor microwear? and (3) Do incisor and molar microwear patterns reflect the floral composition and dust loads of rodent microhabitats?  The co-PI will study rodents from an on-going environmental assessment project at the Kolomela Mine in the Central Free State of South Africa to answer these questions.  She will obtain information on the dust levels and floral composition at each rodent capture site.  Diet details will be derived through stomach content analysis of each specimen.  These data will then be associated with standard quantitative descriptors that result from incisor and molar dental microwear texture analysis.",NSF,University of Arkansas,AR,19477,1731554,pungar@uark.edu,Peter,Ungar,1,"The reconstruction of past environments is an important step in understanding how humans and their ancestors have adapted to climate changes in the past.  There are many studies and methods already directed towards this endeavor, but environments are by no means simple.  Therefore, it is important to understand all aspects of the ecological context in which our species evolved, from the big picture to all the small nuances that comprise a given region.

This project focused on developing rodent dental microwear as a proxy for paleoenvironmental reconstruction.  An animal?s diet can serve as a proxy for environmental reconstruction because foods eaten tend to reflect availability in a given habitat.  Dental microwear, the microscopic markings that develop on the surface of teeth during use, allows for the interpretation of these diets in fossilized specimens.  Specifically applying this technique to rodents should allow for inference to be made that will focus on the microhabitats of these past environments.  Still, before rodent dental microwear can be used in comparison studies with fossil sites, it?s important to have a detailed baseline with known attributes with which one can work.

To accomplish this task, the co-PI worked with researchers from the National Museum in Bloemfontein, South Africa to access rodent specimens previously trapped for an ongoing environmental impact study at the Kolomela Mine in the Northern Cape of South Africa.  The diets of approximately 214 individual rodents representing eight species were documented through dissections of their stomachs.  Molds were taken of the corresponding incisors and molars for dental microwear analysis at the University of Arkansas.  In addition, we were given access to data collected as part of the bigger impact monitoring at Kolomela, including that of plant compositions, grit levels, and climatic conditions.  Preliminary results of the stomach contents show that all rodent species throughout the mine and associated area possess diets mostly comprised of plant material.  How this corresponds to the microwear patterns is yet to be determined, as work on the dental microwear analysis is still ongoing for both the incisors and molars. 

The funds provided for this project provided the co-PI with the opportunity to dissect the stomachs of the different rodent specimens, as well as collect corresponding molar and incisor impressions and generate microwear texture data for comparisons.  Many rodent species tend to be very flexible in what they?ll eat, making it difficult to rely solely on details from previous publications for diet data and thus emphasizing the need for such first-hand documentation. The co-PI will be using all data collected from this project in her dissertation.  She also plans on publishing these articles in the appropriate journals, as well as present results at the 2019 American Association of Physical Anthropologists annual meetings.

"People and societies thrive best when they understand how the social and physical dynamics of their environment work, allowing them to respond appropriately.  Natural scientists have built our understanding of the physical world. The scientific understanding they built has contributed to the development of technologies and practices that benefit human economies. For example, genetic sequencing of DNA enables deeper understanding of biological organisms; the consequences for human health, food production, understanding of evolutionary adaptation, etc. have been revolutionary and are still unfolding. The DNA sequence is the blueprint for an organism's anatomical structure (morphology) and function, but images capturing morphology are now much less prevalent than genetic data. Museums and researchers have been creating 3D digital images of natural history collections, and there are extensive 3D image data sets for some model organisms, but these data are mostly in closed collections, and generally unavailable or very difficult to access. This project aims to provide infrastructure to increase the accessibility of anatomical information, with a focus on 3D images. The resource will create the first open access, web-enabled image archive accepting and serving high-resolution, 3D scans of all organisms, called MorphoSource. Standardized descriptive tags will allow scientists to use this database to easily combine genetic and anatomical datasets for the first time, supporting the formulation of novel research questions. MorphoSource will link to other databases (such as iDigBio [www.idigbio.org]) that aggregate information on museum specimens from around the world. Having a shared common resource will change the culture among researchers and museums, making collaborations between physically distant experts more feasible, but it will also open the linked research collections of museums to anyone with Internet access anywhere in the world.  Large data sets are prerequisites for many statistical and machine learning methods, so the resource will enable innovations in computational image analysis methods, fostering new types of collaborations that advance field-wide scientific understanding. The resource will track data use, enhancing reproducibility and also providing an objective metric of the value of individual data elements. Open access to the data linked through MorphoSource will enable anyone with Internet access to see the detailed anatomical evidence for theories like evolution.  Pilot work has shown that teachers and students eagerly consume this newly available information, with numbers already in the thousands.  Positive results of this access include (1) providing a more intuitive type of raw data (compared to DNA sequence) for showing the public why some conclusions about evolutionary relationships were reached, (2) providing an 'interest metric' for the value of natural history museums and the collections they hold, (3) increasing the community of people (including citizen scientists) who have access to the data required to make important discoveries by studying biological variation. 

The specific plan for creating the repository for 3D data on all organisms is as follows. The primary goal is to restructure and improve a proof of concept database called MorphoSource. The restructuring will allow MorphoSource to meet the needs of a growing community of researchers and educators through massive upscaling, and to implement a novel approach for economically preserving data for the long term. To accomplish this, the MorphoSource server will be rebuilt to use the Fedora digital asset management architecture, which has been developed by library scientists to serve emerging needs related to the archiving and sharing of digital data. As part of this architecture upgrade, the data hosted on MorphoSource will be given an additional layer of protection through managing asynchronous copies in DuraCloud, a digital data preservation platform that leverages Amazon cloud. This restructuring will allow the MorphoSource server architecture to be integrated with the Duke University Libraries repository infrastructure. MorphoSource will also be able to invite institutional communities to be consortium partners in support of data storage and to enact data preservation techniques that guarantee integrity and readability for the foreseeable future. Additional tools will (1) allow for rapid, automated ingestion of dozens to hundreds of datasets at once, (2) link MorphoSource with major biodiversity archives, and (3) provide in-browser visualization of 3D series of image slices, such as those generated by CT and MRI scanners.  The plan includes ingesting thousands of high quality legacy CT datasets from published studies, enabling their reuse, increasing the repeatability of studies. The project leaders plan to directly work with and design tools for K-12 educators and students to help them benefit from this resource. These datasets and educational tools will be available to researchers and the public through the updated MorphoSource website, available at www.morphosource.org.",NSF,Duke University,NC,1410460,1661386,doug.boyer@duke.edu,Douglas,Boyer,1,"Data repositories designed for genetic sequences have existed for decades (i.e. Genbank was founded in 1982). These repositories have revolutionized biological sciences and profoundly magnified the impact of biology on society. Rich data on genetically-programmed anatomical structures are also critical for advancing biological science. The richest sources of information on anatomy are typically preserved cadavers, plant structures, or bones and fossils in museum collections. 3D digital data representing anatomy includes surface geometry/color/texture from photogrammetry, structured light scanners, or laser scanners; or internal volume data from CT/MRI devices. However, there were no open repositories specialized for 3D data representing anatomical aspects of phenome until 2013, when Duke University founded MorphoSource.org. 

In 2017, after MorphoSource had developed a substantial user-base and 3D data holdings, NSF funded Duke to develop MorphoSource into a more scalable and sustainable platform (DBI-1661386).

In February 2021, the primary goal of this award was achieved (Figure 1): launching MorphoSource 2.0, a completely new site version, rebuilt using new software with new features. The original LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack was refactored using digital preservation architecture based on Hyrax, Samvera, and Fedora Commons (an open, increasingly adopted standard for digital preservation among library and information science communities). As part of the refactor, we added a modernized front end and greatly expanded the repository’s scope, modifying its data model to support greater diversity in 3D resources and data creation workflows.

During the award period, MorphoSource provided support to the ""oVert"" Thematic Collection Network (TCN) grant (DBI-1701714). This network, with 17 collaborating museums and 41 PIs, aims to create and upload CT scans of 20,000 species representing 85% of vertebrate diversity. The data contributions in the MorphoSource project titled ""oVert Thematic Collection Network"" are still rapidly growing. To help mass-scanning initiatives we developed user-facing batch-upload routines. We also added features for museum integration. We coordinated with iDigBio to build a manifest-based system of packaging machine-readable data reports. The data reports, delivered via RSS, have native compatibility with GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkits. These reports allow museums to regularly publish lists of MorphoSource 3D data representing their specimens to iDigBio and GBIF. We also released an API that collections databases, including Specify (and soon Arctos), query to show museums data on their specimens in MorphoSource. Since initiation of oVert TCN in 2017, nine ""oVert Partner to Existing Network"" grants have been awarded and MorphoSource is providing the primary data mobilization role for these as well. Further, querying NSF grant numbers cited by MS data objects returns at least 196 NSF awards.

The value of DBI-1661386 is highlighted by the profound impact MorphoSource has had on fields like evolutionary/comparative biology, paleontology, and biological anthropology. In the four years since the project began, over 1,000 peer reviewed papers utilizing MorphoSource have been published, with increasing numbers of papers published every year (Figure 2). These papers span a huge taxonomic diversity (Figure 3). Increasing use is also reflected by data download rates (Figure 4). Various factors likely explain the increasing utilization. It can be explained in part by growth of holdings in the repository, which makes it more broadly useful for new research. Since 2016, the data holdings have grown from 15,000 data objects to 150,000. These datasets now represent anatomy from 3 kingdoms, 9 phyla, 29 classes, and 16,000 species of organisms (a 20-fold increase from 2016). Pandemic restrictions have spiked demand for MS datasets. Beyond pandemic related spikes in use, increases in download rates are also correlated with the launch of MS 2.0 with enhanced search/discovery functions. Finally, we think increasing use can be explained to an important degree by shifting attitudes in stakeholder communities for 3D data. These shifts have strengthened expectations and willingness for archiving 3D data. In an anonymous survey of users, answers to an open-ended question for any negative or positive feedback strongly supported this perspective on how MS is shifting the culture of data archiving/sharing (Figure 5).

Another goal of this grant was to increase the ability of people of all backgrounds to engage with and benefit from MS. A major outcome supporting this goal is an HTML-embeddable, 3D visualization and annotation tool that displays automatically-generated, lightweight derivatives of volumes and colorized, textured meshes that can be displayed on almost any computer's browser (Figure 6). In fact, MorphoSource is currently the only open platform where users can browse for and interact with accurate renderings of CT scans contributed directly by the scholarly community. Projections from current trends and plans for building new capacity suggest that MS will continue increasing its impact over the next 5 years, likely adding at least 300,000 additional datasets and supporting at least 2,200 additional publications.  We are also excited to further enhance depth of interaction on the site with even better annotation support and VR/AR features.

The ability to analyze complex anatomical structure and accurately characterize morphological form has produced significant insights into a variety of important questions in the biological and life sciences, biological anthropology, paleontology, and associated disciplines. The overarching goal of this project was to develop a sustainable open-access repository to allow researchers to archive and share 3D anatomical and morphological data derived from a variety of imaging and scanning modalities including 3D laser and light surface scanning, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.

The portion of the project at Penn State was primarily focused on processing and uploading a large number of legacy datasets collected from a variety of past funded research projects, supporting the development efforts at Duke by assisting with the improvement of the user experience, and public engagement via Twitter, video tutorials, and educational outreach. The work on legacy datasets focused on both 3D x-ray computed tomography data and 3D surface meshes representing a variety of species. Over the course of the project, more than 4600 datasets from over 2700 individual specimens were processed and uploaded to MorphoSource. The datasets represent a diverse range of organisms including invertebrates, fish, and mammals. These datasets uniquely include large samples of model organisms - 2318 CT image and 3D mesh datasets from 933 baboon skulls and microCT scans of the skulls of 1168 selectively bred mice. These specific datasets derive from past NSF-funded studies of craniofacial variation and represent rich resources to explore mammalian form, function, and variation, especially in combination with associated published genetic and pedigree information. Also processed and deposited in MorphoSource were microCT scan datasets representing twelve genera of the highly diverse and important cichlids of Lake Malawi collected over the past 30+ years. A large number of high-resolution microCT datasets from primate limb bones as well as important bioarchaeological materials were also processed and archived in Morphosource as part of this project.

This project had several important broader impacts including making valuable research resources widely available to the scientific community and general public, providing training opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers, and developing educational outreach and professional development opportunities for pre-college educators. As part of the project, a large number of important and scientifically useful datasets were processed and made available on the Morphosource platform. These datasets are now openly available for researchers and the general public for a variety of uses. A diverse group of students and researchers received valuable training opportunities including three undergraduate students, five graduate students, and two postdoctoral scholars. Additionally, two professional development outreach workshops were hosted through Penn State’s Department of Anthropology and the Center for Science and the Schools for pre-college educators. These week-long workshops provided intensive training and professional development opportunities for middle and high school teachers to learn novel approaches for implementing methods-based science education in the classroom using openly available digital data. In total 15 teachers participated from four different states. Finally, this project produced a large sample of computed tomography image data and new methods to process and analyze x-ray based image data that will have impacts in scientific fields beyond anthropology.

"Many wildlife populations exhibit massive fluctuations in numbers across different habitats and through time. Among the most remarkable of these are the 10-year cycles, synchronized across all or parts of continents, shown by some mammal species in the northern hemisphere. Understanding the mechanisms that create and dampen these cycles, and synchronize them across a species' range, can illuminate the fundamental processes that influence population dynamics of wild species. Snowshoe hares exhibit classic 10-year population cycles across their northern range in Canada and Alaska, but in the southern part of their range (the northern continental U.S.) the cycles are thought to dampen or disappear, possibly due to habitat fragmentation and climate change. This project extends a long-term study of snowshoe hares across the western US and Canada to determine whether cycles are dampened in the lower 48 states, the role that climate change and habitat fragmentation play in cycle dampening, and the role that animal movement plays in synchronizing population dynamics across large spatial scales. The resulting data will both improve our understanding of a fundamental natural phenomenon and test hypotheses about the effects of human-caused changes on wildlife population dynamics.

Results from this project continue to garner widespread interest among policymakers, forest managers, and the general public, as they have direct implications for recovery of the threatened Canada lynx, a specialist predator on hares. More broadly, results will examine how forest fragmentation and climate change affect population dynamics across continental scales. The project will foster strong collaborations with hundreds of citizen scientists and involve dozens of undergraduate and graduate students and international scientists in the research. The lead investigator will present at least 2 invited lectures or discussions per year to state and federal agencies, and the research will continue to attract attention from diverse media outlets.",NSF,University of Montana,MT,326742,1743871,scott.mills@umontana.edu,L.

The key focal species -- snowshoe hares -- is a high profile species to the public, the main prey of a Federally Threatened species (Canada lynx), and a scientific poster child for understanding drivers of dramatic 10-year population cycles. The overall project included two closely related 5-year LTREB projects.  

                The decadal LTREB research plan extended to 20 years the PI's snowshoe hare population dynamic studies in &gt; 35 sites in the Western U.S., creating the most spatially and temporally extensive and intensive time series of snowshoe hare dynamics in the U.S. (&gt; 2,000 hares captured).   Coupled with novel computational population models and genomic assays, both at the focal study sites and across the hare?s range, the field data led to several key findings: a) heterogeneity in forest stand structure -- driven by both natural forest-meadow patchiness and by forest harvest practices ? is sufficient to dampen snowshoe hare cycles in the southern part of their range (essentially, south of the US/Canada border); b) historic and ongoing breaks in hare movement and gene flow resulted in 3 genetically different groups of snowshoe hares in the Northern Boreal, Pacific Northwest, and Rockies; d) novel patch based approaches to silviculture can greatly reduce negative effects of logging on snowshoe hares (and the Canada Lynx), while still accomplishing the silvicultural goals of increasing tree growth and yield; c) hares have some scope for accommodating stressors through behavioral shifts, although there are firm limits to the breadth of such plasticity.

  Importantly, these field studies, complemented by genetic and computational tools, led to the serendipitous discovery that the hare's annual color molt from brown to winter white as camouflage against seasonal snow is severely compromised by the global trend of decreasing number of days with snow on the ground.  Camouflage mismatched hares suffer higher mortality, sufficient to drive future population declines.  These discoveries have established seasonal coat color mismatch (occurring in 21 diverse mammal and bird species worldwide) as a charismatic model system both for interdisciplinary research into the scope for local adaptive rescue in a changing world, and for compelling outreach to policymakers and the general public.

     Thus, the research funded by this award has been interdisciplinary and collaborative in nature, and served as a platform providing experiential learning, science mentoring of students, practical science-based recommendations to improve land and wildlife management, and public outreach. As a measure of interdisciplinarity and collaborative scientific output: publications from this project have been numerous, highly cited, and included &gt;70 coauthors across two dozen universities and at least nine countries.  My teams have included &gt;75 undergraduate and 6 graduate students. Further, this LTREB project has provided specific management recommendations for recovery planning for Threatened Canada lynx (Lynx Canadensis). These practical insights from our research include: a) how novel logging practices could maintain hare (and lynx) densities; and b) new ways for managers to rigorously estimate hare densities at large scales using hare pellets and DNA based individual genotypes coupled with cutting edge statistical capture-recapture models.  Our work also engaged a broad community of &gt;100 biologists, trappers, hunters, naturalists and other citizen scientists in research outcomes (eg collection of samples for our genetic analysis, time series for our population analyses.  Finally, although this award did not support work outside U.S., the work has fostered collaborative international relationships in Portugal, Austria, Scotland, Sweden, and Bhutan.

"When interpreting the effect of changes in genome sequences on their protein products, what are the criteria for separating the beneficial from the neutral and destructive mutations? It is not practical to experimentally test all possible changes; it is possible to develop computational rules and methods to accurately predict the effect of most changes, reserving experimental testing for borderline cases. The rules that constrain functional protein sequences, the structures into which they fold, the stability of the structures and the transitions that occur can be organized into an informatics framework that helps distinguish functional from non-functional mutations. The stability and dynamic transitions of protein structures over many mutations are the focus of this research, for which new evaluation methods will be developed and tested. Once the assessment methodologies are validated they will be integrated, along with the raw data and assessment results, within a single, efficient computational platform. The ability to interpret new data and compare it to existing results will not only allow discrimination of beneficial, neutral and deleterious mutations, but provides a resource for a protein-sequence-structure-based understanding of evolution. Informed selection rules will enable better decisions about the importance of saving individual members of endangered species, as well as how different environments affect selection in individual species. 

There is a large body of data in protein sequences and structures that can aid in understanding evolution, which is not currently being used. This project will utilize this data in systematic ways to shed new light on evolution.  Protein structures are often modeled in different computational ways; the evaluation of these structure models is critical for expanding the set of reliable structures, since there are huge numbers of possible mutant sequences. Changes to the protein sequences and structures are not fully understood. Part of the difficulty lies in understanding the interactions within their densely packed structures, which have significant interdependences.  Developing new ways to evaluate the effects of dense packing on protein structures is one of the project?s aims. Focusing on the physically interacting clusters within protein structures together with their sequence variants provides rich information about the correlations among amino acid substitutions. This rich data will then significantly advance the ability to distinguish between the important and the unimportant mutations. Progress has been seen with these approaches in the evaluations of predicted structure models at the CASP competitions for protein structure prediction.  These new approaches lend themselves directly to the evaluation of the stabilities of different protein mutants. The evaluation procedures are derived directly from the available sets of protein structures and carefully tested against other known structures. In one important innovation these now include entropies that account for known changes in the structures of individual proteins, i.e. their dynamics.  Capturing these tendencies for changes significantly improves the evaluation of the stabilities of proteins.   Applications to sets of mutants show that unfavorable mutants are either more stable or less stable than the normal cases.  These changes in stability directly affect the ways in which the proteins can move to carry out their functions; evaluating these changes significantly aids the understanding of protein mutations.  This project will yield a uniform way to reliably assess the effects of protein mutations.  This ability will significantly aid in the understanding of many aspects of evolution that remain.",NSF,Iowa State University,IA,883059,1661391,jernigan@iastate.edu,Robert,Jernigan,1,"In this project we have developed several new methods to investigate and understand how structures of proteins relate to the effects that mutations have on function.  We have investigated changes in packing density, stability, and dynamics arising from changes in the sequences of globular proteins.  There is a hierarchy in terms of what the changes from mutations are:  few mutations actually change structures, more cause changes to stability, and many more affect the dynamics. The effects on dynamics can be quite different with some introducing additional freedom resulting in less coherent motions, and others packing more tightly causing them to stick together and no longer move as they did originally. The results demonstrate how changes in packing density can directly cause changes to the intrinsic motions of a structure, which are usually essential for its function.   Some examples of these effects are provided in the attached images. A deeper understanding of these effects requires further studies on packing effects in proteins.

The distribution of packing density across a protein structure is critical for determining its dynamics. Densely packed parts are like rocks with no internal motion; whereas less densely packed regions are often the sites of hinge and other motions.  We have published a number of papers on this subject and have also deposited modular software on GitHub from this project - PACKing and Motion ANalysis (PACKMAN) [https://github.com/Pranavkhade/PACKMAN], which is an open-source software package written in Python (www.python.org). The package hosts code used in several published and submitted publications and webservers. It has an object-oriented environment to enhance further development. PACKMAN includes a well-written molecular structure parser called ?molecule? that allows any user to read, manipulate and write the molecular structures without any prior expertise in Python. Other modules such as Anisotropic Network Model (ANM), ?Geometry,? and other utilities help users create protein dynamics related apps easily. The tutorials for this are at https://py-packman.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/main.html#tutorials-main . This software has already had 22,613 (09/23/2021) downloads on PyPI (https://pepy.tech/project/py-packman.

One outcome will be our better ability to monitor bird populations and their migration systems, and the impacts of various environmental factors. The US network of weather radars has recorded a comprehensive 20-year archive of images of the atmosphere, which provides the baseline information about bird movements. Extracting biological information from the images is not automated currently, making it very slow and inefficient. A team of ecologists and computer scientists will conduct novel research combining methods in computer vision and machine learning to unlock detailed information about bird migration from the entire US archive of weather radar data. The resulting dataset will be freely available, providing an information resource for researchers to estimate the number of birds migrating on any given night, measure the patterns and trends of bird populations, and do hypothesis driven science. The research will advance big data analysis and visualization techniques for large-scale science questions, and will engage scientists, conservation planners, students, and the general public with data, visualizations, and educational material about bird migration.

Dark Ecology will leverage large-scale cloud computing and develop novel computer vision, machine learning, and radar analysis methods to measure the densities and velocities of migrating birds across the US. Deep convolutional networks will be trained to discriminate migrating birds from precipitation and other clutter in the radar data. New techniques for domain transfer and weakly supervised training will enable the training of convolutional networks with only modest-sized training sets. Gaussian process (GP) models will be developed to create smooth national maps of migration density and velocity. Novel GP methods and cloud-computing workflows will allow us to scale to massive radar data sets and analyze the more then 200 million archived radar scans. The resulting data and tools will be curated with open access policies, and used by the research team to conduct ecological research about patterns and drivers of continent-scale migration.

The project used these measurements to conduct hypothesis-driven scientific analyses of the patterns and drivers of bird migration at a continental scale. A central product of these efforts are daily bird migration maps and forecasts. These are published online in association with interactive tools for visualizing and understanding migration patterns and trends. These maps are the first of their kind and display real-time analyses of nocturnal migration intensity across the contiguous US. 

The project developed a deep learning model to extract bird migration measurements from the network of 143 weather surveillance radar stations located across the contiguous US. The model removes precipitation from radar data while preserving roughly 96% of the bird migration signal. The project completed a biological analysis of &gt;99% of all historical US radar data. The results summarize bird migration activity by elevation and represents the first full biological analysis of the US radar archive. The project created an open data set of historical bird migration activity from every radar scan from 1995 to 2018.

The scientific products generated by the project have contributed to the applications of machine learning in the analysis of massive data sets and have allowed scientists to explore central questions in avian migration ecology and conservation. This includes three landmark studies applied to radar-based estimates of nocturnal migration activity within the contiguous US. The first used radar data to document declines in migration activity, the second documented shifts in the timing of bird migration, and the third developed a bird migration forecast system to model the intensity of bird migration across the continent. All three represent major advancements in how we understand, study, and model the patterns and drivers of seasonal bird migration, with critical insights on the long-term implications of global change for migratory bird populations.

The real-time migration maps and forecasts generated by the project have broad applications reducing bird mortality through collisions with illuminated buildings, airplanes, and wind turbines. These products also provide an exciting platform to engage and educate the public on bird ecology and conservation. In total, the outcomes from the project represent significant conceptual and empirical advancements that touch on multiple scientific disciplines whose products will benefit research, education, and conservation for years to come.

"With support from the Advances in Biological Informatics in the Division of Biological Infrastructure, Professor Bryan Carstens and his research group at the Ohio State University will further develop the P2M2 software package, so that it can better estimate how multiple events may shape population genetics. Most of the differences among living organisms ultimately can be traced to genetic variation, including humans. Patterns of genetic differences in a species appear across different groups, due to events such as changes in population size, migration between populations, or long periods of isolation. Understanding, for example, how beneficial mutations can be established in a natural population of a certain size that has migration limits is important for understanding aspects of human health, conservation genetics, breeding in agriculture and many other research areas.  Recent technological advances have made it fast and inexpensive to obtain genetic sequences from many individuals, assuming samples can be collected. A number of software packages provide models that estimate what prior events looked like from current genetic data, including biological parameters such as population size or migration rate. However, each assumes a particular mathematic model of population demography and are limited to estimating parameters from a subset of the biological processes that may influence genetic variation. A poor match between the assumptions of the analytical model and the true population history will produce inaccurate parameter estimates that are likely to mislead the biological inference. This project will develop software that enables biologists to assess how appropriate a particular software package is to a given set of genetic data. Therefore, it will benefit society by improving the quality of biological inferences drawn from genetic data, ranging from efforts to protect endangered species to investigations into the history of viral pathogens.

Bayesian inference is commonly used to analyze genetic data because it provides a computationally efficient approach to identifying highly-probable regions of parameter space, but all such inference is conditional on the models chosen to use in the analysis. While analytical models exist that can estimate parameters associated with all population-level biological processes, such as genetic drift, phylogenetic divergence, gene flow, population size change, etc., computational limitations prevent any given analytical model of incorporating more than a handful of these processes. Biologists typically choose which analytical method to use intuitively, and generally lack approaches for assessing the absolute statistical fit of a model given the genetic data. Consequently, the inferences that result from the analysis of genetic data are effectively conditional on the appropriateness of the model used to analyze the data, although they are rarely presented in such terms. The proposed work will develop and implement a considerable expansion of the P2C2M R package, which currently implements posterior predictive simulation to assess the statistical fit of a single model - the multispecies coalescent model. The work will expand P2C2M such that the statistical fit of additional coalescent methods can be evaluated. By expanding P2C2M, the work promotes the consideration of model fit as an important step within the overall process of making biological inferences from genetic data. Biologists have devoted a great deal of energy to justify the models that they use to analyze their data using verbal reasoning and qualitative arguments, but have generally lacked the tools and statistical framework to do so in a direct quantitative manner. P2C2M will provide these tools by the time of project completion. As a direct consequence of the expanded P2C2M R package, the inferences made by evolutionary geneticists will be more insightful and because researchers and their audiences will have enhanced confidence in the choice of analytical models from which these inferences are derived. The work will enhance biological inferences with important societal benefit, such as the identification of cryptic species, understanding the demography of invasive species and disease vectors, and the movement of alleles across the landscape in endangered species. Updated project code will be available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/P2C2M/index.html and other supplemental information distributed at https://carstenslab.osu.edu/.",NSF,Ohio State University,OH,403649,1661029,carstens.12@osu.edu,Bryan,Carstens,1,"This project was concerned with understanding how biologists can best assess the statistical models that they use to analyze genetic data. While this may seem estoteric, genetic data form the basis for many biological inferences that are of practical importance, for example about species identification, the history of invasive species, and pathogen transmission. Because these analyses have potential real-world consequences, biologists need to be able to verify that the statistical model that they have chosen to do the data analysis is appropriate for the data that they are analyzing. This project explored a general strategy for conducting this verification known as posterior predictive simulation, and developed specific applications for different types of questions. We also established that certain questions are inherently challenging to this approach.

Much of the work conducted here involved statistical modelling and software development. In addition to the talks and papers that we produced for an audience of other scientists, there were multiple people trained as a function of this work. Some of these scientists are now in other academic positions as postdoctoral researchers or tenure track faculty, while others are in positions at hospitals or working for non-governmental conservation organizations. Regardless of their placement, the advanced training received by the personnel on this award represents an inherent benefit to society. Below some main outcomes are discussed:

1. One of the main outcomes of this project was the development of software that is intended to apply to certain types of use cases where biologists analyze genetic data. For example, genetic data are often applied to the question of species boundaries in groups where species are difficult to identify in visual ways. The P2C2M-GMYC R package offers an efficient protocol for verifying that the properties of the data are appropriate for this type of analysis. 

2. A second outcome was the development of a different R package, P2C2M SNAPP, which allows users to explore whether a phylogenetic model is appropriate to use for their data. This question is relevant because often times researchers are not able to identify species boundaries, and as such do not know whether their samples represent many populations within a widespread species or multiple independent species. 

3. A third type of outcome is synthesis of knowledge. The project also resulted in synthetic work that was intended to report on aspects of this project that did not directly result in software packages. For example, a manuscript published in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution summarized many findings for a technical audience and speculated on venues that future work might explore (i.g., https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(21)00342-6).

"An award has been made to coordinate and evaluate the first Southeast Regional PULSE (SERP) Institute, which will be held on the campus of the University of Richmond from June 18-22, 2014. The Institute promotes the mission of the Partnership for Undergraduate Life Science Education (PULSE) to stimulate whole departments to undertake the type of transformative changes recommended in the report Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action (AAAS, 2011), so as to promote student learning of core concepts and competencies, improve student retention in the sciences, and produce more curious and scientifically literate citizens. In September 2012, the PULSE founders from HHMI, NIGMS, and NSF appointed 40 Vision and Change Leadership Fellows to pursue this mission, and the SERP Institute will be coordinated by the 14 PULSE Fellows located in the Southeast.

The current award funds the first Southeast PULSE Regional (SERP) Institute, which will host teams from up to 20 colleges and universities, with at least 30% from minority-serving institutions. The SERP Institute will begin with institutional teams conducting a departmental self-assessment using the STEM Department Evaluation Rubric developed by the Leadership Fellows, and participants will plan their attendance at subsequent workshops based on the areas they identify as unfamiliar and/or high priority for improvement. Each team's administrator will be encouraged to attend sessions led by administrators who have supported reform, and these leaders will share advice, successful strategies, and ways to overcome common obstacles. Prior to departure from the Institute, each team will develop an action plan to target improvements in their program for the next academic year and beyond. The project's assessment plan, developed in partnership with the American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS), will include feedback on the structure and function of the Institute as well as evaluation of each team's progress based on data collected before, during and after the SERP Institute. Teams will also be encouraged to use particular assessment tools to evaluate student learning outcomes and dispositions as well as changes in faculty teaching practices and attitudes. Each team will provide an update on their progress during a poster discussion session at the annual meeting of the Association of Southeastern Biologists (which occurs ten months after the Institute), and the southeast PULSE Fellows will present the results of this project at the annual Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACS-COC) Conference, the AAC&U STEM Conference, disciplinary conferences, a publication in CBE-Life Sciences Education, and via the http://www.pulsecommunity.org website.

This project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/.",NSF,Florida Atlantic University,FL,27765,1723614,egoldey@fau.edu,Ellen,Goldey,0,"The overarching goal of the Southeast Regional PULSE (SERP) Project has been to engage entire departments in undertaking the types of reform called for in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (2011).   There were four (4) main objectives of the SERP Project: 1) to be inclusive, so that the work would touch diverse faculty and students at all institution types across the southeast, 2) to focus the attention of departments on ten (10) research-based factors known to improve student outcomes and faculty efficacy, 3) to maintain a collaborative and supportive network that encouraged departments to follow through on their Action Plans, originally conceived during one of two, four-day SERP Summer Institutes, and 4) to assess the SERP Project through analysis of surveys, interviews, Action Plans, and poster presentations in order to determine the impacts of the SERP Project on departmental reform.

Thus, the Project?s Intellectual Merit has been to inspire entire departments to adopt evidence-based practices in undergraduate biology education. The inclusive and supportive nature of the Project has ensured its Broader Impacts.  Assessment evidence shows that hundreds of faculty members and well-over 20,000 undergraduates, representing the full range of the region's rich diversity, have been impacted by SERP-inspired reforms.  In addition, although the focus of the Project has been on life science departments, the impact has extended to other STEM and non-STEM departments, and several participating institutions have been successful in using what they learned in the SERP Project to secure funding from NSF, HHMI, or other sources.

To encourage broad, inclusive, and diverse participation, schools from across the southeast region were invited to apply to attend each SERP Institute, and funds from this NSF EAGER award covered the costs of attendance at the Institute.  Schools of each Carnegie Classification type were selected randomly from the list of schools accredited by SACS-COC, and the US Department of Education's list of Minority Serving Institutions was also used to ensure that at least 30% of the seventy (70) SERP Institute invitations went to MSIs. From the applications received, twenty (20) institutions were accepted to the first SERP Institute, and eighteen (18) were accepted to the second. Of the thirty-eight (38) participating institutions, twelve (31%) are MSIs. For several departments, it was their first time to participate in such a program.  Teams from each institution consisted of two faculty members from the life sciences department, the department Chair, and an upper administrator with the authority to support the department?s reform work at home (Figure 1). 

The ten (10) research-based factors targeted for improvement were introduced to participants via the STEM Department Evaluation Rubric, which was created to teach users about topics often unfamiliar to scientists, thus quickly building a common vocabulary among its users to support subsequent discussions about departmental strengths, weaknesses, and priorities for improvement.  The Rubric?s ten topics, which formed the basis of most of the workshops (Figure 2) and plenary sessions at the SERP Institutes, are:

Developing students higher-order cognitive skills
Building students? metacognitive awareness and skills 
Developing students? core competencies
Increasing access to independent, mentored research
Adopting engaging, student-centered pedagogies
Providing faculty development opportunities and incentives
Using assessment evidence to guide ongoing department improvement
Building a change-receptive culture
Integrating department goals with Gen Ed and Institutional mission


Additional session topics included strategies for mapping a department?s curriculum to the core concepts and competencies in Vision and Change, creating inclusive classroom environments, leveraging SACS-COC accreditation requirements to stimulate positive departmental change, how to apply for NSF funding, and building faculty leadership to guide department-wide reform. 

Each Institute team developed an Action Plan, which they shared with other teams prior to departing the Institute (Figure 3).   Based on Action Plans and post-institute surveys, the most common priorities for improvement were: developing students? metacognitive abilities, integrating research into coursework, using engaging pedagogies, building students? higher-order cognitive skills, and increasing faculty development opportunities. 

The Association of Southeastern Biologists (ASB) was an important partner in the SERP Project.  The annual meeting of ASB occurred approximately ten (10) months after each SERP Institute, and the meeting provided the venue for SERP team representatives to report on their department?s progress since the Institute.  Thirty-six (36) of the thirty-eight (38) institutions presented posters on their department?s progress at one or more ASB meetings (Figure 4).

As of November 2017, the department Chair (or designee) from twenty-eight (28) of the thirty-eight (38) participating departments completed the SERP Project?s final survey.  Figure 5 summarizes the reported progress of teams on six (6) topics, and Figure 6 details the total numbers of facutly and students that department leaders report have been impacted by initiatives inspired by the SERP Project.

"Humans have many unique adaptations among primates, including the hallmark feature of bipedalism (walking on two legs) that shapes the way we move and how we design our built environment. The origins of bipedalism, including selective pressures and developmental changes that led to bipedalism, are not well understood. This dissertation project investigates the role of spine development in primates and mammals to better understand the way that spine evolution led to bipedalism. Project data will be used to expand and create museum exhibits about the origins of hominid bipedalism and evolutionary developmental biology in the Penn State Matson Museum of Anthropology. Science outreach activities will also be conducted through Penn State's Center for Science in the Schools, to bring STEM research experiences to underserved K-12 student populations.  The project will also support training and mentoring of female undergraduate students in anthropological and developmental laboratory techniques, and provide opportunities for these students to present at conferences and co-author papers.

The thoracolumbar spine is crucial for understanding primate evolution and the origins and unique adoption of human bipedalism. Both great apes and humans have stabilized their spine with the posterior shift of the transitional vertebra and reduction of non-ribbed lumbar vertebra. There is debate regarding whether these features are homologous or homoplastic, and thus whether bipedalism evolved from a short stiff back like great apes or a longer lumbar column more similar to monkeys and Miocene hominoids. The investigators propose to compare the morphology of the primate transitional vertebra in museum collections and experimentally modified mice.  Quantitative and qualitative analyses will be conducted on primate museum specimens and Hox9 modified mouse thoracic and lumbar columns using 3D and micro-CT scanning and a large osteological dataset. These analyzes will address two important questions: 1) whether patterns of the thoracolumbar transition are similar across apes, and 2) the developmental independence of various thoracic and lumbar vertebral features. Both are necessary for resolving debate regarding the evolution of the spine in hominoids.",NSF,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,11820,1650879,philipre@pcom.edu,Philip,Reno,1,"The major goals of this project were to investigate patterns of morphology change in vertebrae and the shape major vertebral characters (e.g. articular facet, spinous process, rib, and transverse process) throughout primate evolution. Another major goal of this project was to investigate the developmental relationship of these vertebral characters using Hox modified mouse models in order to assess developmental linkage or independence of traits in comparison to the primate evolutionary record.

The first aim of this study was to identify the morphological patterns in shape changes of the individual vertebral components (transverse, spinous, and articular processes) relative to the presence/absence of ribs and placement of the transitional vertebra across the thoracolumbar transition in mice with Hox9 mutations. To address this aim, we analyzed Hox9 modified mice to investigate developmental association or independence of vertebral characters including articular facets, spinous processes, transverse processes, and costal processes. The results of this study indicated that the different Hox clusters have distinct roles on different morphology and in different areas of the vertebral column. Hoxa9, -b9, -c9 and -d9 paralogs had specific and largely separate roles in specifying vertebral identity. Hoxa9 mutations in mice impacted rib placement and count. Hoxb9 and Hoxc9 modifications in isolation affected the placement of the transitional vertebra and the position of spinous process orientation change. The results of this study indicate that articular facet orientation can be altered independent of costal identity and that articular facet orientation and spinous process orientation shift together whereas transverse process orientation shifts once with the transitional vertebra and a second time over the rib boundary.

The second aim of this study was to analyze the patterns of shape change in the individual vertebral components (transverse, spinous, and articular processes) relative to the presence/absence of ribs and placement of the transitional vertebra across the thoracolumbar transition in anthropoid primates and analyze the patterns of shape change and sacrum placement at the lumbosacral transition in anthropoid primates and to compare the diversity in vertebral patterns of Hox9 mutant mice with those observed in primates. To address this aim, we analyzed a 3D dataset of primate vertebrae to look at characters associated with vertebral column mobility and stiffening. We scanned primate vertebral columns from the 8th thoracic to the 3rd lumbar using either a NextEngine 3D surface scanner or an Artec Space Spider Surface Scanner. Using the scans, the vertebrae were scored for ""thoracic"" and ""lumbar"" characteristics and the angles of spinous processes were measured to assess spinous process shape in order to determine what vertebral characters may be linked over the articular facet and costal transitions. These data were compared to the Hox mouse models to assess the developmental independence of transitional and costal characters in primates. The results of this study showed that like the Hox mice, articular facet orientation and spinous process orientation were correlated and that there was a shift in transverse process orientation both at the articular facet transition and the costal transition, when they were not in unison. This demonstrates that classic Schultz definitions may not correspond to the developmental boundaries that determine vertebral morphology.

Finally, the third aim was to compare prezygapophyseal articular facet (PAF) shape within and between different hominoid species to identify changes related to differences in vertebral function across thoracolumbar transition. To address this aim, we analyzed the 3D primate dataset using geometric morphometrics to assess differences between pre- and post-transitional vertebrae within the context of hominoid evolution. The dataset is divided into analyses of the entire section of the vertebral column sampled (T8&ndash;L2), individual analyses of the transitional vertebra and first two post-transitional vertebrae, individual species analyses of the vertebral column, and finally individual species analyses of individual articular facet surfaces independent of orientation. Overall, differences were seen in shape and orientation across the transitional vertebra between species and this often correlated with locomotor pattern and where mobility or stiffening was needed in the spine.

Overall, these projects address two important questions: 1) whether patterns of the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral transitions are similar across apes, and 2) the developmental independence of various thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebral features.

These projects had broader impacts including the production of a female PhD and the training of multiple female undergraduates in 3D data collection and image processing and analysis. This training helped one female undergraduate learn the skills needed to attain her Master?s thesis. In addition to this, the data from these projects will soon be disseminated to the scientific community in publications. Furthermore, these data and ideas explored in this research will be used by the PI in ongoing outreach collaborations with the M&uuml;tter Museum at the College of Physicians of Philadelphia to enrich STEM education efforts to otherwise underserved Philadelphia high school students.

"Research in human biology has provided evidence that early life factors shape later life outcomes through biological mechanisms. This dissertation research project will investigate linkages between physiological and nutritional aspects of early life and the risk of childhood and adult obesity, with a specific focus on diet, appetite and growth during the first year of life. The results will shed light on what kinds of diets during infancy might reduce obesity risk, and on social factors that help families make more optimal dietary choices. The project addresses fundamental questions in life history theory, and will be relevant to the well-being of the US population, for which obesity rates continue to increase. Data will be shared with clinical practitioners who advise families from all types of social backgrounds about nutrition for their children, and policy makers who focus on improving access to adequate nutrition for young children and their families. The project will also support student training in STEM research at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

This project integrates social determinants of health and developmental origins of health and disease frameworks to investigate how social contexts influence access to nutrition and information about nutrition, and how the nutrition infants experience shapes long-term health. It also uses the concept of the developmental niche to explore how caregiver observations of infant growth and family mealtime interactions influence what and how infants eat. The investigator will follow Latino families with young infants from 3 to 12 months of age. Ethnographic interviews will be conducted to understand what kinds of factors influence how and what parents feed their infants. Survey and observational data will be collected to understand how infant appetite and mealtime interactions influence what and how much infants eat. Growth hormones and infant growth measurements will be collected to understand how infants' diets influence their growth and growth hormones. Appetite hormone analysis will be completed to understand how appetite hormones influence and are influenced by infant nutrition. The findings will illuminate how social contexts, family behaviors and infant biology are intertwined in ways that may influence obesity risk.",NSF,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,NC,30157,1650751,althomps@email.unc.edu,Amanda,Thompson,1,"There is mounting evidence that factors that influence early development&mdash;such as prenatal health and nutrition during infancy&mdash;influences later health outcomes, such as risk of childhood and adult obesity and metabolic disease. This project investigated how families in Central North Carolina decided how and what to feed their growing infants, and how infant feeding impacted growth outcomes and leptin, a hormone that influences appetite, in ways that may increase or reduce obesity risk. The specific goals were to: 1) understand how mothers made decisions about infant feeding; 2) explore how infant?s appetites influenced infant feeding and growth; and 3) assess if and how the hormone leptin influenced infants? appetites and growth.

This project integrated critical medical anthropology and the developmental origins of health and disease frameworks to investigate how social contexts influenced mothers? access to information and support related to infant feeding. It also used the concept of the developmental niche to explore how caregiver observations of infant appetites influenced what and how infants ate. This study followed 63 families living in Central North Carolina, all of whom had infants under 12 months of age at the time of enrollment. Families participated in three interviews over the course of approximately six months. Survey data that measured infant appetites and diets, growth measurements, and samples that measured the hormone leptin were collected at each time point.

The results from this study shed light on the kinds of social factors that help families make more optimal infant feeding choices, and how infant feeding and infant appetites might develop in ways that influence later obesity risk. Ethnographic interviews probed into what influenced mothers? infant feeding decisions. Mothers described the complex relationships they had with breastfeeding and giving their infants formula. Most mothers received support from partners, family and friends, and health care professionals such as lactation consultants, but the type of support they received varied widely and affected how they felt about infant feeding. Many mothers also described how feedback they received from their infants&mdash;in the form of infants? dispositions and growth&mdash;was important for deciding whether to continue breastfeeding exclusively or to introduce formula. The findings from this aim highlight the need to ensure mothers have access to support from providers who show compassion and listen sensitively to mothers? goals and concerns for feeding their infants. Providing the right support at the right time can help improve breastfeeding outcomes, such as how long mothers breastfeed their infants.

Breastfeeding is important, because the additional results demonstrate that breastfeeding, more so than infant appetite, was associated with growth outcomes. Infants who received more breastmilk generally had lower age-adjusted weight, length, and BMI. Infant feeding was also associated with body composition: infants who received formula had smaller subscapular skinfold thickness and larger quadriceps skinfold thickness. There were few associations between infant appetites and growth: food responsiveness was associated with lower arm circumference, and satiety responsiveness was associated with larger abdominal skinfold thickness. However, both breastfeeding and leptin were associated with infant appetite behaviors, which may influence growth outcomes in later childhood. This study found that infants who received more breastmilk had higher enjoyment of food and lower food fussiness scores. Furthermore, leptin was associated with lower enjoyment of food, lower food fussiness and slower eating scores. Leptin levels also predicted growth, specifically higher weight-for-length (larger body size), larger arm and abdominal circumference, and larger abdominal skinfold thickness. Taken together, these findings suggest that infant milk feeding and leptin are both important for programming infant growth and appetite behaviors that may influence later eating habits and body size.

The findings from this study have demonstrated that family?s social contexts are important for helping mothers decide how to feed their infants, and that infant milk feeding and biology&mdash;specifically infants? appetite behaviors, leptin levels, and growth outcomes&mdash;are intertwined in ways that may influence later growth and health as children and adults.

"Skeletal collections from past human populations provide a unique resource for understanding relationships between human culture and biology, including the study of disease dynamics across space and time. This doctoral dissertation project is a bioarchaeological study of skeletons from the 19th century to investigate the impact of early childhood nutrition and stress on infectious disease mortality in later life. This research contributes to our understanding of paleopathology, human biology and adaptation, and the developmental origins of disease, and has the potential to shift public health attention to early life conditions as a major factor contributing to infectious disease persistence. The project also will support undergraduate and graduate student training in STEM laboratory and field research. 

This is a study to understand the role early childhood stress and diet play in mortality from infectious disease. The investigator will assess skeletal pathology, stunting, dental histology, and diet in a skeletal sample of 19th-century cholera victims and contemporaneous cholera survivors, and investigate whether early life conditions increased or decreased survivability later in life, in the context of the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis.  The study will test predictive-adaptive response and plasticity/constraint hypotheses that attempt to explain how stress in early life influences later-life well-being and mortality.",NSF,University of Georgia Research Foundation Inc,GA,23307,1650930,reitsema@uga.edu,Laurie,Reitsema,1,"Poor health in early childhood is associated with earlier adult age-at-death as a result of chronic metabolic disorders, such as heart disease and type II diabetes. This association between early childhood physiological stress and chronic metabolic disorder in adulthood has been thoroughly studied, but little research has focused on the effects of early childhood stress on death from infectious disease in adulthood. This project investigates this relationship by analyzing skeletal markers of early childhood stress from 19th century Italian populations. Historic populations are idea for investigating disease susceptibility because they predate- the influence of antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, which first began in the early 20th century. We compare two populations from catastrophic cemeteries that died from pandemic waves of cholera in Italy during the 19th century to two contemporaneous populations from general-use cemeteries. Skeletal remains capture health information throughout an individual?s lifetime, allowing for the reconstruction of stress events during childhood and throughout adulthood. This project specifically analyzes pathological skeletal markers (cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, etc.), adult terminal height, dental pathologies, and age-at-weaning between the cholera victims and general populations. Our paleopathology analysis has found that cholera victims, compared to the general populations, are significantly less likely to exhibit cribra orbitalia, a porotic pathological marker found on the eye orbits that indicates anemia brought on by general malnutrition or infection during early childhood. Additionally, stature of cholera victims is significantly lower compared to the general population. These results are conflicting; Anemia in early childhood appears to reduce the risk of death from infectious disease whereas chronic physiological stress in early childhood, leading short stature in adulthood, appears to increase susceptibility to infectious disease. These conflicting results demonstrate the need to determine the impact of timing on stress events, which will be explored through analyzing time-specific stress markers. The results of this research are expected to be complete by July 2019 and will be submitted for publication during late 2019 and early 2020.

Broader Impacts:  Currently, cholera is a re-emerging infectious disease, despite the development of antibiotic treatments and availability of oral rehydration therapies. The cholera bacterium is endemic in most of the world?s water supplies and the recent increase in flooding events and natural disasters due to climate change will likely increase the incidence of cholera in the coming years. Analysis of the influence of lifetime stress and nutrition on cholera manifestation and mortality contributes to the field of public health, and the results of this research could be influential in creating effective intervention strategies to prevent the spread of infectious disease. This research has the transformative potential to shifting public health attention to early life conditions as a main factor in infectious disease persistence and will affirm the need for supplemental nutrition programs to combat the spread of infectious disease. Additionally, this research has funded the doctoral training of an anthropology graduate student and the thesis research for a senior undergraduate student. The results of the preliminary research for this project has been presented at academic and undergraduate research conferences and informal presentations to collaborators in Italy. The complete results of this project will be disseminated to academic and public health professionals in a minimum of 4 manuscripts.

Intellectual Merit: This research project contributes to our understanding of human biology and adaptation by furthering our understanding of the impact of poor nutritional environments on later adult health. This research differs from previous research by focusing specifically on infectious disease instead of chronic metabolic diseases. Skeletal populations are particularly useful for the study of the developmental origins of disease because many collections from various regions and times can be analyzed, providing a greater time depth and regional diversity than studies of living human populations. This research analyzes mortality outcomes without the need for longitudinal studies.

"This dissertation project will study the role of parasites on the evolution of the human gut microbiome (the community of micro-organisms that live in the human digestive tract), their importance in these micro-environments, and the consequences of their loss in modern industrialized populations. Recent research has shown that the gut microbiome of industrialized populations has reduced species diversity, including the loss of microbial species that can help to reduce inflammation in the body. The reduction of parasite infections in these populations may be related reduced gut microbiome diversity and the increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases in the industrialized world. This project will advance our understanding of human biology and the co-evolution of species, while supporting student training and inclusion of underserved groups in scientific research. A series of scientific computing workshops will be offered through the Center on American Indian and Alaska Native Genomic Research and made available to the general public to encourage continued scientific education. Given that parasite infection remains a major source of morbidity and mortality world-wide, procedures developed in this project for the detection and analysis of parasites will be disseminated through international partnerships in regions where these types of infections pose a major public health concern.
 
This project investigates whether the loss of parasites in the industrialized gut can explain the loss of microbial diversity in these micro-ecosystems. Using fecal samples from five geographically and culturally variable populations including industrialized peoples in the United States, and traditional peoples in South America and Africa, this study proposes to (1) describe the impact of parasites on the human gut microbiome, and (2) document the influence of lifestyle including subsistence strategy on parasite diversity in traditional and industrialized societies. Parasite DNA sequenced from samples collected for this study will be compared to bacterial community data using a variety of statistical procedures to detect whole community as well as functional shifts that may be linked to parasite infection.",NSF,University of Oklahoma Norman Campus,OK,25184,1650746,cmlewis@ou.edu,Cecil,Lewis,1,"Given the importance of the gut microbiome in understanding human health and disease and the coevolution of microbes in host-associated microbial ecosystems, studies of the gut microbiota is increasingly integrated into biological anthropology. While metagenomics (the sequencing of whole genomes) and metabarcoding (profiling of a community of organisms using a targeted amplicon approach) have clarified the role of microbes in these complex ecosystems, a focus on bacterial communities in industrialized human populations limits interpretation of the natural diversity and evolution of the human gut microbiome. The main goal of this project is to document under characterized members of the human gut microbiome using a comparative approach in five human populations representing rural agriculturalists, hunter-gatherers, and industrialized populations. To this end, two novel protocols were designed. The first used a combination of traditional PCR amplification and shotgun metagenomic Illumina library preparation to compare the taxonomic resolution of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region of the eukaryotic ribosomal DNA complex. Results of this experiment led to the design of duel barcoded Illumina sequencing adapters for the ITS1 region, allowing for the quick amplification and pooling of multiple samples. We find that gut-associated eukaryotes are diverse in non-industrialized populations while almost completely absent in industrialized individuals. Moreover, a substantial number of eukaryotic taxa are shared between non-industrialized human populations independent of geography or subsistence pattern, recapitulating patterns of bacterial diversity among human populations.


In the second project, a serial filtering protocol was designed to separate organisms in fecal samples by cell size. The initial design of this protocol was to enrich for eukaryotic organisms but was inefficient at removing bacterial organisms even at high filtration levels. To determine the composition of bacterial organisms at each filtration level, Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared for six individuals. We find that there are no substantial patterns of bacterial taxa found at higher filtration levels but there is a significant enrichment for organisms belonging to the phylum Cyanobacteria at the lowest filter and flow through. This pattern is especially pronounced in non-industrialized individuals. The enriched bacteria belong to the class Melainabacteria which are a understudied group of non-photosynthetic Cyanobacteria currently described only by their presence in metagenomic datasets. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of serial filtration as a cost-effective method to screen candidate samples for further investigations of low frequency bacteria including full genome reconstruction and culture isolation of novel strains.

"This dissertation project is an investigation of genetic relationships among populations of Neotropical monkey species, to better understand how populations change over time and become different species. Specifically, the project will address species boundaries, patterns and consequences of hybridization, and how human impact on the environment affects species' persistence and movement through the landscape. This research will result in science-based tools for conservation managers, including the development of genetic tools to improve species management practices, the identification of potential locations for habitat corridors, and recommendations on how to maintain population viability in human-impacted environments. The project will provide numerous opportunities for student training, public science outreach and international research collaborations.

The blond capuchin monkey occurs in the Atlantic rainforest of northeastern Brazil, and given the extent of historic loss and fragmentation of this habitat, extant populations exist in relative isolation. The extent to which this fragmented landscape impacts the blond capuchin's genetic diversity is not known. Using a genomic approach, this study will (1) describe the evolutionary relationships among species in the robust capuchin lineage, (2) examine the presence of hybrid zones between capuchins of the northern Atlantic Forest and Caatinga habitats, and (3) contribute to our understanding of how human-modified habitats have affected primate genetic variation and population connectivity. This project addresses fundamental questions about speciation and population genetics and contributes to conservation efforts that require substantial knowledge of species' natural and evolutionary history.",NSF,University of Texas at Austin,TX,21685,1650844,anthony.difiore@austin.utexas.edu,Anthony,Di Fiore,1,"We used a genomic approach to investigate the evolutionary relationships, patterns of hybridization between the blond capuchin monkey and its congeners, and to examine the spatial genetic variation within and among populations of blond capuchins. The blond capuchin monkey is a Neotropical primate endemic to Atlantic Forest of Brazil, which is a highly fragmented and impacted environment, considered one of the hotspots of species diversity and endemicity. This ecosystem occupies less than 12% of its original extent and provides an ideal habitat to study the impact of fragmentation and anthropogenic factors on primate persistence and gene flow through the landscape. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Instituto Chico Mendes de Conserva&ccedil;&atilde;o da Biodiversidade (Chico Mendes Institute for Conservation of the Biodiversity, ICMBio/Brazil) have recently classified the blond capuchin monkey as Endangered (EN) due its small current geographic range and the steep reduction in population size it has experienced in the recent past. Because of its Atlantic Forest distribution, doubts on its evolutionary relationships with other capuchins, and the possible importance of ongoing natural and human-facilitated hybridization it is very important to conduct a broad genetic study that generates information to improve conservation actions for the species.

Our project aimed to use a genomic approach 1) to describe the evolutionary relationships and history of the capuchin monkeys of the northern Atlantic Forest and Caatinga biomes of Brazil; 2) to identify the presence of hybrids between the blond capuchin monkey and two of its congeners; and 3) to characterize the population structure of blond capuchin monkey populations living in an anthropogenically impacted landscape.

Towards this end, we obtained DNA samples from 250 individuals from the 8 known capuchin monkey species and discovered genetic markers throughout the genomes of individuals from nine populations of blond capuchin monkey, four populations of wild bearded capuchins, and two populations of wild yellow-breasted capuchins from deep within the geographic ranges of each of these species, as well as from 6 populations of capuchins in potential hybrid zones and of Amazonian capuchin monkeys. To date, we have standardized the use of a novel method for identifying and rapidly genotyping thousands of molecular markers throughout the genome of capuchins and have started to conduct the final bioinformatic analysis to address our research questions.

Our project has provided mentoring opportunities for nine undergraduate students from both Federal and State Universities in Paraiba, Brazil. All these undergraduate students received a broad training in ecological data collection, DNA extraction, and GIS software and analysis. Three of these students developed their final undergraduate thesis using data from the field expeditions. In addition, two students are being trained in statistical analysis and processing of genomic data using bioinformatics as we conduct the final analytical steps of this project.

Finally, one of the most important impacts of this project will be the generation of science-based recommendations for conservation managers on identifying potential areas for habitat corridors and on increasing our knowledge of the impacts and outcomes that decreasing connectivity and population fragmentation have on evolutionary and short-term genetic variation in primates. Therefore, our project contributes to the improvement of conservation actions outlined in the Conservation Action Plan (PAN-PRINE) for the threatened primates of northeastern Brazil, which was developed with the involvement of researchers, conservationists, agroindustry representatives, and local communities. One of the proposed actions is the development and maintenance of a habitat corridor in the Paraiba state of Brazil, and we are working with the PAN-PRINE committee to incorporate this project?s results and recommendations into the ongoing conservation plan.

An additional priority of this project was to support local community involvement in the conservation of the blond capuchin monkey. The involvement of local community has been reinforced through the delivery of conservation workshops in local schools, the distribution of banners and handouts with pictures of the threatened monkeys, and dissemination of information about their conservation to local jurisdictions. Additionally, members of local communities living near surveyed forest fragments were hired as field guides and trained to become field assistants, improving their knowledge and involvement in the conservation activities. Furthermore, we have presented the data on the standardization of the methods and results from field expeditions at national and international scientific meetings and have participated at local workshops to help improving conservation actions for the species.

"Humans differ from other living primates in terms of diet, metabolic traits, and disease susceptibilities, yet little is known about how these differences arose or the genetic mechanisms underlying these differences. This doctoral dissertation project will use a comparative primate model to investigate how gene expression in fat cells has changed during human evolution and the role of diet in these gene expression differences. The research will contribute to our growing understanding of important relationships among human evolutionary origins, uniquely human traits, and health and disease risks in modern humans, and will be relevant to evolutionary anthropology and clinical research on nutrition and metabolism. The project will support graduate and undergraduate student training and mentoring in STEM research, as well as public science outreach activities and dissemination of novel data and techniques.

Metabolic traits and diet were of particular importance during human evolution and play a role in many common human diseases and chronic conditions today. This project utilizes several state-of-the-art techniques to address evolutionary questions about the evolution of diet and metabolism in humans. The investigators will use induced pluripotent stem cells from humans and other primate species to investigate regulatory regions controlling gene expression in adipocytes. A massively parallel reporter assay will be used to determine the activity of these regulatory regions. Changes in gene expression in response to different dietary components such as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids will also be measured.",NSF,Duke University,NC,31765,1650954,gwray@duke.edu,Gregory,Wray,1,"Understanding the underpinnings of uniquely human traits is critical to understanding our own evolutionary origins as well as our current disease risks. Metabolic traits and diet were of particular importance during human evolution and play a role in many common human diseases today. Humans differ from other modern primates in diet, metabolic traits, and disease susceptibilities, yet little is known about how these differences arose and are controlled. This doctoral dissertation project has investigated how gene expression in fat cells has changed during human evolution and the role of diet in these gene expression differences. The researchers have used human and chimpanzee fat cells, which have important metabolic functions, to measure the activity of genes and metabolites as well as their response to different dietary components. This has allowed them to identify how gene regulation and diet has contributed to  human-specific metabolic traits that may have had profound impacts on our evolutionary history as well as our susceptibility to disease. The project has supported graduate student training, undergraduate student training, public outreach and dissemination of novel data and techniques. 

This project has utilized several state-of-the-art techniques to begin to address evolutionary questions with important societal implications. The investigators used induced pluripotent stem cells from humans and chimpanzees which has given access to samples and experimental manipulations that were previously unavailable. They measured gene expression and metabolite levels in human and chimpanzee fat cells in response to various dietary conditions and have identified species-specific differences. Together, this has allowed for a richer understanding of the interplay between and relative importance of genetic and dietary changes during human origins. This project has additionally supported graduate training, undergraduate training, and public outreach.

"There is substantial evidence that social factors can affect physiological well-being and evolutionary fitness, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these relationships are not well understood. This dissertation project examines patterns of change in gene expression as they are distributed through the social networks of free-ranging rhesus monkeys, to understand how chronic social isolation might translate into physiological effects. The project will result in comparative data on sociality and epigenetic change that can inform research on human well-being and social isolation. Findings from the project will be made accessible to the global scientific community, and the project will support undergraduate and graduate student training in STEM research, as well as public science outreach activities. 

Although we know much about the health and fitness benefits of investing in social bonds, we know little about the molecular mechanisms that actually translate these effects. This project will test the hypothesis that DNA methylation is a coordinated response to the social environment, by comparing methylation patterns for those in chronic social isolation and those heavily involved in a group's social life, and assessing methylation patterns in genetic pathways of known consequence for physiological well-being. The investigators will use a multi-year, multi-group behavioral data set to quantify the social networks of 80 monkeys (M. mulatta) of the Cayo Santiago colony using the tool-kit of Social Network Analysis (SNA). Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing with whole blood DNA will be used to calculate genome-wide methylation levels and  The investigators will also determine if there is over-representation of DNA methylation in a behaviorally- and health-implicated serotonergic system. Past and pilot research indicates that serotonergic genetics might be differentially adaptive based on variance in the social environment, and this study will provide empirical data to better understand the role of the serotonergic system signaling pathway in phenotypic plasticity.",NSF,University of Pennsylvania,PA,24042,1650850,mplatt@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,Michael,Platt,1,"Sam Larson completed dissertation research on genetic and epigenetic contributions of the serotonergic system on measures of stress, health, and social engagement in a free-ranging population of rhesus macaques (M. mulatta). Through the tool-kit of social network analysis, we were able to characterize social positioning for more the 650 animals across 6 social groups. We were able to genotype ca. 890 animals for two genes of the system (SERT and TPH2). We collected several measures of stress and health, including conspicuous behavioral signals of stress, body composition, mortality and fertility.

In terms of genetic sequence variation, we found some evidence to suggest that certain polymorphisms impacted stress, and that these effects showed sex-specific patterning. For example, we found a significant main effect for SERT on the incidence of self-directed behaviors, a well-versed indicator of stress (Figure 1). What's more, both SERT and TPH2 interacted with sex so that females in possession of the minor alleles either showed attenuated (SERT) or reversed (TPH2) effects. Further endorsing these results, estimated life-expectancies showed that females in possession of the so-thought deleterious SERT allele lived longer than females that did not, while the opposite pattern was observed in males (Figure 2).

We also examined epigenetic variation (methylation) with the serotonin transporter. We developed and tested 3 sets of primers which successfully interrogated 600+ bp of a promoter region of the serotonin transporter. Unfortunately, out attempts at examining methylation with these primers were marred by several issues. First, we were challenged to control contamination within the lab. Our attempts at ameliorating this issue involved: (1) performing all wet-work in a cleanroom, and (2) at one time replacing all materials. While the latter worked for a time, cross-contamination eventually reappeared. Second, we were challenged by the persistence of secondary products from the PCR amplification. To assuage this issue, we tried manipulation of all aspects of the amplification procedure, including the amount of DNA, amount of primer, annealing temperature, and number of cycles, to no avail. Despite these products, we conducted multiple attempts at pyrosequencing, but doing so did not reveal interpretable results of the region.

This necessitated our switching techniques. We employed COBRA assays, which use an enzyme digest that cuts DNA at various CpG sites depending on whether they show methylation. Since this was a less traversed approach with this region, we tested 7 different digests (TaqI, FauI, Hhal, BsiEI, BsaXI, Hphl, and HpyCH4IV). We had minimal successes with BsaXI, which was able to interrogate three CpG sites in conjunction with one of our primer sets: it revealed no usable variation between individuals in methylation marks in this region.

The body of research on the contributions of serotonergic genetics to health, especially in conjunction with early-life stress, has been characterized by publication bias and false positives. This endorses a caution in interpreting the results of this and any study. Here we found evidence, mirroring that in humans, that so-thought ""deleterious"" serotonergic alleles impact individuals in a sex specific way. While certainly more research is needed to explore this idea, it is the hope of PI-Larson that the impact of sequence variation visible here endorses the utility of contextualizing familiar humans results in the evolutionary context of free-ranging nonhuman primates.

"Menarche (first menses) is a critical reproductive life history marker with potential links to early-life environment and later-life health risks. This dissertation research project investigates menarche in a life history framework, to better understand the relationship among DNA modifications, early life psychosocial and energetic stressors, and age at menarche, as well as the effect of these variables on adult reproductive hormone levels. The project will contribute to a growing body of knowledge on the ways that childhood environmental variables directly and indirectly affect human reproductive life history trajectories, and may inform public health research related to the timing of menarche. Results of this study will be shared with the wider scientific community, and the project will support training of a female graduate student and inclusive science outreach efforts. 

Epigenetic traits like DNA methylation are thought to be modified by an individual?s early environment. This project examines DNA methylation as one way that different environments can produce variation in reproductive traits, namely age at menarche and adult reproductive hormone concentrations. The research is conducted in two genetically similar populations living in different early-life environments, in order to parse the different effects of genes and developmental environments on these reproductive traits. The investigators will explore the contexts in which energetic versus psychosocial stressors are more likely to affect age at menarche, building on current conceptual models that describe the effects of childhood environments on adult reproductive traits. The investigators will test for combined effects of DNA methylation and early stressors on menarcheal age, and for effects of all three variables on adult hormone concentrations.",NSF,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,IL,31712,1650839,kclancy@illinois.edu,Kathryn,Clancy,1,"Timing of first menstruation (known as menarche) is variable. In addition to representing an important life history transition, this age is associated with future reproductive traits like adult reproductive hormone concentrations. The overarching objective of this research was to investigate causes of variation in age at menarche and adult reproductive hormone concentrations across the menstrual cycle. This project was conducted with Polish and Polish American women to characterize and understand variation in age at menarche and menstrual hormone concentrations in related populations living in different environments.

Primary project aims included exploring the link between childhood stressors, age at menarche, and adult reproductive hormones, as well as investigating physiological mechanisms by which childhood stress may impact adult reproductive traits. We first looked at the connection between types of childhood energetic stressors (e.g. farming, physical activity) and psychosocial stressors (e.g. adverse childhood experiences) with variation in age at menarche and adult hormones. The hormones measured included estrone-3-glucuronide (E1G, a metabolite of the hormone estradiol) and pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG, metabolite of the hormone progesterone), and these hormones were quantified across full menstrual cycles. We then further investigated the epigenetic trait gene methylation as a link between stress and hormonal variation. Gene methylation can be responsive to the lived environment (including stress) and can modify gene expression. The modifiable nature of gene methylation makes it an informative method through which to study how childhood stress may affect reproductive biology.

This study further included analyzing trends over time in ages at menarche in rural Poland and identifying natural variation in reproductive hormone concentrations. Our work is published in the American Journal of Human Biology and as a chapter in The Routledge Handbook of Anthropology and Reproduction. In the publications, we delve into ways local socioeconomic changes affect major life history traits like timing of menarche. We further write about the multiple, non-mutually exclusive, evolutionary-based hypotheses of variation in reproductive function. We explore the large range in normal variation in daily menstrual hormone concentrations, and we highlight the importance of context in interpreting relationships between early ages at menarche and future outcomes.

Contributions to science and society included disseminating research results through peer-reviewed publications, presentations at local and national conferences, and a dissertation thesis. Through this project, multiple undergraduate and graduate students were trained in research methods in anthropology, epigenetics, and reproductive ecology. Co-PI Rogers further shared skills developed through this project as a co-organizer and co-leader of the 2019 workshop ""Integrating Epigenetic Data with Anthropological Research"" at the American Association of Physical Anthropologists Conference. The workshop materials were made publically available for others wanting to learn about anthropological epigenetic research methods.

"Mammalian mothers have evolved to produce milk for their infants while maintaining a healthy body condition, but little is known about how wild primate mothers modify their diet and behavior to ensure both infant and mother survival.  This dissertation project examines how wild orangutan mothers meet their energetic needs while nursing an infant during extended periods of low fruit and overall caloric availability. The research will provide a comparative model for human ancestors that may also have survived and reproduced through periods of resource uncertainty. In addition, Bornean orangutans are critically endangered, and research findings from this project will support primate conservation efforts. This project will also provide training in data management, behavioral data collection, and lab-based behavioral endocrinology for students from underrepresented groups in the STEM fields.

Research focusing on primate reproduction and life-history has revealed that primates have longer gestation and lactation periods, and extended periods of juvenile dependency relative to other mammalian species of similar size. Thus, it is likely that primate mothers, particularly those who nurse for multiple years spanning periods of unpredictable and low food availability, will have evolved a suite of behavioral and physiological adaptions to cope with the long-term energetic demands of motherhood while minimizing risk to her developing infant. This project examines the behavioral and physiological strategies that wild Bornean mother orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii) use to maintain homeostasis across periods of infant development. The project utilizes several non-invasive methodologies: behavioral observations of orangutans, macronutrient analysis of food items, and physiological urinary analyses. This will be one of the first studies of a wild primate species to test if mothers modulate their nutritional intake and subsequent energetic status throughout lactation and infant development, and if/how they maintain homeostasis during this energetically costly period.",NSF,Rutgers University New Brunswick,NJ,25200,1650814,erin.vogel@rutgers.edu,Erin,Vogel,1,"Compared to other animals, primates (including humans) have some of the longest periods of development, including gestation length, length of lactation period, and period of juvenile dependency. These periods are shaped through an interplay between external ecological factors and internal body costs, making energy and nutrient availability one of the most important resources in the environment. Orangutans a great ape closely related to humans, have the longest lactation period of any mammal (on average around 7 years), and live in relatively poor quality habitats. The goal of this study was to examine the behavioral strategies mother orangutans use to acquire energy and the consequential physiological outcomes across periods of infant development. To do this, we conducted a cross-sectional study on wild Bornean orangutans at Tuanan Research Station in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. There were three objectives for this research project: to determine 1) whether a mother modifies her dietary composition and nutritional balance throughout infant development, 2) how the energetic condition of a mother varies across infant development, and 3) how a mother who lactates across multiple years maintains her condition in a relatively marginal and variable energetic environment. To completely fulfill these three objectives, the project utilized several methodologies: behavioral observations of orangutans, macronutrient analysis of food items, and physiological urinary analyses.

We found that mother orangutans do indeed modify their diet and nutritional intake in response to both infant age and the availability of fruit in the habitat, and that her worst energetic condition is while she has a young infant in a period of low fruit availability. Overall, mother orangutans utilize two different strategies to maintain her condition in a relatively marginal and variable energetic environment: during high fruit periods they seek out carbohydrate-rich foods like fruit, modifying their behavior to maximize their intake, while during low fruit periods mothers eat more readily available food and minimize the time they are active to reduce energetic expenditure. This is especially true for mothers with young infants. This project has many contributions to intellectual merit. Perhaps the most important, orangutans serve as an excellent ape model to help understand how our early ancestors survived and reproduced through periods of resource uncertainty, as preliminary data suggest orangutans show similar energetic patterns to modern humans throughout gestation and lactation. The broader impacts of this project include work towards both science education and conservation. Bornean orangutans are now critically endangered and face a multitude of threats including habitat destruction and deforestation from large-scale farming, logging operations, and unprecedented levels of wildfires. This project provided training to both American and Indonesian undergraduate and graduate students within this larger conservation context.

"This dissertation project will investigate how energy is allocated to competing biological needs in humans. Tradeoffs between male reproductive effort and immune function underlie several theories about the evolution of human biology. The investigator will explore these theories by testing how individual physiology (including testosterone in men) is associated with immune responses to infection by parasites, and how lifestyle variation influences this relationship, in a population with a high parasitic disease burden. Infection patterns identified in this study may help to inform treatment protocols by measuring how individual physiology (hormone levels) and lifestyle (diet and housing factors) affect parasite exposure and infectious disease risk. Furthermore, these analyses will improve the health of individuals at the study location through education and treatment of infections. The project will support undergraduate and graduate training and mentorship in STEM research. 

This project evaluates predicted life history compromises between male reproductive effort and immune function among the Shuar. Life history theory (LHT) seeks to explain the timing and context-sensitive allocation of energetic resources to critical physical and reproductive functions. A critical premise of LHT is that resources used for one function cannot be used for another; thus, tradeoffs are predicted among different aspects of physical and reproductive investment. These tradeoffs are physiologically regulated, including via hormone levels. For example, the hormone testosterone (T) is thought to mediate tradeoffs between reproductive effort and immunity. Work with non-human animals has shown T to generally increase investment in physical traits associated with male reproduction (e.g., musculature) while suppressing immune function. However, this tradeoff is not well-tested in humans. The Shuar experience a relatively high pathogen environment, with subsequent increases in immune activation costs. Further, pathogen exposure varies across their territory, and in relation to their access to economic resources. This setting provides an excellent opportunity for testing the hypothesized relations among T profile, immunity, and reproductive investment. To test these associations several measures will be collected, including the presence of observable parasite species and eggs per gram in fresh fecal samples; T levels from saliva samples; physical measures thought to be associated with developmental T levels (height, grip strength, chest compression, upper arm circumference, and 2D:4D digit ratio); immune markers from dried blood spots; and household economic, dietary, and style of life questionnaire data. In addition, this study will assess if T profiles vary between traditionally-living and urbanized Shuar in relation to differences in pathogen exposure. This work will therefore contribute to our understanding of human life history, male reproduction, and health through documenting tradeoffs between reproduction and immune responses, two energetically expensive functions.",NSF,University of Oregon Eugene,OR,11464,1650674,jjosh@uoregon.edu,James,Snodgrass,1,"The hormone testosterone plays a key role in energy allocation and the development of male characteristics such as increased muscle mass and strength. Furthermore, evidence suggests that testosterone has negative effects on the immune system (e.g., reduced white blood cell count and suppressed antibody production), but enhances male reproduction. Testosterone is therefore hypothesized to influence energetic trade-offs between male reproduction and immunity. However, associations between testosterone and immune function in humans are not well established. This study tests these relationships among the Shuar - an indigenous population living in Amazonian Ecuador - to examine testosterone level variation, and investigate associations between testosterone levels, reproduction, and various measures of male health (i.e., parasitic disease burden and three markers of immune function).

Microscope slides were prepared from fecal samples to measure parasite load (i.e., to determine whether an individual was infected and, if so, measure how many parasites they had). Additionally, saliva samples were collected in the morning and evening for three days and analyzed in the University of Oregon Global Health Biomarker Lab to establish average morning and evening testosterone levels, and to track how testosterone levels changed throughout the day. Finally, minimally-invasive dried blood spot samples were collected and processed at the Global Health Biomarker Lab to measure immune activity indicated by (i) C-reactive protein (CRP; an acute marker of inflammation), (ii) Immunoglobulin G (IgG; a marker of acquired immunity against bacteria and viruses), and (iii) Immunoglobulin E (IgE; an indicator of parasite infection). Using these data, three studies were conducted to examine associations between testosterone levels and male reproductive health.

The first study tested testosterone level variation among Shuar men in relation to body composition, age, and style of life factors. This study demonstrated that age and body mass index (BMI) interactions shape testosterone levels in complex ways, such that the relationship between body composition and testosterone profile varies throughout the life course. The second study investigated whether individual reproductive success (i.e., number of living children) was significantly influenced by masculine trait development and parasite load. These results failed to support the hypotheses that masculine traits increased reproductive success or honestly signaled lack of parasitic disease. Instead, a significant positive association was observed between masculine traits and roundworm infection; suggesting that male investment in reproduction may increase parasitic infection risk.

The final study assessed whether testosterone levels were negatively associated with four measures of immune function (parasite load, CRP, IgG, and IgE). Testosterone levels were inversely associated with CRP levels and a positive relationship between testosterone levels and whipworm infection was documented, suggesting increased investment in reproductive effort may suppress some aspects of immune function and increase parasite burden. Overall, these studies suggest a trade-off exists between energetic investment in male reproduction and some aspects of immune function; thereby demonstrating multifaceted interactions between physical characteristics, hormones, and immune activity in human men.

Intellectual Merit: This study provides a unique examination of how hormonal variation influences disease risk in an indigenous population characterized by high rates of parasitic infection. The hypothesized relationships between the hormone testosterone and immune function in males remain poorly tested in human population. This study provides some of the first evidence that individual testosterone levels influence parasitic disease risk in humans. For example, analyses testing associations between testosterone levels and parasite load demonstrate a significant positive relationship, indicating that men with higher evening testosterone exhibit significantly higher parasite loads for some parasite species. These results suggest that men that invest a substantial amount of energetic resources in reproduction (as indicated by elevated testosterone levels) may do so at the expense of immune function. Furthermore, this pattern is similar to previous findings in non-human primates, including chimpanzees. Overall, these results support the idea of a trade-off existing between male investment in reproductive effort and immune function.

Broader Impacts: These findings have important public health implications. Infection patterns identified in this study help to inform future treatment programs, both in the United States and abroad, by highlighting how individuals of different sexes, hormone profiles, and communities are affected by parasitic infection. The development of effective drugs and vaccines is dependent on data generated from studies examining these immune responses. In addition, this study directly benefited Shuar participants. Study results have been written up and presented to the Shuar Federation to enhance understanding of Shuar health patterns, and to provide information useful in soliciting and planning health programs. Furthermore, after sample collection and analysis, results were used to facilitate the treatment of infected participants via collaborations with local health care providers.

"Skeletal anatomy across extinct and living colobine monkey species will be studied to understand relationships among physical form and function, behavior and environment, and to explore how extinct forms may have responded to forces like climate change, habitat loss, and competition with larger species. Project findings will serve as a resource for scientists interested in not only primate evolution, but also for understanding what locomotor behaviors can tell us about changing paleoenvironments. Some of the extinct species that will be included in this project are from sites that also contain early human fossils, providing an opportunity to examine environments in which early humans evolved. This study will provide undergraduate training opportunities in both data collection and project development, through the Primate Osteology and Primate Morphometrics Laboratories at the University of Oregon. Many of the extant colobine species are listed as either threatened or endangered, and this research will support primate conservation efforts.  

Studies of human evolution have focused on the effects of climatic and broad environmental change on species diversity. In this project, the investigator will focus on the effects of inter-specific interactions and competition during primate and human evolution. The aims of this project are to describe for the first time sets of associated colobine postcranial remains, to describe the functional morphology of these remains, and to assess the diversity of these and other fossil species in an ecological context, with an emphasis on the role of niche partitioning in colobine evolution. Both extant and fossil specimens will be described qualitatively and quantitatively. The quantitative portion will include skeletal measurements that are either standard for postcranial description or have been suggested to be functionally relevant in previous studies. The qualitative descriptions will be performed in more detail on the fossil specimens, particularly on those that have not yet been described. These data will be analyzed with respect to phylogenetic relationships, diet and body mass, and other ecologically relevant variables.",NSF,University of Oregon Eugene,OR,16456,1650923,sfrost@uoregon.edu,Stephen,Frost,1,"Doctoral Dissertation Research: Niche-Partitioning and Sympatry in the Fossil Colobines

The Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant allowed me to complete data collection for my PhD project by supporting travel to the following institutions: The National Museum of Kenya, the National Museum of Ethiopia, the Anthropological Institute and Museum of Zurich, the Mus&eacute;um national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris, the Natural History Museum of London, and the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. The international portion occurred from June 17 - October 8, 2017 with the final domestic museum visit occurring in December 2017. During each of these visits I collected data on fossil and living colobine monkey skeletal material including linear measurements, written descriptions, and photographs with the following goals:

1. Describing previously undescribed and/or unpublished fossils from East Africa.

2. Estimating the locomotor adaptations (terrestrial, arboreal) of these fossil species.

3. Using these data and estimates to compare the fossils with living species to examine the niche separation of monkeys during the Plio-Pleistocene.

For the past sixty years, studies in human evolution have focused on the effects of climatic and broad environmental change on species diversity, whereas my project takes a more ecological approach by focusing on the effects of competition within environments. Colobine monkeys are useful ecological referents and like many other mammal species, including pigs and bovids, can be used to reconstruct ancient environmental conditions. Many of the fossil species I focus on come from the same sites as early human fossils and can therefore help to provide a more complete picture of the condition under which our ancestors evolved. My methods employ caliper measurements of limb bones along with descriptions of the bones and muscle attachment sites to assess mobility vs. stability of the, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle joints. When compared to living monkeys of known behavioral patterns, I am able to estimate how the fossil forms were interacting with their environments. Included in my sample are several previously unpublished and relatively complete fossil colobine specimens that will help to more fully understand the species diversity at these site. Overall, I collected measurements and descriptions on 1,266 fossil and living monkey specimens; all of which are being included in the analyses for my dissertation project.

Many of the fossil species examined display skeletal morphology that suggests locomotor behaviors quite different from those in the living forms and collecting data on so many different skeletal elements will help me to better assess their overall adaptations. Furthermore, the inclusion of the unpublished material and isolated specimens will provide a more complete picture of the species diversity at these early human sites and the pressures that shaped our evolution. Preliminary results from this project have been presented at domestic and international conferences and the first chapter of my dissertation is in preparation for publication. Finally, this project involves collaboration with undergraduate, graduate, and professional scientists from all over the world providing research opportunities for students and fostering the types of broad relationships necessary for conducting responsible and inclusive science in today's world.

"Many anatomical and physiological characteristics of modern humans are thought to have evolved through changes in the timing of early growth and development, and the mouse is a primary model organism for studying such changes. This dissertation project will develop more accurate methods for determining the developmental age of mice during embryogenesis and investigate changes in developmental timing that may have driven the evolution of anatomical features that separate modern humans from their closest relatives and ancestors. The age estimation methodology produced by this research will be integrated into a freely available, online staging tool. Research conducted within the scope of this project will also help to create opportunities for female undergraduate and high school students to gain valuable experience in data collection and analysis, and to present original research at local and national symposia.

The purpose of this research is to address long-standing questions about how changes in the timing of development, either in the rate, the onset time, or the offset time of the development of specific anatomical features during embryogenesis, affect adult morphology. Experimental systems provide a potentially illuminating context to address these questions, but the inability to estimate the relative developmental age of an embryo with precise temporal resolution remains a significant problem. This project will establish a staging system that will precisely estimate the relative development of an embryo in hours, an order of magnitude more precise than existing developmental staging systems. The method, which will estimate developmental ages between embryonic day 9 and embryonic day 15 (E9-E15) using only a photograph of the mouse hindlimb, represents an easy-to-implement tool that mitigates interobserver error. The staging system will then be used to determine the extent to which human-specific anatomy, such as the reduced projection of the face, is produced by a shift in developmental timing, by studying the rate and timing of developmental events in mice carrying mutations that simulate changes in facial anatomy that occurred in human evolution. The results of this research will provide valuable and necessary clarification of the relationships among genotype, phenotype, and timing of developmental events, producing innovative solutions to questions about the nature of human development.",NSF,Pennsylvania State Univ University Park,PA,31355,1650824,jta10@psu.edu,Joan,Richtsmeier,1,"A major aim of this project was to examine the historically based idea that humans resemble juvenile apes because they develop more slowly than their ape counterparts. We tested this using a novel experimental and laboratory mice that can be bred over relatively short periods of time. We used mice carrying a mutation that caused changes in shape and relative proportions of the head that resemble those that occured during human evolution (reduced projection of the face, rounded skull when viewed from above). We were able to show that mice whose heads changed in ways similar to shape changes seen in skulls during human evolution do not develop more slowly than their typically developing littermates. This suggests that the changes seen in human evolution do not require a reduced rate of development to occur.

In addition, we identified a genetic combination (the interaction of two genetic mutations) in one of our mouse strains that is associated with a decreased rate of development compared to their genetically normal littermates. This result is important because it shows that specific combinations of genetic mutations can alter the pace of developmental events, despite the fact that none of the individual mutations affect developmental timing in isolation.

To enable a test of changes in rate and timing of development we needed to develop a staging system that enabling the sorting of specimens according to their level of development. We produced a freely-available on-line tool to estimate the level of development of mouse embryos aged embryonic day 10-15 (E10-E15) called the embryonic Mouse Ontogenetic Staging System (eMOSS). This tool is designed to assist researchers by enabling them to order their specimens according to their level of development (that does not always correspond with chronological age), and also allows for comparisons between research projects done by different labs and/or projects using different strains of mice.

This research addresses a number of broader impacts. The major technical accomplishment of this research, the eMOSS staging system, is free for other researchers to use at https://limbstaging.embl.es/, providing a valuable tool for researchers working in developmental biology without imposing a financial burden on institutions with fewer financial resources. This project has also provided the opportunity for training of several female undergraduates in valuable research methods and project design, supporting the Richtsmeier Lab?s goal of enabling the early careers of female scientists. Images generated during this project have been used in presentations at several undergraduate classes at Penn State, and will be used in education presentations in primary and secondary educational settings as well.

"In human childbirth, the baby fits very tightly in the birth canal, and anthropologists are interested in understanding what evolutionary pressures may have led to a female pelvic size and shape that can contribute to difficult childbirth. This project will test the thermoregulation hypothesis, which suggests that the width of the human pelvis is limited by the need to maintain a narrow body that is good at staying cool. Human ancestors evolved in warm climates and engaged in strenuous activities, and a narrow body aids in temperature regulation. Skeletal data on pelvic dimensions and temperature regulation data from living people will be collected to address the thermoregulation hypothesis. These data may also be informative for predicting women at risk of obstructed labor and for preventing overheating in recreational and professional athletes. Additionally, this project will support STEM training for two female undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in science. Project results will be shared in local high schools and with the general public at the American Museum of Natural History.

The traditional explanation for the ""obstetrical dilemma,"" which asks why the modern human female birth canal has not expanded to make birth easier, is that a narrow pelvis is more efficient during bipedal locomotion. However, the thermoregulation hypothesis, which suggests that a narrow pelvis aids in thermoregulation during physical activity, has been discussed as a competing hypothesis. This research will investigate the potential role of thermoregulation in constraining the evolution of the birth canal. The investigators hypothesize that a narrow pelvis aids in thermoregulation in modern humans during physical activity, that hip breadth is correlated with the area of the birth canal, and that Homo erectus was a narrow-bodied, heat-adapted taxon. The investigators will collect thermoregulation data from runners to determine if a narrow pelvis bestows thermoregulatory advantages during exercise; measure female pelvic dimensions using three-dimensional scans created from eco-geographically varied populations; and reconstruct the KNM-WT 15000 H. erectus pelvis, which is controversial because the original reconstruction provides the only evidence of a hominin with a narrow pelvis prior to the evolution of Homo sapiens. These data will contribute to a broader understanding of the evolutionary reasons behind obstructed labor.",NSF,New York University,NY,25128,1650895,sawilliams@nyu.edu,Scott,Williams,1,"Bipedal locomotion evolved in the hominin lineage around six million years ago. This functional requirement wrought substantial changes on the morphology of the pelvis. Millions of years later, encephalization (brain size) increased dramatically and a pelvis under the constraints that bipedal locomotion placed upon it had to adapt to birthing highly-encephalized babies. The term ""obstetric dilemma"" was coined to explain the high incidence of obstructed labor in modern humans as being due to a trade-off between maintaining effective and efficient bipedality while enabling successful parturition (birth). However, this explanation has recently been criticized. A lack of evidence that an increase in birth canal size would significantly increase locomotor cost has renewed interest in alternative candidates for an antagonistic selective pressure that could have prevented the birth canal from increasing in size to the point where obstructed labor no longer presented a significant problem.

 

Obstructed labor occurs when the birth canal is too small for the perinate to successfully complete the series of rotations necessary to exit the birth canal, and is a significant contributor to both maternal and perinatal injury and death. The global health burden of obstructed labor has therefore led anthropologists to question how long cephalopelvic disproportion (when the maternal birth canal is too small to accommodate the baby’s cranium) has been a significant issue for hominins. Birth in humans’ closest living relatives, the African great apes (chimpanzees and gorillas), is relatively easy which suggests that a relatively high incidence of obstructed labor evolved in the hominin lineage.

 

This research is motivated by the inability to explain obstructed labor in an evolutionary framework. As reproduction is fundamental to the survival of any species, logic dictates that natural selection should have eliminated this problem by favoring females with capacious birth canals. However, the pelvis is a complicated structure that plays a role in not just obstetrics but also locomotion, posture, visceral support, and thermoregulation. Trade-offs in morphology may be necessary if the pelvis is to function effectively in all these capacities, perhaps entailing that the birth canal cannot expand without impeding the ability of the pelvis to function in its other roles. As the pelvis is subject to a complex array of pressures, this research touches on many different aspects of evolution which are synthesized in order to gain a holistic understanding of pelvic evolution. This research utilizes comparative morphology, geometric morphometrics, and human subject research to test the role each of these pressures has played in shaping the modern human pelvis.

 

Thermoregulation has long been invoked as a possible explanation for cephalopelvic disproportion, but the link between pelvic morphology and body temperature has yet to be established. By empirically testing the relationship between pelvic width at the hips (bi-iliac breadth) and core body temperature during exercise in a sample of human subjects this study found evidence of a significant, positive relationship between bi-iliac breadth and resting temperature as well as maximum temperature, which indicates that a narrower bi-iliac breadth does assist in the maintenance of a lower body temperature. This is the first study to establish this link, despite thermoregulation being invoked as a significant determinant of pelvic width for a long time.

 

However, the hypothesis that the outcome of thermoregulatory selection is a smaller birth canal relies upon an untested connection between bi-iliac breadth and birth canal size. Through the study of modern human skeletonized pelves, this study found that bi-iliac breadth is significantly correlated with birth canal size, but the correlation is only high for the birth canal inlet. Yet of the three birth canal planes (inlet, midplane, and outlet), the midplane is generally the smallest and therefore the most likely to cause obstructed labor. Therefore, the link between bi-iliac breadth and obstetric difficulties is complicated, and thermoregulation may not represent a strong enough antagonistic pressure to have constrained birth canal enlargement.

 

The evolutionary causes behind obstructed labor therefore remain puzzling and further research is necessary to explain modern human female birth canal size in the context of the reduction in reproductive fitness it can be responsible for. One path to unraveling the obstetric dilemma involves studying the fossilized remains of hominins. Through the study of a morphological trait on the pelvis that is present in two adult females from the early African hominins genus Australopithecus it was determined there is evidence of stress placed on the pelvis due to its bipedal adaptations and function in the support of viscera and gestating fetuses.

 

The rate of perinatal and maternal mortality and injury due to the tight fit of the baby in the maternal birth canal remains a significant global burden even in the advent of modern medicine. This research helps to shed some light on the evolutionary origins of this problem.

"Socioeconomic status (SES) has long been known to mediate exposure to hazards and disease, as well as access to those resources necessary for growth, development, tissue maintenance, and immune response. However, the connection between SES and mortality is often oversimplified, and, in extreme cases, could misinform health policy and treatment protocols about the risks faced by individuals in a variety of contexts. Biological anthropology is well-equipped to explore the variability of patterns of SES and heath in the past by interpreting the results of bioarchaeological research in light of current theoretical perspectives espoused by public health researchers investigating the connection between SES and health in living populations. This project provides a novel model for exploring SES in past societies and will broaden understanding of the effects of SES across time by focusing on a context that differs from the modern, industrialized populations to which these theoretical perspectives have been applied. As a result, this multidisciplinary project will advance research in biological anthropology and extend the temporal purview of public health research by incorporating intersectionality theory into a study of past health. Moreover, the work will train a female graduate student and contribute to public science outreach efforts in both the United States and the United Kingdom.

This dissertation project uses skeletal samples to examine the interactions of SES, demographic characteristics (such as age and sex), exposure to physiological stressors, and mortality in the context of industrialization in 19th century England. Skeletal data from four industrial-era cemeteries (Coach Lane, St. Bride's Fleet Street, St. Peter's Wolverhampton, and New Bunhill Fields) will be analyzed with paleodemographic approaches (hazard modeling, hierarchical log-linear analysis, and analysis of variance) to determine how morbidity and mortality patterns in industrial England differed between SES groups; investigate how physiological stressors throughout life interacted with socially meaningful categories such as age and sex to produce layered marginalizations that influenced frailty and mortality in industrial England; and evaluate the potential of stressors underrepresented in biological anthropology literature to enhance understanding of marginalization, intersectionality, and mortality in the past.",NSF,University of South Carolina at Columbia,SC,24074,1649757,dewittes@mailbox.sc.edu,Sharon,DeWitte,1,"Because it mediates access to resources and exposure to hazards and disease, socioeconomic status (SES) is considered one of the most powerful predictors of mortality. However, the connection between SES and mortality is often oversimplified and overlooks the potential for multiple types of marginalization to be layered within a single individual. To avoid uncritically applying modern patterns of SES and health onto the past, this study integrated theoretical perspectives used in modern public health research with analytical tools and methodologies from bioarchaeology and paleodemography to evaluate how age, sex, SES, and previous health influenced morbidity and mortality in industrializing England. In an analysis of over 1140 individuals, this project compared a high SES skeletal sample in London (St. Bride?s Fleet Street, 1740-1852) to middle- and low-SES skeletal collections from London (New Bunhill Fields, 1821-1853), North Shields (Coach Lane, 1711-1857), and Wolverhampton (St. Peter?s Wolverhampton, c. 1819-1850s) to examine the interactions of SES, demographic characteristics (such as age and sex), exposure to physiological stressors, and mortality in the context of industrialization in 19th-century England.

The results of this project are informative about how, historically, industrialization and the rigidification of SES groups affected health in human populations and which subpopulations are most at risk during this process. The results of the 2- and 3-way ANOVA tests and the hierarchical log-linear analyses indicate that indicators of physiological stress in childhood and adolescence (fluctuating asymmetry, tooth size, vertebral neural canal size, linear enamel hypoplasia, and cribra orbitalia) were significantly associated with particular SES, sex, and age groups. Asymmetry of the face and skull, for example, was more pronounced among males in the samples, suggesting that males were particularly prone to environmental disturbances during development or were less able to buffer against them. This result may be linked to biological factors that may make males more prone to disease and physiological disruption, or may be linked to a cultural factors that predisposed developing males to hazardous working conditions and environments. Importantly, some of the results indicated key intersections of multiple categorizations at which individuals be at greater risk than if the two categories (e.g., sex and age) were considered separately. For example, the presence of periosteal lesions on the tibia was not associated with sex or age as distinct subjects of inquiry, but the periosteal lesions were associated with the intersection of sex and age. This result suggests that sex and age combined to influence the risk of developing the lesions in industrializing England despite not being significantly associated with the lesion?s presence on their own.

The results of this project demonstrate the importance of analytical approaches that allow for the examination of heterogeneity and intersectionality in past populations. Approaches like hazard modeling, hierarchical log-linear analysis, and multi-way ANOVA tests expose variation in mortality patterns among subpopulations, revealing the disproportionate effects of industrialization and SES-inequality. Importantly, this project provides a model for how bioarchaeological techniques may be used to communicate with and historically contextualize the findings of intersectional studies of modern populations. The results from this project can potentially benefit modern populations by informing public health strategies in areas currently experiencing industrialization or that have experienced industrialization in the past, specifically by identifying groups that may be or have been disproportionally affected by the process.

This project contributed to diversity in STEM research by supporting the continued training of a female doctoral student in data collection and interpretation and providing additional experience with the use of advanced paleodemographic and statistical techniques, as well as sex estimation and age estimation using transition analysis. This project facilitated public outreach, as the results have been and will continue to be presented in several talks that are open to the general public. Further, the results will be presented in full at professional conferences and published in several peer-reviewed articles, and an effort will be made to ensure that as many of the articles as possible are open access and thus freely available to the general public.
