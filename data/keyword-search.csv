The need to minimize anthropogenic CO2 emissions and our dependence on foreign fossil fuels has been a main driver for the discovery and development of renewable and sustainable production of fuels and chemicals from other sources. Toward this goal, non-edible lignocellulosic biomass (plant biomass composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) is a promising renewable feedstock since it is abundant, does not directly compete with the food chain, can lead to nearly carbon-free processes with concomitant reduction in CO2 emissions, and contains the building block of chemicals and fuels, i.e., carbon. 

It has been estimated that the annual crude oil demands in the US are of the same order of magnitude as the potentially available quantities of lignocellulosic materials and the throughput of chemicals is significantly lower, compared to fuels, and can easily be met. The recent boom in shale gas reduces our dependence on foreign petroleum, but also reduces the cracking of naphtha and thus, the production of C3-C6 chemicals from fossil fuels. One such example is BTX (Benzene, Toluene, Xylenes). Among BTX constituents, p-xylene (pX) is of great interest since it is the foundation for terephthalic acid (a polymer precursor for PET bottles used for the vast majority of food and liquid containers) and has an annual global demand of ~35 million metric tons/yr in 2010. The consumption of PET is expected to increase by 4-5%/yr over the next five years. pX has a similar number of carbon atoms to the building blocks of lignocellulose, and thus, its renewable production is an appealing target and forms the basis of the case study of the proposed work. 

Penetration of biomass based chemicals into existing markets requires that their production is sustainable and cost competitive to that of the petrochemical counterparts. Economic analysis and life cycle analysis (LCA) are often conducted to evaluate new biomass-based processes. It is emphatically the case that such predictions (including our own work) are based on rudimentary information, e.g., overall yield, and as such, are very uncertain. Currently, catalysts, solvents, and separation schemes are by-and-large discovered by trial and error. This situation is reminiscent of the genesis of oil industry that was followed by a century of discovery to evolve to its current mature stage. 

In order to realize renewable routes in the foreseeable future, a paradigm shift in philosophy and strategy is necessary that leverages recent scientific advances and core capabilities. It is the thesis of this research that a symbiotic program between systems analysis and fundamental science can lead to knowledge-based discovery and rapid commercialization while advancing scientific frontiers. This grand challenge-based vision defines the intellectual merit of the proposed program.

Intellectual Merit: To meet this grand challenge-based objective, a ""hierarchical multiscale"" program is planned, where systems analysis is informing the fundamental science of key processes and parameters, and the science team is performing experiments and simulations to collect this much needed knowledge to reduce systems uncertainty and render systems predictions reliable. In simple terms, the systems analysis focuses the space of scientific research and accelerates knowledge generation, where it makes sense to have, and the science in turn makes economic and life cycle analyses more reliable. The conversion of biomass-derived sugars to para-xylene has been selected as a representative case study. 

Broader Impact: The proposed work will have impact on the specific domain of catalytic kinetics, separation technology, systems analysis, and the overall goal of establishing a sustainable manufacturing route of valuable chemicals from lignocellulose. The introduction of renewable chemicals can have a major impact on US economic development and sustainability. Similar to petro-based refineries, process synthesis will unavoidably play a vital role in sustainable and cost-effective biorefineries. The hierarchical multiscale program proposed herein can also pave the way of future research efforts between disciplines toward accelerated discovery and genesis of knowledge where is most impactful. The results will be disseminated broadly through publications, lectures, and integration of research findings within the graduate and undergraduate curricula of the two institutions involved. Graduate students will be trained in interdisciplinary science, including catalysis, reaction engineering, separation sciences, and process systems engineering, by establishing a new way of thinking in the development of a sustainable chemical process. In addition, the PIs will broaden participation of students from underrepresented groups and provide an enriching experience to K-12 students through a variety of educational activities.","Newark","University of Delaware","47.041","202410","Proc Sys, Reac Eng & Mol Therm","2005905","mgi@udel.edu","Marianthi","Ierapetritou","11/19/2019","09/01/2019","06/30/2021","SusChem Collaborative Research: Process Optimization of Novel Routes for the Production of bio-based Para-Xylene","BIO"

The objective of this project is to enhance NC A&T's research and educational capability in the area of bio-based materials through integrating an innovative and novel International I-Corps (I2-Corps) program into graduate students' research and education to 1) accelerate research and discovery in bio-based materials via international partnerships, 2) ensure relevance of research to industry applications, and 3) enhance student's global awareness via synchronized scientific research, customer discovery, and market analysis. The effort is centered on a potentially transformative approach to capacity building in research and education through developing a research niche at NC A&T State University that addresses the needs of the bio-economy of 2030. This is to be achieved through strengthening the core competency of NC A&T State University in research in Sustainable Bio-materials through integrating technological innovation utilizing the NSF I-Corps model in an international context.

Bio-based materials are to be investigated, developed, and deployed through an integrated approach utilizing experiments and modeling. The modeling will use molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory. International collaboration is a key for realization of the vision in a holistic manner, because sustainable resources are location-specific, and their localized accessibility and abundance promotes specific bio-mass conversion expertise and bio-materials knowledge development in the respective region or country. For instance, while the U.S. team has experience in extracting molecular species from animal manure, the partners in France have experience working with algae, and the Danish and Brazilian partners have worked with jojoba oil and castor oil, respectively. international collaboration will bring together the complementary expertise necessary to address the challenge of engineering bio-material from bio-waste.","Tempe","Arizona State University","47.041","132619","EnvS-Environmtl Sustainability","2011135","mahour.parast@asu.edu","Mahour","Parast","12/05/2019","09/15/2019","07/31/2023","EAGER HBCU: Feasibility Study for International Research, Education and Workforce Development on Sustainable Bio-materials Using NSF I-Corps Framework","BIO"
"Aquatic systems are highly interconnected, which allow fish to traverse long distances, to dive through a water column, and, for some species, to move between fresh and saltwater environments. There is critical and urgent need for long-life unremitting fish monitoring technologies that can help with understanding fish behavior, selecting offshore wind farm sites, operating hydroelectric power plants, and assessing environmental impacts of marine hydrokinetic energy systems. The total market value of global telemetry including fish telemetry tags is estimated to reach $243 billion by 2020. Current fish telemetry tags are constrained by the limited lifetime of batteries, and periodic battery replacements are expensive and harmful to the fish. Another challenge is how to attach these tags to a fish with minimum impact on its normal life. Implanting a tag inside a fish body constitutes a complicated surgery process with the risk of impeding the fish life, and the mechanical clamping to the fin may negatively affect the fish motions. Therefore, this proposal aims at investigating a self-powered strategy and a bio- inspired attachment method for fish telemetry tags through energy harvesting from the surrounding fluid and fish maneuvering.

The goals of this GOALI project are to design and validate a novel bio-inspired attachment with a minimal influence on fish life and mobility and a bio-inspired broadband energy harvester to achieve a self-powered fish telemetry tag. The proposed bio-inspired fish tag consists of a bio-inspired bi-stable energy harvester, a bio-inspired sucking disc, an acoustic transmitter, and an integrated circuit board that contains both the transmission circuit, sensors, and the energy-harvesting management circuit.  Particularly, the principle behind the Venus flytrap will be fully understood to investigate the snap-through dynamics of the proposed bi-stable galloping piezoelectric harvester subjected to the combined excitations from fish maneuver and fluid flow. The remora-shark ""symbiotic relationship"" will be studied and used to guide the design of the bio-inspired sucking pad with stiff metal-based teeny spikes (in mimic the lamellar spinules) to attach the harvester on the fish. The specific work scope includes (1) a bio-inspired design of an attachment mechanism and a self-power sensing and communication system, (2) modeling of the fluid-structure-piezoelectric interaction, (3) the bio-inspired dynamics of the bi-stable piezoelectric energy harvester under complex excitations, and (4) experimental validation on robotic fish, live fish, and on-site demonstrations to investigate the performance and the influence of harvester on the fish life and mobility. The research is integrated with an educational and outreach plan, including course development, undergraduate research, K-12 students and teachers, and opportunities for minorities and women. The active collaboration between the two universities and industry will guide fundamental research to solve a critical industry need and enable wide dissemination and accelerated implementation of developed knowledge with immediate industry impacts.

"CBET - 1737620 (Fini, Elham).

This is a green engineering project that targets the enablement of the production of a bio-nanocomposite. The bio-nanocomposite is to be composed of montmorillonite clay and a bio-modifier made from swine manure. Use of such bio-based modifier can help reduce worldwide reliance on shrinking petroleum reserves while reducing CO2 emissions associated with the manufacture of petroleum-based products and the uncontrolled bio-waste decay in landfills and open lagoons.

The hypothesis to be tested is that that montmorillonite clay can be exfoliated using an amide-enriched bio-modifier made from swine manure to produce organo-clay containing individual silica nano-platelets. While the exfoliated clay can be used in multiple applications, this project aims to evaluate sustainability and technical feasibility of producing bio-based nano composite for use as construction materials. Accordingly, a secondary hypothesis is that introduction of the aforementioned bio-based nanocomposite into construction materials for outdoor applications such as roofing, sealing, building facades, roads and drive ways will have enhanced resistance to oxidative aging due to clay nano-particles playing as air barrier as well as carrier for certain bio-molecules with anti-aging properties. Accordingly, the project will examine environmental aspects of such outdoor applications along with technical feasibility. To do so, special attention will be given to study quality and quantity of the emissions during processing of bio-based nano composites as well as leachates during their application. Therefore, resulting material will be evaluated in terms of both associated thermo-mechanical properties and environmental aspects.","Tempe","Arizona State University","47.041","164051","EnvS-Environmtl Sustainability","1928807","Efini@asu.edu","Elham","Fini","03/19/2019","02/01/2019","08/31/2023","HBCU DCL: EAGER: Engineering A Sustainable Bio-based Nano Composite from Biomass Using A Bottom-up Synthesis and Characterization Approach","BIO"
"Our ability to rapidly manufacture bio-based solutions like therapeutics, materials, and bio-energy is crucial to our national economic advantage and national security. An agile national infrastructure to distribute the manufacturing of biological materials as well as provide the nation with a level of “bio-readiness” to address global pandemics and bio-threats is crucial in the 21st century. This research area will produce a distributed network of facilities, equipment, software, protocols, techniques, and personnel to develop applications and technology as well as to respond to bio-threats such as global warming and international pandemics. Sharing resources, software, training, personnel, and expertise will allow new centers to be created quickly in the face of national threats or economic needs. This effort will be inherently interdisciplinary and require computer scientists, material scientists, molecular biologists, government officials, legal expertise, and business leaders. It will include academic, government, and commercial partners at all scales. It will be a truly unique effort.

This proposal is to organize a six-session virtual workshop series to develop a coherent set of Needs, Opportunities, and Challenges for Bio-Manufacturing and Bio-Readiness. This workshop series will result in a set of interdisciplinary reports that will be communicated to the National Science Foundation for consideration as a “Convergence Accelerator” Future Topic. The ideas generated during this workshop series will impact commercial as well as academic developments and research in bio-manufacturing, bio-security, and bio-readiness. Workforce development will require new training and create new personnel positions as a response. Models of collaboration between academic research and commercial business will be altered along with the legal and government agencies required to make these connections happen. If successful, this effort will change how the United States views its national manufacturing abilities as well as how it responds to potential global threats in the future. As a result, a well-defined, accessible, and continuously evolving set of tools, techniques, software, hardware, and personnel will be available to the United States and, as appropriate, globally.

"Part 1
The NSF IRES BEAMS program will address the interest of the nation by advancing science and technology, developing U.S. students as leaders to address global challenges, and impacting people’s health and societal well-being. The significance of the program is to train U.S. students to enhance bio and electronic devices and materials important for healthcare diagnostics, cancer therapies, tissue engineering, drug delivery platforms, wearable and flexible sensors, edible electronics, energy efficiency, vision restoration, and real-time biological monitoring. The fundamental issues to be addressed by the NSF IRES BEAMS program includes providing an understanding of materials and device solutions to scientists and engineers for continued technological innovation; equipping scientists and engineers with an interdisciplinary research “toolbox” that will enable them to be at the forefront in developing novel bio and electronic systems; and preparing scientists and engineers to be creative and culturally and globally aware, to demonstrate leadership and integrity, and to use team-focused approaches to solve problems that stretch far beyond national boundaries.

The IRES-BEAMS Program will leverage synergistic research, education, and mentoring thrusts between leading research facilities at the University of South Florida (USF), the National Research Council of Italy - Institute for Polymers, Composites and Biomaterials (IPCB), and the Italian Institute of Technology Center for Nano Science and Technology (IIT-CNST), building upon pre-existing collaborative efforts with experts in materials and devices. This program will address scientific challenges for bio and electronic device materials leading the way for patient compliance and biological monitoring, regenerative disease, and wearable and flexible sensors, and many other healthcare technology platforms needed to advance humanity, prepare for future pandemics, and improve quality of life. Several strategies will be employed to engage participants and to proactively recruit diverse participants from NSBE, SHPE, SWE, USF REU, NSF Florida-Georgia LSAMP, USF NSF FGLSAMP Bridge to Doctorate, USF Sloan UCEM, and Florida A&M University’s NSF CREST. Students, faculty, and global partners will engage in diverse thought and innovation on a global level and foster professional  networks, academic collaborations, and funding proposals.

Part 2
Preparing global technology leaders in the area of advanced material systems will address many of the grand challenges of engineering and foster a highly-skilled, domestic workforce in areas of national need. To support this effort, the IRES-BEAMS Program (US-Italy International Research Experience for Students for Bio and Electronic Advanced Material Systems) focuses on advanced materials for bio and electronic devices. IRES-BEAMS leverages ongoing research and mentoring initiatives between the Advanced Materials Bio and Integration Research (AMBIR) group at the University of South Florida and the National Research Council of Italy - Institute for Polymers, Composites and Biomaterials (CNR-IPCB), and the Italian Institute of Technology Center for Nano Science and Technology (IIT-CNST), both among Italy’s top ten research organizations. The specific objectives of the IRES-BEAMS program are: Develop student “global competency”, teamwork, and leadership skills that will enable them to bridge cultural differences and collaborate effectively within multinational teams Expand student participation within international research to enhance their global engagement and preparedness for cutting-edge graduate programs (M.S., PhD.) Establish collaborative research projects of mutual interest to facilitate new long-term partnerships, funding proposals, future high-impact publications, patents, and student training opportunities
Provide students, particularly those from historically underrepresented backgrounds, with state-of-the art research-training in bio and nano electronics under the mentorship of international scientists to promote a diverse, globally-aware workforce in future and advanced manufacturing Intellectual Merit. The IRES-BEAMS program addresses transformational impacts of advanced materials utilized for fundamental and applied research in bio and nano electronics at the convergence of disciplines. Projects will be focused on two overarching themes: Design and Fabrication of Micro/Nano Scaled Fibers for BIO devices (CNR-IPCB) and ELECTRONIC devices (IIT-CNST). Several strategies will be used to recruit 6 U.S. students per year from diverse disciplines with an emphasis on the training of underrepresented minority participants. Efforts will identify undergraduate and graduate students from targeted programs and student organizations, including, NSBE, SHPE, SWE, USF REU, NSF LSAMP, NSF Florida-Georgia Bridge to Doctorate, USF Sloan UCEM, and FAMU’s CREST to recruit three cohorts. The IM will be mutually beneficial to students, faculty, and global partners. Students will gain exposure and training on electro fluid dynamic techniques (EFDTs), opportunities to engage in diverse thought and innovation on a global level. AMBIR, IPCB, and CNST labs will collect new data, characterize materials, analyze data, fabricate devices and publish findings in peer-reviewed journals (MRS, ACS, IEEE, Advanced Materials, and others), a benefit to all.

The IRES-BEAMS program will impact engineering education, student success, collaborative innovation, and functionalized materials development on the local, national, and international levels. The benefits of international engagement will strengthen a students’ global interconnectedness and awareness, cultural and language training, “comparative openness beyond the classroom to embrace and promote diversity”, STEM career readiness, and student empowerment. IRES-BEAMS will utilize websites, biweekly blogs, presentations, publications, ethical perspectives, social media (Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube), and K-12 outreach (EXPO) for dissemination to both scientific and lay audiences. Assessment and evaluation efforts will capture the impact of materials research on devicefabrication and longitudinal impact on student professional progression. Additional evaluations, aligned with subscales of the engineering global preparedness index, will provide further data on faculty and student research, mentoring, and professional development skills. IRES-BEAMS participants will be required to present their research annually during university research days and local/national research symposiums, and educational outcomes will be published/presented in STEM educational meetings/ proceedings/journals (Frontiers in Education, ASEE, Understanding Interventions that Broaden Participation in Science Careers,
and others).

"Research activities in the areas of (bio)materials science and engineering are a major focus of various universities and companies across the State of Utah and its surroundings. The proposed instrumentation seeks to provide an integrated laboratory beamline X-ray scattering tool comprising small-angle (SAXS), wide-angle (WAXS), and grazing incidence (GI) capabilities for the characterization of (bio)materials. This instrument is the first-open access facility fitted for in-situ characterization of bio(materials) in the Intermountain West region and it will be used by numerous research programs at large institutions (R1 and R2), undergraduate institutions, as well as in-state and out-of-state companies. The instrument enables research activities by a diverse and large group of faculty and students within Chemistry, Mines & Earth Sciences, Engineering, Pharmacy, and the School of Medicine. Highlighted research activities facilitated by this instrumentation include investigation of materials for sensing and energy harvesting; protein folding; catalysts for synthesis and combustion of advanced fuels; next-generation wireless neural interfaces such as in artificial vision; single-molecular diagnostics; and quantum electronic materials. The instrument will also facilitate the education and training of students and researchers in advanced characterization techniques. Additionally, most research groups and industry efforts have started to shift their research programs into the implementation of in-situ and in-operando approaches to help investigate (bio)materials failure and performance under dynamic conditions which are capabilities that this instrument will enable. More importantly, students and postdocs across many institutions will strongly overlap with scientists at regional companies and government laboratories which will allow them to seek internships and job opportunities.

The SAXS/WAXS tool will meet the critical research, education, and training needs of various research and teaching institutions in the Intermountain West region. The principal use of the instrument will be to characterize the morphology and structure of a broad range of (bio)materials such as, conducting organic thin films, petroleum-based structures, nanocomposites, nanoparticles, organic-inorganic hybrid materials, bioparticles, protein folding/interfaces, biological systems, and mesoporous materials. The proposed SAXS/WAXS tool will include several accessories for in-situ and in-operando measurements and will allow for simultaneous SAXS and WAXS studies of solids, pastes, liquids, and thin films in both transmission and reflection modes which are vitally needed given the broad user base. About 44 faculty members at 7 universities, 1 national laboratory, as well as 7 companies have expressed their strong interest and support for having a SAXS/WAXS system readily available that could help minimize trips to the synchrotron facilities or for screening and optimizing samples prior to a more specialized synchrotron experiment. The location of the SAXS/WAXS instrument within the Nanofabrication, Nanoscale Imaging and Surface Analysis core facility laboratory at the University of Utah will boost the research of regional companies, promote collaborative research, enhance existing laboratory outreach activities to underrepresented students in STEM fields, and expand educational programs. The proposed instrument will also be of great benefit to smaller institutions in the State of Utah and its surroundings that cannot afford out-of-state travel to synchrotron facilities. The Nanofabrication, Nanoscale Imaging and Surface Analysis core facility laboratory at the University of Utah will organize an annual workshop where faculty and students will give oral presentations on research activities enabled by the SAXS/WAXS instrument.

"Research Catalyst projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at Prairie View A&M University focuses on developing 3D printing technology to manufacture bio-fiber reinforced composite materials; and provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to enhance their education through research experiences. The researcher has established a strong collaboration with faculty at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute. 

The goal of this research is to utilize the laminated object manufacturing (LOM) technology for rapid prototyping laminated bio-composite parts that are made from bio-fiber reinforcements and bio-resin matrix, which can be used as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional, non-biodegradable advanced composite parts in industrial prototyping/manufacturing applications. A functional LOM 3D printer will be designed and built, which uses bio-prepregs made from selected woven bio-fiber and bio-resin that is partially cured as starting work materials for the LOM process. This process will involve the design of experiments, optimization of work material composition, individual process result comparisons, design for manufacturing and assembly, as well as closed-loop control theory implementations. The qualitites of 3D printed bio-parts will be assessed based on their geometric accuracies and mechanical properties, which will be compared to the original input model, as well as 3D printed parts made from other common rapid prototyping technologies and materials. This research seeks to use 100% biodegradable composite materials for rapid prototyping purposes to achieve similar or better part quality results than regular 3D printing strategies, as well as reduce the carbon footprint of the process. The idea of using biodegradable materials for rapid prototyping processes will also act as an excellent guide for 'green' manufacturing process developments in the future.

"Scientific discovery depends on the accumulation of knowledge. There are thousands of articles on any given topic, but no one person can read them all. This limitation is more important in the COVID-19 era, where dependable knowledge can mean the difference between life and death. This project works to improve methods related to the synthesis of scientific knowledge by developing a visual dashboard to summarize COVID-19 related research efforts. The main goal is to integrate a current COVID-19 literature dataset from the Whitehouse with a knowledge graph from PubMed and a drug discovery knowledge graph developed by Data2Discovery. This would enable the creation of the “Fight COVID-19 Dashboard,” a visualization tool that would centralize and visualize crucial, up to date data and scientific information related to COVID. This dashboard will help scientists and clinicians access and visualize the most recent information about COVID. Such information is also crucial for mining publications to generate research hypotheses and for identifying patterns of collaboration and innovation in scientific communication working to stop the spread of COVID. The PIs will make their data and the codes for constructing the dashboard open to the public to enable future efforts and enhance public trust in science through transparency.

This project develops the Fight COVID-19 Dataset and visual dashboard to advance information science and aid in the fight against COVID-19. This is accomplished by integrating a current COVID-19 literature dataset from the White House with a knowledge graph from PubMed and a drug discovery knowledge graph interlinking dozens of publicly available databases in pre-clinical drug discovery. This dashboard will display COVID-19 related information, including: 1) the currently most mentioned biological entities (e.g., drugs, diseases, vaccines, genes) in PubMed and clinical trials; 2) the evolution of related biological entities according to PubMed literature and clinical trials; 3) the network connections of related biological entities; 4) the lists of active scientists, teams, and institutions and their research topics; and 5) collaborations of scientific teams to enable networking and inspire potential collaborations to fight against COVID-19. This research will advance textual analysis methods by moving beyond keyword analysis towards advanced understanding of the objects that the keywords indicate and propelling textual methods towards knowledge graph-based analysis. It also adds a longitudinal element to recent investigations of the evolving pathway of COVID-19 scientific studies related to bio entities and links the science of science to related research domains in new and potentially innovative ways.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from development of a safe and sustainable anti-viral treatment for COVID-19. Vaccine and drug development efforts are underway, but the efficacy of these treatments and their safety particularly for high-risk populations remain a concern. The proposed project is an anti-viral inhaler that delivers a natural immune defense salivary protein that blocks the activity of a molecule essential for viral replication in the lung. The candidate therapeutic will potentially be a safer treatment option for people with compromised health. The sustainability of this treatment relies on three factors. First, the therapeutic targets a viral genome replication process. Thus, this targeted technology will not be compromised by virus mutations and will maintain its efficacy against current and future coronavirus outbreaks. Second, it does not require clinical administration and is thus more easily accessible by patients. Third, the treatment has potential as an broad anti-viral therapy.

The proposed project will validate a novel anti-viral treatment against SARS-CoV-2.  First, the anti-viral action will be validated in a cell-based model that mimics human lung infected with coronavirus, alveolar epithelial cells cultured in an air-liquid interface and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Next, an in vivo model will be used to confirm that the therapy can reach the virus target site in the lung, undergo uptake by the alveolar epithelial cells and avoid the barriers of pulmonary delivery (e.g. mucus, pulmonary enzymes or macrophages). Finally, this project will confirm that the therapy does not elicit a pro-inflammatory response and toxicity in lung cells, so it can be safely given to people with compromised health without exacerbating their immune response. The treatment will be delivered by inhalation and ultimately become a therapeutic and prophylactic anti-viral inhaler.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to introduce a novel and renewably resource-derived polymer, Polyacrylated Glycerol (PAG), to the asphalt road maintenance industry.  The project will demonstrate the performance and efficiency of PAG to improve the performance and life expectancy of common asphalt maintenance applications.  If successful, this project will create a pathway to new demand for glycerol, a significant byproduct of the bio-diesel industry.  Furthermore, it will create the potential to replace up to 50,000 tons per year of petroleum-derived polymers with a green product having significant renewable content. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will explore the potential for PAG elastomers to perform as adhesion promoters, sealants, primers, and asphalt additives in asphalt roadway maintenance applications.  A series of laboratory produced PAG polymers with variations in molecular weight, average acrylic functionality, and residual acrylic acid comonomer content will be explored using  a series of laboratory-based tests designed to characterize performance of asphalt primers, seal coats, tack coats, micro surfacing, and chip seals modified with the PAG polymers.  In addition, this Phase 1 project will explore the potential to scale-up the manufacturing of the PAG polymer from a laboratory scale to pilot scale.

"The ERC for Advanced Technologies for the Preservation of Biological Systems (ATP-Bio) aims to “stop biological time” and radically extend the ability to bank and transport cells, aquatic embryos, tissue, skin, whole organs, microphysiological systems (“organs-on-a-chip”), and even whole organisms through a team approach to build advanced biopreservation technologies. In order to build a more robust and diverse STEM workforce, especially in the growing number of fields needing biopreservation technologies, ATP-Bio also aims for equitable STEM education across all components of the Center. As such, ATP-Bio’s workforce development plan is purposefully designed to promote interest and engagement in STEM for all students. ATP-Bio will engage middle schoolers and high schoolers with biopreservation science and technology, fund numerous research internships in ATP-Bio labs for undergraduates, sponsor dozens of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in ATP-Bio labs, and facilitate dozens of internships in the biopreservation industry. ATP-Bio will also include a focused effort on Ethics and Public Policy so that the Center’s technology will be legally and ethically translated to public benefit. Together with a large and active group of industrial partners, ATP-Bio aims to produce massive social benefit through “off-the-shelf” biopreservation technologies for cell therapies, tissue and organ transplantation, pharmacological research, aquaculture, biodiversity efforts, and many other fields.

ATP-Bio will accomplish its goals by engineering technologies for biological systems before cooling, during cooling and stasis at subzero temperatures, and during rewarming to normal biological temperatures. At each stage, ATP-Bio convergent science teams will aim to eliminate or control ice formation, mitigate the toxicity of cryopreservation agents, and eliminate thermal and mechanical stress. The integration of Engineering and Workforce Development and Diversity and Culture of Inclusion across all components of ATP-Bio is aimed at creating a more diverse STEM workforce that understands team science, especially for the growing number of fields needing biopreservation technologies. ATP-Bio will leverage the long-term nature of an ERC to conduct research on developing positive STEM identity for all students and improving STEM pathways for K-12 and undergraduate STEM education, especially for women and minorities under-represented in academic and industrial STEM fields. ATP-Bio will also include focused research on Ethics and Public Policy so that the Center’s technology will be legally and ethically translated to public benefit.

"The study and identification of quantum phenomena in biological systems is an interdisciplinary field that has attracted increasing attention in the past few decades but hasn't developed as robustly as needed. The main goal of this proposal is to gather experts in nanofabrication, quantum optics, single molecule biophysics, energy harvesting, physical chemistry, theoretical and experimental quantum biology to understand how quantum behavior affects bio-molecular function.  This workshop will bring young and senior scientists together from different scientific disciplines. The proposal will explore questions such as measurements of quantum coherence about quantum dynamics in photosynthetic processes, impact of molecular environment on the preservation of quantum coherence for the function of such systems, engineering electro-optical devices beyond the current state of the art, realization of bio-inspired devices or algorithms to exploit quantum dynamics phenomenon and the use of synthetic biology methods to modify biomolecular systems to improve their quantum performance. This workshop will foster increased partnership between academia and industry and will aid in the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce.

"This award will develop a bio-mediated technique to reduce freezing and ice lens formation in soils using antifreeze proteins (AFPs) from psychrophilic (cold-loving) microorganisms. The moisture in the seasonally frozen ground, when subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, can develop large ice lenses that degrade the performance of civil infrastructure and affects land surface characteristics such as radiation balance and latent heat exchange. A significant amount of rehabilitation efforts, chemicals, and conservative design approaches are currently used to maintain cold-region infrastructure in serviceable conditions. Our solution is to extract AFPs from psychrophiles and use them to change the freezing characteristics of water in soil to prevent the formation of the detrimental ice lenses. The research will be complemented by establishing an educational and outreach program to engage undergraduate students in convergence research on bio-inspired solutions to complex engineering problems and incorporate cold-region bio-geotechnics in the curriculum.

The goal of this project is to investigate, optimize, and develop a bio-mediated sustainable approach to control the phase change transformations of the pore-water present in the porous media of seasonally frozen ground. The growth of ice-lenses in porous soil media is a complex thermomechanical process that depends on freezing rate, heat extraction, the equilibrium of thermal, mechanical, and chemical forces, and effective stress on soil skeleton. We will investigate the following specific objectives: (1) characterize the antifreeze properties of moderate to hyperactive AFPs from different psychrophiles; (2) investigate the bio-treated soils’ thermal characteristics including thermal hysteresis, phase changes, freezing point and evaluate corresponding ice inhibition, ice shaping, and ice recrystallization activities; and (3) evaluate the resiliency of the bio-mediated technique to freeze-thaw cycles and investigate the strength and deformation characteristics of the untreated and bio-treated soils. This project will advance the knowledge base in applications of AFPs, ice mechanics, and soil-ice interfaces to enhance resiliency of cold region infrastructure.

"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will explore the potential for incorporating bio-inspired principles from natural composites found in mollusks and arthropods with existing bio-cementation soil improvement to yield multifunctional, resilient, and sustainable bio-cemented composites for the improvement of weak and problematic soils. While bio-cementation has been shown to dramatically improve soil engineering behaviors, the presence of cementation can also result in some potentially unfavorable responses including rapid strength and stiffness losses. This project will draw inspiration from the structure and mechanisms associated with mechanically superior biogenic composites to modify existing bio-cementation and further enhance soil engineering behaviors to provide transformative benefits with respect to the environmental sustainability, economic efficacy, long-term resilience, and multifunctionality of geotechnical soil improvement and reliant civil infrastructure. Project education and outreach activities will address critical deficiencies in the pipeline of underrepresented minority students towards STEM-based higher education by: (1) increasing the awareness of underrepresented minority students of STEM fields, higher education, and careers through outreach at various venues including the Seattle Aquarium, (2) improving the recruitment of underrepresented minority students to STEM-based higher education through modules, mobile outreach toolkits, an academy for K-12 teachers, and implementation of content in classrooms, and (3) enhancing underrepresented minority student retention in STEM through research experiences, integration with support programs, and incorporation of project outcomes in curricula. Over 600 K-12 and community college students will be engaged annually from remote and diverse student populations. 

Project research will leverage small-scale biogeochemical experiments, reactive transport numerical modeling, triaxial and resonant column geotechnical laboratory tests, and advanced chemical, biological, and material analyses to: (1) explore the potential of bio-inspired principles to be translated to bio-cemented soils to achieve bio-cemented composites with enhanced fracture toughness, ductility, and strength, (2) investigate the engineering behaviors of bio-cemented composite treated soils including (a) pre-yielding, post-yielding, and critical state behaviors, (b) low-strain dynamic properties, and (c) liquefaction behaviors, (3) examine the ability of bio-cemented composites to provide new functionalities including contaminant removal and thermal and hydraulic enhancements, and (4) explore the resilience of bio-cemented composites to biogeochemical and mechanical stressors and the environmental and economic efficacy of composites relative to existing technologies. The project will advance the emerging field of bio-mediated soil improvement by leveraging novel bio-mediated processes and bio-inspired principles to develop new materials for geotechnical ground improvement that can improve the resiliency, sustainability, and multifunctionality of civil infrastructure.

"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to engineer sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based adhesives for use in construction and pavement.  The research objective of the project is to test the hypothesis that introducing bio-binder to asphalt binder can change the phase structure within asphalt binder to produce bio-modified binder (BMB) with desired rheological and surface characteristics.  Desired characteristics are an increase in BMB's adhesion strength and stress release rate, and a reduction of its viscosity at corresponding temperatures.  This in turn can improve pavement sustainability in several ways: 1) an increase in adhesion strength between binder and aggregate can reduce moisture damage in pavement, 2) an increase in binder's stress release rate can reduce low temperature cracking in pavement, and 3) a reduction in binder viscosity can facilitate use of reclaimed asphalt pavement and recycled asphalt shingles in paving mixtures.  It is hypothesized that when bio-binder is added to the asphalt binder, bio-binder molecules penetrate into the asphalt binder's matrix changing its chain conformation and molecular packing.  The interchain interactions between the long alkyl chains of the bio-binder and those of the asphalt molecules' side chains hinder the stacking of the aromatic cores of the asphalt molecules improving asphalt's properties.  Molecular dynamics simulations will be implemented to study how the two materials interact and how their interactions impact rheology, aging and adhesion characteristics of the bio-modified binder.  
This project opens a new paradigm in asphalt material characterization and modeling, enabling an integration of chemistry and mechanics while enhancing pavement sustainability and revolutionizing waste management practices for better environmental protection. It will offer a simultaneous approach to sequester carbon and address problems associated with manure management while improving pavement sustainability and enhancing U.S. economic competiveness by reducing dependence on petroleum resources.  The broader impact of the project will be further expanded by reaching audiences ranging from university educators to industry practitioners, farmers and K-12 deaf students to achieve educational goal of the project including 1) enhancing students' knowledge in the area of sustainable pavement and 2) providing professionals and decision makers with the scientific rationale underlying the use of bio-binder.","Tempe","Arizona State University","47.041","15000","Structural and Architectural E","1928795","Efini@asu.edu","Elham","Fini","04/02/2019","02/01/2019","07/31/2021","CAREER:  Integrated Research and Education to Improve Pavement Sustainability Using Bio-Binder","BIO"
"This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports fundamental research to explore a novel manufacturing system that is capable of 3D printing zinc-magnesium bio-alloys. These alloys are highly desirable in implanted medical devices for their biodegradability and high strength. However, powder fusion 3D printing of these bio-alloys is very difficult to control because of vaporization and oxidization under high power laser. Not having a direct printing process for zinc-magnesium bio-alloys makes it nearly impossible to manufacture custom devices. To overcome this hurdle, a new thixotropic 3D printing methodology in which the viscosity is controlled, could allow zinc-magnesium bio-alloys to be directly printed via an extrusion process into accurate, customized 3D shapes. The new technology is expected to benefit skeletal and soft tissue fixation tools, vascular inflation stents, and bone tissue scaffolds. This would lead to improvements in orthopedic, spinal and vascular surgery by providing patient-tailored medical devices that are strong and biodegradable/absorbable in the body. The new process may also be adapted to the fabrication of aluminum-based alloys for other industrial applications. The project will be used in educational outreach activities, especially to middle/high school and underrepresented minority students, to showcase high-tech bio-fabrication, biomaterials, and their surgical engineering applications.

Molten alloys have low viscosity but high surface tension, making stable 3D printing nearly impossible. It is hypothesized that a two-phase micro-slurry with a fine globular morphology can be created for zinc-magnesium bio-alloys by thixotropic processing, and this can effectively make the slurry suitable for 3D printing by extrusion. Three research tasks will be performed to test this hypothesis and establish the technical feasibility of the method: 1) Conduct basic research on alloy design, morphological formation, relation between thixotropy and printability, and relation of processing, structure and property in thixotropic extrusion and printing; 2) Study the process dynamics and develop modeling capability for thixotropic 3D printing; 3) Establish a laboratory setup for freeform fabrication of zinc-magnesium bio-alloys. Researchers will obtain fundamental understanding of the unique processing-structure-property relationships of the new thixotropic metal forming and 3D printing methods and the new zinc-magnesium bio-alloy. New scientific knowledge is particularly anticipated in the following areas: a) mechanisms of promoting thixotropy of alloys in semi-solid metal processing; b) fluid mechanics and rheology in high-stress mixing of alloys; c) fundamental relationships between thixotropy and printability in semi-solid-state deposition; and d) fundamental relationships of processing, structure and property regarding biodegradability and performance of a new zinc-magnesium bio-alloy.

"This INSPIRE project is jointly funded by the CMMI and CBET Divisions in the ENG Directorate, OISE, and the Office of Integrative Activities. This INSPIRE research studies the merits of using suitably balanced combinations of bio-mass sources to produce construction bio-adhesive. The biomass sources to be used are mostly algae cultivated in sewage and wastewater treatment plant facilities, woody biomass, and animal manure. The project simultaneously integrates environmental sustainability metrics into the bio-adhesive design process to enable sustainable developments focusing on the built environment. Considering the significant shortage of petroleum-based adhesives, the most accessible market for such bio-adhesives is envisioned to be the built environment such as building, roads and bridges. It should be noted that the price of petroleum-based adhesives such as bitumen often used in the built environment has been increasing dramatically within the last decade as its supplies have been shrinking significantly. Accordingly, bio-adhesives which are being developed in the EU and US could be a solution to reduce dependence of the construction industry on petroleum-based adhesives such as bitumen. In addition, production of bio-adhesives as proposed in this INSPIRE project can be a means of sequestering carbon from bio-mass waste which will be otherwise released back to the atmosphere as bio-mass decays. Therefore, in contrast to natural decay of bio-mass which is typically considered to be carbon neutral, the bio-adhesive process is carbon negative because more than 60% of carbon from bio-mass will be trapped in the bio-adhesive. 

Bio-adhesives will be produced from an array of molecular species found in bio-mass resources specially algae grown and harvested in wastewater treatment plants while simultaneously integrating environmental sustainability metrics as well as health and safety aspects. A thermochemical liquefaction process will be used, followed by solvent extraction, filtration and vacuum distillation to extract an array of molecular structures from a suitably balanced biomass feedstock. Density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations along with multi-scale experimental characterization will be used to inform synthesis and engineering of bio-adhesive with desirable performance. Molecular level insights will provide in-depth understanding of structure-property relationship to tailor bio-adhesives' performance for the sustainable built environment while promoting bio-economy and resource conservation.","Tempe","Arizona State University","47.041","646012","EnvS-Environmtl Sustainability","1935723","Efini@asu.edu","Elham","Fini","06/11/2019","04/26/2019","11/30/2023","INSPIRE: Engineering Sustainable Bio-adhesives from Algae for the Built Environment","BIO"
"This project takes major steps towards concretely defining core concepts and competencies outlined in the NSF-AAAS report, Vision and Change, and provides tools to allow programmatic assessment in undergraduate biology education. The intellectual merit of this project derives from the development, validation, and field-testing of tools called Bio-MAPS (Biology-Measuring Achievement and Progression in Science). Specifically, four Bio-MAPS assessments are being produced: molecular and cellular biology, physiology and neuroscience, ecology and evolution, and an overall comprehensive measure. The research team is working with biology faculty at diverse institutions that span the breadth of higher education to develop a framework that outlines expectations for what students should know and be able to do at different collegiate levels. 

Data from Bio-MAPS are expected to provide dramatic broader impacts and catalyze curricular reform by: 1) diagnosing areas in which students struggle despite instruction, 2) allowing two-year community colleges to evaluate how well they are preparing students for transfer to four-year institutions, 3) inspiring and directing faculty and institutional conversations about enacting change at the programmatic level, 4) helping administrators focus limited resources on aspects of the curricula needing revision, and 5) challenging faculty to re-design courses to scaffold student learning. Biology departments can also use Bio-MAPS assessments to demonstrate evidence of student learning for accreditation processes.

Many agencies now require evidence of student learning and data on how well programs meet the needs of diverse student populations. This focus on tangible learning outcomes requires that institutions have a means of quantitatively measuring student progression through a curriculum. Bio-MAPS can provide a means of measuring student progress through a curriculum. Other science disciplines may be interested in developing similar assessments for their students.

"This research will explore a novel approach for dune protection using bio-cementation to stabilize and enhance natural protective structures. Dunes often present the first line of defense for the built environment during extreme wave surge and storm events. In order to remain effective, dunes must resist erosion in the face of these incidents. Understanding the physics of dune erosion is critical for devising ways to mitigate it. The research team will explore multiple treatment implementation techniques and assess their performance under extreme conditions at field-scale in a large wave flume (LWF) at Oregon State University.  Dunes will be constructed in the LWF, bio-cemented in-place, and subjected to a series of wave inundations so that their performance may be observed and quantified.  The large-scale work will be supported by coupled laboratory and numerical investigations.  The numerical investigation will provide insight into the loading conditions for which each treatment implementation alternative is preferred and the treatment design (e.g., required treatment dimensions) to have minimal impact on the natural environment while still providing the required engineering performance.  The resulting outcome of this work will provide guidance for enhancing coastal dunes with bio-cementation to prevent damage to infrastructure during extreme events.

Bio-cementation may be a viable method to mitigate dune erosion, which in turn would protect coastal infrastructure during extreme events.  We will explore two approaches to implement bio-cementation. The first implementation technique will induce bio-cementation at depth within the dune; this will result in an uncemented surficial layer which may erode but will also minimally impact the coastal habitat.  The second approach will be geared towards rapid deployment, for example, in preparation for a forecasted storm event anticipated to hit vulnerable dunes.  This rapid approach will be sprayed onto the dunes, instead of injected, since this quick application is more likely to be implemented in a rapid deployment.  Furthermore, two methods to induce bio-cementation will be explored: microbial induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) and enzyme induced carbonate precipitation (EICP). The EICP implementation will be conducted by the NSF Engineering Research Center for Bio-mediated and Bio-inspired Geotechnics (CBBG).  The research approach will include near prototype-scale experiments in the NHERI Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory (HWRL); this is made possible by collaborating with an existing NSF project, Physics of Dune Erosion During Extreme Surge and Wave Events, which includes placing nearly 1000 tons of sand in the HWRL Large Wave Flume (LWF), the largest of its type in North America and in the top 10 in the world.  In addition to the experiments in the LWF, a complementary laboratory testing and integrated numerical modeling program are planned to assess the effects of implementation strategies with overall dune performance.  This research will advance bio-cementation technology by providing well-controlled and instrumented case studies to quantitatively compare the effect of implementation techniques on the performance of dunes. The resulting cementation patterns from the two treatment approaches are expected to be different; however, the performance of the two treatment approaches is unknown.  This approach will not only develop prototype-scale case studies of two different treatment implementations, but also provide case studies of bio-cemented sand dunes subjected to extreme storm loading conditions.  The numerical simulation approach will provide a framework to design and evaluate the stability of the bio-cementation under extreme wave loading.

"Two essential challenges faced globally by computing systems today are tremendous energy consumption and electronic wastes. One potential solution to simultaneously address these two issues is by “brain-like” and “green” neuromorphic computing with energy-efficient operation and biodegradable disposals. Neuromorphic computing systems require hardware components capable of mimicking human synapse - the basic building block of biological neural networks, while natural bio-organic materials derived from living or once-living organisms such as plants, animals or microbial materials are renewable, sustainable, biocompatible, biodegradable, and abundant in nature. The proposed research will advance the development of nanoscale, ultrahigh-density and wafer-level manufacturing of natural bio-organic materials based resistive random access memory through nanofabrication and machine learning, and implementation of bio-organic materials based resistive memory in neural networks with high accuracy and efficiency for “green” neuromorphic systems. This project has great impacts on US and global societies and provides many societal benefits. The neuromorphic systems using bio-organic materials based resistive memory are desirable for stretchable, flexible and wearable electronics in personal health and biomedical applications, and address the sustainable and environmental issues brought by excessive exploitation of non-renewable resources for electronics and disposal of electronic devices. The interdisciplinary nature of this research project covers the understanding and practice in nanotechnology, non-volatile memory, neuron and synapse, neuromorphic computing systems and machine learning, which provide a perfect venue for integration of research and education. Minority, female and high school students will be mentored to perform research in nanotechnology and machine learning. A virtual reality based interactive system will be developed to provide trainings of resistive memory and synaptic device fabrication in a virtual cleanroom environment.

"Two essential challenges faced globally by computing systems today are tremendous energy consumption and electronic wastes. One potential solution to simultaneously address these two issues is by “brain-like” and “green” neuromorphic computing with energy-efficient operation and biodegradable disposals. Neuromorphic computing systems require hardware components capable of mimicking human synapse - the basic building block of biological neural networks, while natural bio-organic materials derived from living or once-living organisms such as plants, animals or microbial materials are renewable, sustainable, biocompatible, biodegradable, and abundant in nature. The proposed research will advance the development of nanoscale, ultrahigh-density and wafer-level manufacturing of natural bio-organic materials based resistive random access memory through nanofabrication and machine learning, and implementation of bio-organic materials based resistive memory in neural networks with high accuracy and efficiency for “green” neuromorphic systems. This project has great impacts on US and global societies and provides many societal benefits. The neuromorphic systems using bio-organic materials based resistive memory are desirable for stretchable, flexible and wearable electronics in personal health and biomedical applications, and address the sustainable and environmental issues brought by excessive exploitation of non-renewable resources for electronics and disposal of electronic devices. The interdisciplinary nature of this research project covers the understanding and practice in nanotechnology, non-volatile memory, neuron and synapse, neuromorphic computing systems and machine learning, which provide a perfect venue for integration of research and education. Minority, female and high school students will be mentored to perform research in nanotechnology and machine learning. A virtual reality based interactive system will be developed to provide trainings of resistive memory and synaptic device fabrication in a virtual cleanroom environment. Workshops will be organized for broadening dissemination and community outreach.

"Computational techniques are drastically impacting the way in which scientific and engineering research are conducted. Impressive advances have been made in different areas including biology, medicine, and drug discovery. Given the great importance of these areas to the society at large, it is essential to advance the state-of-the art in them. Such advances can be made when the scientists from these domains work together and come up with the best possible diagnosis tools, treatment procedures, drugs for various diseases, etc. Even though a number of conferences exist today in the general area of bioinformatics, they focus on one of these three areas to a large extent. The Ninth International IEEE Conference on Computational Advances in Bio and medical Sciences (ICCABS) has the goal of bringing together scientists in biology, medicine, and drug discovery and hence serving as a collaboration platform for them. These collaborations are likely to result in the solution of some of these challenging problems.

The requested funds will be used to support the travel expenses of graduate students. These students will get to meet experts and listen to their research results. Not only will the attending students but so will their colleagues at their home institution, since when attendees return to their schools they will communicate their experiences with other students. The conference proceedings will be of great use to students, researchers, and practitioners. Journal special issues are also planned.

"Controlling cell differentiation is critical when manufacturing products for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In the body, cell differentiation is governed by patterns of biochemical and mechanical features in tissues. Numerous techniques have been proposed to mimic these patterns, but their precision and reproducibility need improvement. In this effort, the research team aims to establish a new technology to build biochemical patterns directing the differentiation of intestinal stem cells, which are important for understanding gastrointestinal function and disease. Differentiated cells will be harvested and used as building blocks to construct models of the gut wall. The results of this effort will transform our understanding of how tissue biochemistry determines cell behaviors in the intestine. This will in turn provide a unique toolbox to formulate new “biomaterial recipes” for manufacturing cells that are “regenerative medicine-ready."" To broaden impact, the technological outcomes of this research will be integrated in academic curricula, new tutorials via the Comparative Medicine Institute, and create ad hoc courses on cell production for biotech professionals. The research team will also connect with research and industrial stakeholders at NIIMBL, an institute in the Manufacturing USA network, to evaluate the use of their technology for the engineering of therapeutic cells and tissues.

Of paramount interest to tissue engineers is the precise differentiation of stem cells that are utilized as building blocks to construct organoids and microphysiological models for investigating developmental biology, pathology, and drug discovery. The project's approach to cell differentiation materials introduces Bio-Molecular-Array Patterns (Bio-MAPs), i.e., combined 3D gradients of cell signaling factors integrated within polymer matrices via ligand-mediated (non-covalent) adsorption. This concept will be demonstrated for the precision differentiation of multi-potent  intestinal stem cells. Accordingly, the project will adopt a biomolecular palette comprising collagen (COL), BMP-2, Wnt-3A, and Jagged-like ligands (which stimulate the Notch pathway), whose intersecting gradients in the intestinal crypt and villus are known to direct cell differentiation. Single-gradient Bio-MAPs (constant collagen plus gradients of laminin, BMP2, or Wnt3) will be developed to correlate Bio-MAP architecture (i.e., concentration and gradients of combined factors) to the adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of human ISC and subsequent lineages and to identify design rules and patterns that maintain stem-like phenotypes vs. direct differentiation towards secretory (mucus-producing) lineages or absorptive enterocytes. The project will develop complex-gradient Bio-MAPs (COL, BMP-2,Wnt-3, and Jagged-like ligands), where combinations of coherent or opposing signaling factors are utilized as backgrounds against tertiary presentation of Notch-binding ligands - herein, Jagged-like ligand (JLL) - to identify synergistic patterns that direct the differentiation towards quantitatively predictable phenotypic and genotypic outcomes. Complementary analytical and cytological techniques will be coupled to elucidate fundamental synergistic mechanisms of the select signaling factors and their geometric display.

"Epoxy resin is the most prevalent thermoset polymer matrix in the field of polymer composite materials due to its superior properties. It has also been used in versatile industrial applications such as adhesives, electronics, and coatings. Epoxy resin and its common hardeners (curing agents) are currently manufactured in a fossil fuel-based chemical process. In recent years, sustainable or ""green"" epoxy resin has emerged in scientific publications and in the composite market. However, there are limitations in current green epoxy technologies regarding mechanical performance, cost, and paired curing agent. This award supports development of an epoxy system and value-added composite products from a sustainable source: algae. The research has potential to remediate environmental concern in epoxy composite materials and impact significantly the epoxy-related industry, which is steadily growing these years with a projection of $38.2 billion global market in 2023. This research will enhance the competitiveness of North Carolina A&T State University, the largest public HBCU in the US, in the advanced material research sector. It will also strengthen and expand the education/training and research experiences of undergraduate and graduate students, especially underrepresented African American students, in green materials. The project will generate new information for K-12 level to promote STEM education and create public awareness about environment and sustainable systems. 

The overall objective of this research is to develop an economic, sustainable and environment-friendly bio-binder from algae through a thermochemical liquefaction process, then directly mix bio-binder with epoxy to completely replace conventional epoxy hardener and partially replace the epoxy resin. The collaborative research team will identify culture conditions of algae, reveal processing parameters of algae thermochemical liquefaction, and optimize manufacturing/curing conditions of the epoxy resin/bio-binder system. Particularly, the research will uncover the relationships among hydrothermal liquefaction parameters, contents of reactive functional groups in bio-binder, degree of cross-linking reaction in the curing process, and final mechanical properties of the cured products. The research will eventually generate a novel epoxy resin system for high-performance, sustainable, and economic epoxy-based nanocomposite materials. The research team will also perform molecular dynamic simulation to understand and predict mechanical properties of the epoxy resin/bio-binder system.

"Johnston Community College’s (JCC) Expanding a Multi-skilled STEM Technician Pipeline to Meet Industry Needs “Bio Blend 2.0” seeks to better prepare students to meet biotechnology company hiring needs and to improve employment outcomes for underserved populations, specifically focusing our recruitment of neurodiverse individuals on the autism spectrum. JCC is located one hour south of Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, where the demand for well-trained and diverse biopharma technicians is growing and exceeding the number of technicians currently produced from local and regional community colleges. Bio Blend 2.0 will further modify Applied Engineering and Bioprocess Technology curriculum to provide access to distributed control system software (DeltaV), work-based learning, and internship opportunities with a goal of enrolling 50 students in years two and three of this project. The project will broaden participation of students with autism at JCC by 150%, leading to greater participation of neurodiverse individuals in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) related programs. This three-year project will provide opportunities for DeltaV certification, Bio Blend certification, and Associates Degrees in Applied Engineering and Bioprocess Technology. Project results will include an increased number of trained technicians for local partners with national scalability for other colleges and industries.   

Bio Blend 2.0 seeks to accomplish three goals: 1) Modify Bio Blend curriculum, course progression, and resources based on stakeholder feedback and expand to all degree students across both the Applied Engineering and Bioprocess Technology programs; 2) Improve the Talent Pipeline to meet workforce and industry needs by developing a work-based learning experience and soft-skills training; and 3) Increase neurodiversity in the Applied Engineering and Bioprocess Technology programs to include more individuals from the autism spectrum. As part of the Bio Blend 2.0 project, DeltaV, the distributed control system used by many biotech companies, will be embedded into the curriculum across both programs. The project will also increase diversity and inclusion as it relates to the neurodivergent population. This is based on local industry feedback, unemployment rates for this population, and familiarity with a successful STEM program specifically for individuals with autism at other colleges. Faculty will receive training in Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to support diverse learners. JCC will also offer summer professional development opportunities for middle and high school educators and career counselors to strengthen the pipeline from public schools to postsecondary technician education. Industry feedback through advisory council meetings, classroom support, and on-going communication will improve student engagement and project outcomes. JCC’s Career Coach will facilitate learning communities for all students with specific focus for neurodiverse students on the autism spectrum. Bio Blend 2.0 will ultimately produce a more diverse and talented group of students from Applied Engineering and Biotechnology, ready to enter the workforce with hands-on applicable experience and certifications to fill the local industry need. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation’s economy.

"Man-made iron oxide nanoparticles have widespread importance for labeling cells and molecules both inside and outside the human body. Besides synthetic particles, many organisms also generate naturally occurring iron oxide nanoparticles, known as ferritin, to store and regulate iron within their bodies. Whether man-made or natural, these iron oxide nanoparticles have a magnetization that can be used as a tool for manipulation or sensing in biological environments. However, nanoparticles often aggregate in complex bio-environments, and the effect of aggregation on their collective magnetic properties is not well understood. The overall objective of this work is to explore the relationship between nanoparticle clustering and resultant magnetic properties. Findings from this work can be potentially used to engineer magnetism-based sensing tools for more accurately tracking iron nanoparticles in biological systems. Data from this  project can also advance other biomedical applications of iron oxide particles, such as their uses in magnetic hyperthermia for cancer therapy or as contrast agents for medical imaging. Besides advancing the field of bio-magnetism and nano-biotechnology, this research project will help train the next generation of scientists and engineers by providing research experience to students in state-of-the-art techniques for synthesis and characterization of nanoparticles, by enhancing infrastructure for research and education through the development of new techniques for magnetic characterization and by broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering activities. 
 
Iron-oxide nanoparticles have become crucial tools in biomedicine and bio-nanotechnology due to their magnetic behavior. These include synthetic magnetite nanoparticles (~5 to 10 nm in diameter), and naturally occurring ferrihydrite core (~ 5 to 8 nm) present in ferritin, the largest iron-storage protein in the human body. Determining the spatial localization and quantification of these iron-oxide nanoparticles in cells and tissues is critical for a number of applications in health. Thus far our ability to characterize the spatial distribution and quantity of iron oxide nanoparticles is limited to biochemical approaches like histochemical staining, which are largely qualitative. Magnetically sensitive detection offers an alternative, non-destructive, label free and quantitative means for characterization of iron-oxide nanoparticles. However, in biological systems, nanoparticles are often found in aggregates/clusters, which can impact their local and global magnetic properties and complicate interpretation of magnetic signals. The goal of this project is to understand how clustering of bio-inspired iron-oxide nanoparticles affect their magnetic properties across many length scales (nanometer to micrometer scale). Specifically, interactions between individual particles, as well as between larger clusters of particles, will be studied using a range of magnetically sensitive techniques. Biologically derived clusters of particles as well as artificially engineered aggregates will be used for the study. These include synthetic magnetite nanoparticles and naturally occurring ferrihydrite cores present in ferritin. In some cases, clusters will be nanofabricated using template guided assembly, so that geometric parameters of clusters such as size, shape, and interparticle distance can be varied systematically. Characterization of particle assemblies will be performed using techniques such as analytical electron microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, super-conducting quantum interference device magnetometry and magnetic resonance imaging. Results from this study will be used to develop advanced, magnetism-based metrology for localizing and quantifying aggregates of iron oxide nanoparticles in biological environments. An understanding of the effect of clustering on magnetic properties can enable quantitative histo-magnetic detection schemes for mapping iron deposits in tissue sections. The project activities will be accomplished by providing multidisciplinary and inter-institutional research experiences for graduate and undergraduate students and by establishing new research collaborations. The project will also include outreach efforts to broaden participation, by developing and offering hands-on workshops on engineering concepts to under-privileged middle school students at a local school.

"PART 1:   NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY
 
Finding optimal candidate and composition of engineered biomaterials is a challenging task with significant experimental cost and effort. To design effective, de novo biomaterials for cardiac repair, this CAREER award supported by the Biomaterials program aims to investigate a new biomaterials design strategy with data-driven approaches. The first objective is to create a large number of functionally relevant proteins with a computer algorithm, which are subject to systematic screening and selection. The second objective is to assess the selected pool of candidate proteins in a 3D model tissue including healthy and infarct conditions, where the model tissue is 3D bio-printed with another computer algorithm to minimize experimental trials and effort. With data-driven approaches, the PI seeks to attain 1) optimal, newly designed sequences of therapeutic proteins to accelerate the proliferation of cardiomyocytes and 2) optimal combinations of biomaterials and 3D bio-printing parameters to fabricate the model tissue with minimal experimental cost. In contrast to conventional approaches, the proposed data-driven approaches are adaptive to altered experimental conditions to reach the optimal target of biomaterial properties with enhanced experimental efficiency. The outcome of this CAREER award can potentially provide a novel platform of engineering therapeutic proteins and fabricating a model tissue with optimal cost and effort. Outreach activities and educational curricula are proposed to engage a range of students from middle school to undergraduate students to promote the exposure of biomaterials research to those students in highly agricultural and petrochemical engineering-oriented industrial settings. 
 
PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY
 

This CAREER award aims to engineer an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein to accelerate the proliferation of cardiomyocytes. Once over 4 million functionally relevant chimeras are created by a computer algorithm, screening and selection of those chimeras are experimentally expensive. Thus, the new approach proposed in the CAREER award is to utilize publicly available data to build machine learning models to screen and select those chimeras, which will be built upon a Gaussian Process to derive a posterior from a prior and observations. To avoid the overfitting problem of machine learning with the relatively smaller number of publicly available data, an additional machine learning model will be built with 1) protein folding metrics and 2) intracellular protein-based assay. To assess the performance of designer ECM proteins, an in vitro model of infarct (border zone) will be fabricated with 3D bio-printing. To recapitulate complex features of the border zone with minimal numbers of trials of 3D bio-printing, Bayesian Optimization will be applied to balance the exploration of the overall search space and the exploitation of the local search space to effectively achieve the optimal 3D bio-printing and biomaterial parameters. To unambiguously identify the proliferation of cardiomyocytes in the model border zone, genetically labeled adult cardiomyocytes will be 3D bio-printed in the model border zone to assess the increase of cardiomyocyte proliferation. This CAREER award also seeks to support STEM education in the areas of biomaterials research. The outreach program targets specifically local secondary school and undergraduate students to attract them into future workforce in biomaterials areas with priorities to female and underrepresented groups in STEM education.

"PART 1:   NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY 

Nano-materials are extremely small sized materials. Nano-materials become biomaterials when they directly or indirectly interact with living things, and also when they are used as biosensors, bioimaging or therapeutic agents. Understanding the interactions occurring at the interface of such nano-materials and biological molecules is very important for several potential applicatons. The current project will develop novel, two-dimensional (2D) nano-materials and examine their physical and chemical interactions with biomolecules. This will be accomplished by coupling computational simulations and experimental investigations. The expected outcome is that novel nano-platforms will be developed, and they will have capability to be explored for numerous promising applications in industry. Successful completion of this project will offer many fascinating physicochemical properties that will generate exciting opportunities for future two-dimensional nanomaterials-based biosensing, bioimaging, and therapeutic applications. The project will provide excellent research and education opportunities for underrepresented minority undergraduate and graduate students from Clark Atlanta University and Jackson State University. The current project will increase the skilled workforce in the important fields of computation and emerging novel material design, with an emphasis on enhancing and promoting diversity from underrepresented groups.

PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY

The project will provide a better understanding of the nano-bio interface at the cellular and molecular levels, which is extremely important to guide the rational design of 2D material for biomedical devices. The proposed research will address essential new questions on how the heterogeneous nature of the biological system influences the dynamics of nano-bio interactions. The research and educational activities of this project include: (i) Development, computational exploration, and characterization of chemically functionalized 2D materials of graphene oxide and phosphorene; (ii) Elucidation of the multivalent interactions at nano-bio interfaces between 2D materials with DNA/RNA, proteins, and peptides; (iii) Understanding how corona formation on 2D nano-material changes the biological fate, using cell viability and cellular uptake experiment; (iv) Performing computational modeling to understand the interactions of 2D materials with biomolecules; and (v) Engaging minority students in advanced research on emerging nano-bio technologies. The current project will provide opportunities for underrepresented minority participants to become next generation materials scientists through innovative research and education in emerging 2D material-based biotechnology research areas. The successful execution of this project may lead to the development of safe nano-materials for bio-nano technologies.

"Tephritid fruit fly Multidisciplinary Australian Research Collaboration for Biosecurity (T-MARC-BIO), a Track I IRES project at Eastern Mennonite University (EMU), will engage 18 undergraduate students from the state of Virginia to gain multidisciplinary research experience in Australia that will advance basic science and address internationally significant challenges in ensuring biosecurity and a robust global food supply chain. Students will be recruited from EMU and neighboring institutions to conduct research on fruit flies (Tephritidae), which are among the most damaging horticultural insect pests worldwide, constituting pest management issues, trade barriers, and invasion threats for Australia, the U.S., and throughout the tropics and subtropics. The results of this research will have an impact on integrated pest management, which is a critical component of sustainable agro-ecological systems in the U.S. and worldwide. With good cause, the public is becoming increasingly concerned about the health and environmental impacts of synthetic pesticides, and their use is becoming highly restricted. The T-MARC-BIO program will add to the toolkit of effective, long-term strategies for both pest control and monitoring of invasive species, while minimizing the impacts of pesticides on human and environmental health. American students will gain valuable research experience through conducting projects in the multidisciplinary settings in Australia, as well as the life-changing learning, interpersonal skills, empathy, and global awareness that come from living and working in a foreign country. T-MARC-BIO will contribute to developing a diverse, globally engaged scientific workforce pipeline by recruiting highly qualified female, low-income, and minority students, who are underrepresented in the sciences.

Through T-MARC-BIO, students will (1) participate in a semester-long pre-travel research preparation and cross-cultural program, (2) conduct rigorous individual research projects on tephritid fruit flies during a seven-week period in Australia, (3) immerse themselves in Australian culture as they participate in research fields with global interest and impact, and (4) communicate their research through scientific journals and presentations, and in the local community. The U.S. and Australia make significant research investments to both enhance control of existing pest fly populations and improve interdiction of invasive flies entering the respective countries. The results of T-MARC-BIO student-assisted research will advance knowledge in three areas: tephritid fruit fly physiology and behavior, organic analysis and synthesis of fruit fly lures, and field ecology and management techniques. Collectively, these results will address gaps in understanding of how fruit flies metabolize secondary plant compounds, what they smell and what attracts them, how they move in the environment, and how to develop more effective control techniques, such as attractant fruit fly lures. Evaluation findings about the T-MARC-BIO project will be applicable to small (two- and four-year) colleges, their administrators, and STEM faculty. T-MARC-BIO students will share the benefits of enriched, multidisciplinary academic research training and participating in publishable research that advances STEM fields, as well as basic and applied science.

"The 11th International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation (IWBDA) 2019 takes place in Cambridge UK July 8th to July 12th and will bring together researchers from electronic design automation (the practice of using computer software to build complex electronics) and synthetic biology (the forward design of novel biological systems using engineering principles). The goal of IWBDA is to make biology more easily, robustly, reliably, and predictably engineered and therefore, tackle challenges in biology and medicine, leading to advances in disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention. This award provides travel assistance for ten undergraduate and graduate students to attend this workshop to present research, participate in a computer programming competition, and network with a large community of industrial and academic researchers. These participants will go on to form the foundation of the field in the future.
	
Specifically these students will join a wide variety of researchers (120+) from electronic design automation and synthetic biology in a unique context which does not exist elsewhere. They will have access to between twelve and fifteen technical talks, two invited lectures, ten to twenty posters, multiple group discussion sessions, and a featured student programming competition (BDAthlon). This award covers the registration for the workshop as well as partial support for travel and housing.

"The ability to record events (“memory”) is a crucial part of many complex systems. Recording events allows these systems to modify their behavior based on previous interactions, report on their history, or communicate local information to a global community. Biological systems will benefit greatly from the creation of memory elements. Biological memories in bacterial or mammalian cells could be used to monitor a person’s microbiome, develop smart materials that respond to the environment, or create specialized sensors that react to biotoxins. Biological memories in living cells themselves require a controlled environment. This environment not only ensures their long-term survival and viability but also allows for the controlled reading and writing of the memory. Reading and writing will ultimately be how these systems are “programmed” and how the data they collect can be acted upon. This project creates novel bio-memories using devices that move small amounts of liquids (microfluidics). Microfluidics are used to test in parallel many biological-memory configurations to determine which are the best at testing specific environmental signals (e.g. toxins, metals, hormones). The best of these memories are then integrated with low-cost, embedded electronics that can read their outputs as well as control the microfluidic environments housing the memories and allowing external signals to “write” information in the memories. Biological memories, microfluidics, and electronics together form what is called “Hybrid Bio-Electronic Microfluidic Memory Arrays”. These devices will explore numerous interdisciplinary challenges and create opportunities for exploring applications at the boundaries of computer science, synthetic biology, and materials science.  To maximize this project’s impact, all of the research including the microfluidic and electronics designs and software will be made open source. All genetic memory elements will be provided to the scientific community. More than 48 undergraduate students will be mentored during the project period via NSF sponsored programs and summer research programs at Boston University. 

This project has a three-phase structure, where in the first phase biological memories are developed with the aid of a high-throughput, electronically augmented microfluidic screening platform. Recombinase enzymatic reactions on DNA will act as the irreversible memories while epigenetic, chromatin modifications will act as the reversible mechanism. This phase will involve the creation of 1000’s of potential memory elements. In the second phase, the top candidates from the first phase are combined in a massively parallel, highly integrated microfluidics platform to develop the eventual deployed microfluidic as well as establishing the operating and control conditions needed for the memories. Finally, in phase three, a small-scale deployment environment is created to observe and tune the performance of the newly created Hybrid Bio-Electronic Microfluidic Memory Arrays in an aquatic deployment scenario meant to replicate real-world bio-sensing applications for heavy metals and other environmental signals. These phases explicitly address three bio-memory challenges (create, control, and deploy) using state-of-the-art biological reversible and irreversible memories, droplet microfluidics, and customized embedded semiconductor-based electronics.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a 3D printed bio-tissue platform that allows for customized, patient-specific devices for craniofacial reconstruction and augmentation.  Current reconstructive support devices are not anatomically and functionally patient-specific, do not allow for precise fit, require time-consuming and often multiple surgeries, have sub-optimal tissue ingrowth, and may migrate, causing tissue erosion. Permanent cosmetic implants often need to be ex-planted due to systemic health concerns and adverse immune reactions to the implants. Furthermore, traditional manufacturing is unable to address the needs of traumatic and rare disorder populations due to the prohibitive cost of infrastructure and operational expenditures involved in customizing patient-specific devices. The proposed 3D printed bio-tissue platform allows for customized anatomic and functionally patient-specific devices that may reduce operative time, anesthetic risk, perioperative risk, and patient recovery times. In addition, the proposed technology may provide superior patient outcomes with considerable reduction in costs, surgical time, and hospital stays, which may be a benefit to patients, hospitals, and health insurers.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a 3D bio-tissue platform for the craniofacial reconstruction and augmentation industry with customized, patient-specific devices (including ear, nose scaffolds and spreader grafts).  The proposed 3D printed resorbable bio-tissue technology uses an integrated design and manufacturing process that allows the devices to transition to native tissue over time, reducing the risk of long-term infections and offering safe, reproducible, and predictable aesthetic outcomes.  Multiscale computational simulation software and proprietary toolsare utilized to design structurally-sound implants used as scaffolds in head and neck reconstructive surgery. The safety and efficacy of the 3D printed resorbable bio-tissue technology have been proven with airway support devices implanted in 25 patients under FDA expanded access. The intent of this project is to explore a wider application of technologies in the craniofacial reconstruction and augmentation industry, specifically for rhinoplasty and ear and nose reconstruction surgery.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a technology that can convert yard trimmings disposed as municipal solid waste (MSW; 35 million tons produced annually in the US), into an environmentally benign anti-icer through anaerobic digestion. The proposed anti-icer is a potent alternative to traditional deicers, as it may be applied to road surfaces before a snow storm hits the targeted area, eliminating the need for deicer operations to be performed during the storm. One of the most commonly-used anti-icers is sodium chloride (NaCl, salt brine). While salt brine typically has been used as an anti-icer on roadways and in airports, the use of the salt brine corrodes vehicles, bridges, and asphalt and is known to damage the surrounding environment. It is also known that salt brine has a high transport rate in the surrounding environments and low hold-over time.  Organic alternatives to the salt brine in the market are calcium-magnesium acetate (CMA) and potassium acetate. However, these products cost about a $700-$1,000 per ton.  Commercial potential of the proposed anti-icer will be evaluated as a cost-effective and environmentally benign alternative to its competitors. 

This I-Corps project is based on the development of an anti-icer road surface treatment.  It is produced from simultaneous use of anaerobic digestion and accelerated bioleaching processes to form a liquid organic anti-icer from digestion of grass or any high protein plant substrates (green waste) co-digested with molasses or any other potassium rich organic material. The two simultaneous processes take place inside an anaerobic digester filled with green waste and molasses and water at optimum proportions and equipped with a recirculation system. In the process of anaerobic digestion, insoluble organic compounds are hydrolyzed and broken into simpler soluble organic compounds by the naturally occurring anaerobic bacteria present in the grass. During this process, acetate is produced, and through a reaction with potassium present in molasses, it forms potassium acetate, which may be used as liquid organic anti-icer. Preliminary results have shown that the proposed anti-icer may be effective at temperatures as low as 15˚F.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve, accelerate, and alleviate costs of protein engineering across diverse industries including industrial biocatalysts, biomanufacturing, food technology, and therapeutics. Today, late-stage protein engineering represents a major time, labor, and financial bottleneck. Since real-world translation is the focus of late-stage development, assays are more reflective of their end-use application and therefore necessarily require more time, labor, and capital. This precludes many variants from being screened at this stage. Failure at these late stages of development is costly, and often results from a change in environmental parameters from test conditions in early high throughput screens. Accurate prediction of protein variants based on minimal data but with high likelihood of function under end-use conditions is a critical unmet need.

The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging a machine learning model, trained on raw protein sequences, mutagenesis datasets and natural sequence- function pairs, to predict highly functional variants of a protein of interest (POI) without sequence-function datasets specific to the selected POI and application. Such an approach, known as zero-shot learning, has not been applied to protein engineering to date. To achieve this, a large-scale language model will be trained with almost 5 billion curated unlabeled protein sequences from public and private databases and a collection of mutagenesis datasets. This general knowledge model can then be fused with an application-specific top model derived from natural sequences (distinct from the POI) paired with parameters of their natural environments. This training is hypothesized to imbue the model with a notion of which sequence features improve protein function in a general sense, and under particular environmental conditions (e.g., high temperature, high salinity, etc.). To demonstrate the feasibility and utility of this approach, the model will be used in virtual directed evolution experiments to optimize two therapeutically relevant enzymes, optimized for function in non-native environments, and assessed for this function in vitro.

"The natural patterns of human movement depend on interactions between the nervous system, muscles and skeleton. A problem with any of these elements--perhaps due to medical conditions, illnesses or injuries--can lead to movement limitations. In such cases, people may follow physical therapy procedures to recover the loss or change in movement ability. Currently, robots and exoskeletons are used in physical therapy to help individuals return to their prior level of functioning and to assist them to do activities-of-daily living (ADL). However, these robots and exoskeletons do not align with the human anatomical joints, which can result in discomfort or injury to the user and affect the success of the rehabilitation therapy. In this research project, human joint motions during ADL will be studied, recorded, and analyzed using video motion capture data and musculoskeletal computer simulations. The analyzed human motion patterns will be used to inspire the design of bio-exoskeletons that are capable of mimicking the complex 3D motions involved in human movement. The bio-inspired exoskeletons developed will then be compared to the traditional exoskeletons designed to mimic a human joint. The outcome of the comparison study will help to advance the knowledge in the design and utilization of bio-exoskeletons for the improved synergy between the human-exoskeleton systems in medical, industrial, and military applications. To inspire the new generation and STEM education, findings will also be shared with the public via publication, exhibitions at the Exploration Place science museum in Wichita, and university sponsored summer camps for K-12 students. Additionally, at the university level, the team will integrate research findings from the proposed work into the undergraduate and graduate courses to motivate students to perform systematic research and to reduce conceptual learning barriers of assistive devices through the implementation of Project-Based-Learning (PBL) approaches in the classroom.

The objective of this project is to investigate a correlation model between parameters involved in human joint movements in the fitting and alignment of exoskeletons to a human body for an effective human-exoskeleton cooperation.  Traditionally, exoskeletons are designed to align with the human joint axes of motion by assigning each human joint with an equivalent exoskeleton joint (e.g. a hinge joint for the elbow) that assumes that the location of the axis can be accurately known, and that such a fixed axis exists for the range of motion of the joint or set of joints.  Unfortunately, this is not always the case. The compound motion of joints makes their alignment with an exoskeleton more difficult and misalignment can create large stresses on the attached systems and underlying human anatomy, giving rise to the need for novel exoskeleton design strategies that permit the complex 3D motions independent of anatomical measures and landmarks.  To address this need, the Research Plan is organized under four tasks.  The FIRST Task is to collect joint movement parameters involved in human joint movements (hand and arm) while performing desired limb trajectories.  Conventional motion capture systems (MoCap) will be combined with a mobile MoCap system that uses sensors to obtain inertial measurements that are communicated wirelessly to a mobile data logger, e.g., a smartphone.  The data base assembled will provide 1) fundamental knowledge on the underlying human limb motion and 2) techniques to identify and select functional limb motion for a desired task. The SECOND Task is to analyze, model, and simulate the parameters involved in human joint movements using a musculoskeletal software application.  The parameters of an arm, wrist, and hand musculoskeletal model will be scaled using the OpenSim Scale Model tool to best fit the experimentally measured subject mass and marker positions.  The simulations provide 1) muscle force interaction and joint reaction forces during the execution of the desired motions and 2) a tool for the identification of sources for misalignment and fitting challenges. The THIRD Task is to investigate bio-inspired exoskeletons based on the related human joint parameters related to the desired trajectory of the human limb.  This task will provide: 1) geometrical and algebraic insight\representation of the human limb workspace based on the motion captured data and 2) an atlas of mechanism topologies and their workspaces to closely approximate the geometrical pattern of the human limb workspace. The FOURTH Task is to prototypes and investigate the correlation between parameters and exoskeleton fitting and alignments.  A bio-inspired prototype will be fabricated using an additive manufacturing process followed by integration of electronic components for real-time control and feedback.  The bio-inspired exoskeletons will be compared to a 3 DOF joint-based exoskeleton previously developed by the investigators.  The exoskeletons will be mounted on a wheelchair and be used in human subject testing on persons with reduced upper limb mobility, and the ADL performed will provide datasets such as trajectory path, EMG signals, FMG readings, and effectiveness and comparative analysis using the two different exoskeleton mechanisms. Data collected will be used to 1) develop a correlation model for the two exoskeletons independently and 2) to assess the intervention of each of the exoskeleton designs (the task-based approach based on the bioinspired method and joint-to-joint alignment-based design approaches).

"The research supported by this award will investigate the effects of socio-cultural context on the governance of human bio-material donation and sale. Over the past few decades, medical science has increased the potential uses of human bio-materials. However, as innovation has increased, so have questions about costs, outcomes, and ethics. In response, a variety of different regulatory policies have been adopted globally. This variation across countries provides an excellent opportunity for comparative research to see to what degree policy differences produce different outcomes for donors, recipients, and other stakeholders. In this project, researchers will focus on one area of bio-material donation -- compensated donation of human eggs -- in two different cultural contexts. Results from this research will benefit policy makers, medical professionals, and patient and provider advocates. The project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students. 

The research will be carried out by Dr. Diane Tober, a medical anthropologist from the University of California, San Francisco, in collaboration with researchers from the Spanish University of Distance Education and from Complutense University, both in Madrid, Spain. These research sites were chosen because the United States and Spain are the two primary locations for donor egg fertility treatment, but their bio-material markets operate within dramatically different cultural and regulatory environments. The U.S. has comparatively few regulations limiting donor selection, compensation, and identification, while Spain is highly regulated, limits donor compensation, and requires donor anonymity. The researchers will collect data through ethnographic observation in two or more clinics in each country; interviews with medical professionals in the fertility industry and other key informants; and interviews and surveys of women in each country who provide eggs for pay, including both experienced and first-time donors. The quantitative data will be analyzed with standard statistical methods; the qualitative ethnographic data will be examined using computer-assisted qualitative data analytical techniques and through narrative analysis. Results, presented in professional publications and at conferences, will help social scientists understand how underlying cultural logics inform the crafting and regulation of medical markets and the commodification of human bio-materials. Results will also be made available through policy briefs and public fora to assist policy makers who need to understand how regulatory differences affect outcomes, as well as patients and donors who participate in bio-material markets.

"The world is facing a wide range of grand challenges, such as the rapid growth in energy demand and more frequent extreme weather and climate conditions. By learning from Nature, Biomimicry or bio-inspired engineering innovation has great potential to address such human challenges. The practice of biomimicry requires a diverse group of scientists and engineers equipped with technical knowledge of biomimicry and interdisciplinary, cross-cultural research experience. To meet this need, the BIOFLOW IRES Track-1 site delivers international research experience to US students, operated by Cleveland State University (CSU) and University of Akron (UA) through a long-time partnership with the Biofluid & Biomimic Research Center (BBRC) at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), South Korea. As a Korean government-funded National Creative Research Center, BBRC has excelled at advancing the knowledge of bio-fluid flow physics in Nature and developing bio-inspired engineering solutions. The BIOFLOW IRES project leverages the world-class resources of bio-flow and biomimicry expertise, research facilities, and equipment for a diverse group of 18 US students to conduct creative bio-inspired research, gain solid research and communication skills, and build a professional network. This group of students is well-prepared to embark on their careers as future leading researchers, scientists, and ambassadors for biomimicry research and innovative design. The collaborative IRES project opens up new interdisciplinary research collaboration that bridge biology and engineering, strengthens international research partnerships, and contributes to enhancing the competitiveness of the US workforce in the global economy. 


The BIOFLOW IRES project aims to provide future scientists and engineers with a global, cross-cultural perspective, and professional growth opportunities through cutting-edge international research training, structured mentoring, and networking opportunities. Research on bio-fluid flows and biomimicry focuses on two complementary research themes addressing the Grand challenges: enhanced energy efficiency and wind resilience of the built environment. The IRES participants perform wind-tunnel tests to evaluate the effectiveness of a seal-whisker-inspired turbine blade for vertical axis wind turbines, explore how the shapes of plant leaves affect energy exchange, and create tree-like flow-control devices to suppress rooftop vortices in high winds. Research discovers new knowledge of working principles of bio-fluid flow phenomena in biology and catalyzes original engineering innovations to achieve enhanced energy efficiency and wind resilience. IRES students gain authentic research training in advanced thermal/flow measurements, critical thinking, and career-building skills benefiting from extraordinary resources at US labs of CSU/UA and the Koerean host lab BBRC. Along with innovative research, the IRES students participate in social and cultural exchange activities to enhance student-faculty, student-mentor, and student-student connection, starting a professional network for future collaboration and career development, an impact beyond the IRES program.

"This award shall provide partial support for participants to a two-week q-bio Summer school in July 15-29, 2019 at Rice University. The abbreviation ""q-bio"" is derived from Quantitative Biology and it refers to combined biological and mathematical methods of obtaining insights into processes that underlie evolution and functioning of biological cells in health and disease. One such example is response of individual cells to stimuli such as viruses: Each cell responds in different (""noisy"") way, but their interaction elicits coordinated immune response. Predicting this response requires advanced simulations and theory of chemical reactions. The purpose of this school activity is to encourage early career scientists to pursue quantitative systems biology and concurrently provide a forum for professional networking and the exchange of new results and ideas. The participants will be involved in research projects, some of which lead to scientific progress and publications. The Program Committee, including the members of Organizing Committee and ranking faculty, selects applicants for admission and decides about financial aid. Diversity of participants is strongly promoted.

The summer school activities include two tracks: Cancer Dynamics and Evolution and Stochastic Cell Regulation. The topics shall cover stochasticity and cell-to-cell variability in the measurement and modeling of biochemical systems. Emphasis will be given to the effects that small numbers of important molecules (i.e. genes, RNA, and protein) have on the dynamics of living cells. The lectures will review experimental manifestations of stochastic effects in molecular biology, as can be measured using single-cell and single-molecule techniques. The lectures will discuss the most recent analytical and numerical methods that are used to model these systems and show how these methods can improve interpretation of experimental data. The lecture will discuss how different cellular mechanisms control and/or exploit randomness in order to survive in uncertain environments. Lectures will cover topics spanning many time- and length-scales, from the fundamental issues of cell proliferation and mutation dynamics, to molecular events affecting specific pathways in cells, to population genetics effects. This section of the summer school will include a number of instructor-suggested group projects, in which students will apply various numerical techniques to formulate, identify and solve stochastic models of cancer evolution. Students will then apply these tools to model experimental and clinical data. More information can be found at the qbSS website http://q-bio.org/wp/qbss/.

"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will advance scientific knowledge of the flow physics of rooftop vortices from hurricane-type strong winds on low-rise buildings and develop bio-inspired flow control strategies to attenuate the damaging effects of roof suctions on building resilience. Dramatic damage repeatedly occurs on low-rise building roofs during windstorms, as observed in recent hurricanes Matthew (2016), Maria (2017), and Michael (2018). Building roof failure often starts at the windward roof edges and corners, where extreme peak suctions are induced by flow separation and unsteady vortices. Improved understanding of vortex dynamics governing the worst roof suction and smart flow control strategies by learning from nature will contribute towards more accurate wind load prediction, enhanced wind design provisions, and reduction of wind-induced damage and economic and life losses, and thus advance post-windstorm national welfare and prosperity. The bio-inspiration approach will not only produce cost-effective, high-performance mitigation strategies for low-rise buildings, but will also motivate new thinking in broader engineering fields. This research will use the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Wall of Wind (WOW) facility at Florida International University (FIU). Experimental datasets will be archived in the NHERI Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org) and be made publicly available for validation of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. To strengthen the persistence of engineering students, first-year undergraduate students will be engaged in a new learning community by integrating scientific questions into team-based, early research experiences, as well as weekly open workshops and invited seminars. The learning community program will improve the STEM infrastructure, broaden underrepresented groups’ participation in engineering, and build a pipeline for the engineering workforce.  This project will support the investigator's long-term career vision focused on fundamental research on wind-structure interaction and bio-inspired flow control to increase the wind resilience of civil infrastructure that contributes to community resilience and sustainability. This award contributes to the National Science Foundation's role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). 

The specific research objectives are the following: (1) quantify three-dimensional, transient rooftop vortices from hurricane-type high winds of high Reynolds numbers, (2) correlate the unsteady vortices with roof peak pressures, and (3) utilize bio-inspiration as an innovation tool to create cost-effective wind mitigation devices, ultimately enhancing the wind resiliency of low-rise buildings. A series of well-controlled wind tunnel experiments with unsteady flow and pressure over a scaled low-rise building model will be conducted at Cleveland State University and the FIU WOW facility. Systematic measurements of the unsteady three-dimensional vortical flow at high Reynolds numbers will also be beneficial to the broader fluid mechanics community to advance understanding, modeling, and control of a wide class of vortex flow phenomena. The research will result in (1) vortex flow mechanisms governing the peak roof suctions at high Reynolds numbers, and (2) bio-inspired, cost-effective mitigation strategies (porous fractal parapets) to manipulate vortex formation, applicable to new and retrofit of existing low-rise buildings.

"This Future EcoManufacturing research grant will enable a future intelligent, scalable, and democratized manufacturing paradigm that allows for distributed printing of low-cost, biodegradable, and recyclable electronic devices using locally identifiable resources, such as bio-based materials derived from plants.  These electronic devices are critical components in the rapidly evolving Internet of Things (IoT).  The distributed manufacturing can lower overall device costs (by saving transportation costs) and make the supply chain more resilient during disruptions (e.g., during a pandemic). This project will demonstrate as a prototype the distributed printing of a lithium-ion battery (LIB) - powered chemical sensors using plant-derived inks. The printed devices will be used for monitoring growth conditions of hydronic plants that are used to derive the inks.  The same platform can be used to print many other sophisticated, biodegradable/recyclable electronic devices using bio-based materials through customization and active learning. Through partnership with community colleges, Manufacturing USA Institutes, and manufacturing incubators, the project aims to educate, train, engage, and excite diverse student audiences and the public on the future sustainable manufacturing through several new, tailored initiatives, such as a cross-institutional certificate program, printable electronics hackathon and DIY initiative, and citizen science competition. 

The goal of the project is to enable a manufacturing supply chain from precision agriculture/hydroponics to advanced biodegradable and recyclable electronics. The project will lead to major science advances in three domains: precision growth of plants, manufacturing of tailored bio-based inks, and sustainable production of printable electronics.  As a convergent research program, the project will further lead to value-added transferrable and scalable scientific advancements, including novel artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms for manufacturing, a framework for designing sustainable and systematically optimized manufacturing processes, and techniques for incorporating heterogeneous data into manufacturing data systems while automatically refining the models.  Learned models will correlate plant phenotypes and growth conditions with cellulose and lignin extraction, connect ink formulation with desired ink properties, and associate printing parameters with electronic device performance and quality.  The project will lead to an open-source biomaterials-based electronics manufacturing data infrastructure (BEMDI) that fosters innovation through building a community of innovators, educators, and industry partners interested in manufacturing bio-based printable electronics.  This Future Manufacturing research is supported by the Divisions of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI), Biological Sciences (BIO), Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Activities (EFMA), Materials Research (DMR), Electrical Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS), Engineering Education and Centers (EEC), and Mathematical Sciences (DMS).

"This project was awarded through the “NSF-DFG Lead Agency Activity in Electrosynthesis and Electrocatalysis (NSF-DFG EChem)"" opportunity, a collaborative solicitation that involves the National Science Foundation and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG). This is a collaborative project between researchers at Michigan State University and Technische Universität Braunschweig (TUB) in Germany. Electrobiofuels are fuels that couple the energy from two renewable sources: biomass and electricity from renewables such as from wind turbines and solar photovoltaics. By cycling the renewable carbon in the 1.3 billion tons/year of plant biomass that will become available in the United States, electrobiofuels could displace fossil carbon-based fuels and the resulting greenhouse gas addition to the atmosphere. Key needs are carbon-, hydrogen- and energy-efficient technologies to convert renewable plant matter into liquid transportation fuels. Carbon efficiency is especially critical; in the U.S., there is only enough carbon in plant biomass to displace about one-half of the 2019 level of petroleum usage, even assuming high harvest yields, perfect conversion, and no net growth in fuel demand. This project addresses a path to renewable hydro¬carbons fuels and chemicals via biomass fast pyro¬lysis, electro¬catalytic hydro¬genation (ECH) in decen¬tral¬ized facilities, and further upgrading at petro¬leum refineries. Much is known about fast pyrolysis and upgrading of pyrolysis bio-oils via thermal hydrogenation, but the use of ECH to partially upgrade and stabilize bio-oil is largely unprecedent¬ed. This project will map the mechanisms of ECH and the factors that limit its performance and to improve accuracy and decrease the uncertainties in ECH reaction and process models. Through MSU’s College of Engineering Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Summer Programs, high school students will be hosted for engineering science interactive experiences.  The PIs will also run an after-school program with the Boys and Girls Club of Lansing, Michigan, to introduce middle school students to electrochemistry.  These programs will address the need for biofuels to reduce climate change and discuss with the student researchers the basic principles of electrochemical engineering.  Students will also be introduced to computational chemistry software that can be used for molecular modeling.  Lesson plans, presentations, and laboratory methods developed as part of the collaboration will be shared amongst the US and German investigators.  These Broader Impact activities will positively engage middle and high school students in the US and Germany by demonstrating organic chemical electrosynthesis, a topic not typically seen in high school curriculums.      

The focus of this German-US collaboration is to study electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of fast pyrolysis bio-oils as a path to chemical and hydrocarbon fuel precursors.  Fast pyrolysis uses heat without oxygen to convert biomass into liquid bio-oil, solid biochar, and combustible gases. However, bio-oil’s corrosiveness and reactive instability limit its use in conventional fuel and chemical processes. ECH saturates carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double bonds, as well as the delocalized pi systems of aromatic compounds, in aqueous media at temperatures and pressures much milder than those used in hydroprocessing. Thus, reduction via ECH can stabilize the bio-oil, making it compatible with conventional manufacturing infrastructure.  Core activities of the project include electrocatalytic organic transformations, catalyst evaluation by in operando techniques, quantum chemical modeling, reaction engineering and reactor design leading to fundamental knowledge supporting system optimization and scale-up. As part of the research collaboration, US graduate students will conduct in operando measurements in Germany, while German graduate students will perform quantum chemical modeling in the US. With further development, ECH may yield “finished” hydrocarbon fuels, enabling rural production of electrobiofuels.  Data from experiments and modeling will be used to update technoeconomic and life cycle analyses, assessing cost feasibility and the potential for “carbon negative” production of liquid fuels.  These analyses are needed to de-risk the eventual commercialization of fast pyrolysis and ECH as steps in production of renewable liquid fuels. Such operations are needed to reduce the deleterious effects of climate change while still benefitting from the installed hydrocarbon fuel distribution infrastructure.

"This research project involves studying a new class of materials that can significantly improve the performance of currently available devices used in the energy, environmental, and biotech sectors of the economy. In recent decades, population growth, higher life expectancy and rapid industrialization have increased needs for water, energy, food, sanitation, and health care. For instance, the United States National Intelligence Council (USNIC) estimates that by 2030, societal demand in these areas will increase by 40-50%. Many of these increased demands can be addressed by advanced sensors, catalysts, membranes, and biomaterials that can, for instance, make it easier to remove chemical pollutants from water, detect and destroy pathogens, and carry out faster chemical and biological tests with improved precision and lower cost. Nanomaterials show great potential for such game-changing applications, but their use in actual devices has been rare, since they can easily escape into the surroundings posing high risk of material loss and environmental toxicity. This research project addresses this dilemma with a novel materials architecture that combines the power and efficiency of nanomaterials with the safety, durability and reusability of conventional solids. 

The specific goal of the project is to investigate bioinspired three-dimensional surfaces that combine the functional advantages of nanomaterials with the structural advantages of conventional solids. Such materials can provide a novel multifunctional platform for custom-tailored catalysts, antimicrobial agents, sensors and/or bio-scaffolds. The design concept is to enrich the surface of porous solid substrates with carpet-like arrays of carbon nanotubes (CNT) that can be further customized with nanoscale catalysts, sensors and biomolecules for tailoring their interaction with surrounding fluids. This architecture mimics natural biological materials such as microvilli and capillaries, where the larger membrane supports progressively smaller specialized attachments. This approach can offer exceptionally high levels of solid-fluid interaction in very compact space. Moreover, different regions of the same substrate can concurrently provide multiple simultaneous benefits in a single filter, reactor, or bio-engineering platform. Currently available devices do not use this architecture, due to the complexities of bonding dissimilar components that create multiple unknown interfaces. This project addresses these complex issues, and explores the possibility of synthesizing such materials for solid-fluid interactions involving catalysis, signal detection and cell scaffolding through the following research tasks: (1) investigation of nano-carpets on porous solids, and their affinity for different fluids; (2) study of chemical & catalytic reactions at hierarchical surfaces; and (3) understanding biological interaction of nano-carpets with peptides and living cells. In parallel with the research, education and outreach components are being developed for undergraduates, science teachers, community leaders as well as governmental policy personnel.","Orono","University of Maine","47.041","5325","Catalysis","2022000","sharmila.mukhopadhyay@maine.edu","Sharmila","Mukhopadhyay","03/03/2020","01/01/2020","12/31/2020","EAGER: Novel Bio-inspired 3D Materials for Surface-Active Devices","BIO"

"All NSF funded grants have the potential to not only advance scientific knowledge but also contribute to the achievement of socially relevant outcomes.  Socially relevant scientific outcomes are referred to as Broader Impacts. Education, training, collaboration, broadening participation and raising awareness of the role that science plays in the quality of everyday life are broader impacts that promote science literacy in society.  The National Science Foundation places great importance on the communication of science and its potential to benefit society. While broader impacts are of great importance, achieving them at scale requires addressing challenges in planning and implementing activities that include: 1) finding and sharing resources (funding, infrastructure and personnel); 2) locating and collating information that is diverse, widespread and presented in a variety of ways; 3) addressing the lack of technical expertise and infrastructure for creating websites, videos, and integrating applications such as social media, survey tools and analytic tools; 4) disseminating information and interacting with large, distributed groups; 5) meeting recruitment initiative goals to broaden participation and building collaborations in unfamiliar communities; and 6) measuring success and promoting successful projects. The primary objective of this workshop is to address these issues by exploring the creation of an integrated Gateway for Education, Training, Broader Impacts and Outreach for EPSCoR jurisdictions that would provide infrastructure for researchers, educators, students, project managers, and the general public to access, create, and share information about broader impact activities and resources. 

Strategies for realizing the Broader Impacts (BI) of scientific research include using cyberinfrastructure to empower knowledge dissemination, activating effective jurisdictional and regional collaborations that advance scientific research, broadening participation in science, technology and engineering and mathematics (STEM), expanding the scientific literacy of all citizens, and disseminating the importance of STEM research and education. The primary objective of this workshop is to assess the state of the art in existing resources to promote BI, and explore creating an integrated Gateway for Education, Training, Broader Impacts and Outreach for EPSCoR jurisdictions that would provide infrastructure for researchers, educators, students, project managers, and the general public to access, create, and share information about broader impact activities and resources.  Participants will achieve the following during this event: 1) identify BI and outreach needs of the EPSCoR community; 2) identify, introduce, and evaluate BI resources and tools from well-established groups such as the Center for the Advancement of Informal Science Education and the Institute for Broadening Participation; 3) identify what functionality gaps exist in the current BI platforms that are required by the EPSCoR community; 4) create a set of BI “user stories” (i.e. use cases) that would be used to document the requisite functionality; 5) discuss how the development of a EPSCoR BI network could be integrated into a Hub or Ecosystem for the broader community; and  6) identify funding opportunities to develop, pilot test, scale and sustain the system.  The outcomes of this project will elevate the visibility and importance of broader impact activities, and their intertwined research activities, in a scalable and transformative way.

"As the world?s population and energy demands increase, our global reliance on fossil fuel resources to provide this energy puts an incredible strain on the environment. The modern biorefinery could produce sustainable energy by converting lignocellulosic biomass to fuels through thermal and chemical routes. However, one of the primary issues with using pyrolysis (heating in the absence of oxygen) as a thermochemical conversion technique is the need for significant fuel upgrading to improve stability and increase the heating value of the oil. Though bio-oils can be upgraded post-production, current methods suffer from catalyst poisoning and high materials and operation costs. This research project aims to address these issues by incorporating inorganic compounds, such as metal nitrates and acetates into cellulosic feedstocks, to simultaneously engineer high-value nanomaterials via bio-templating and catalytically upgrade pyrolysis bio-oils, thus reducing the need for costly downstream upgrading. Using machine learning based techniques, such as materials informatics for potential catalyst selection and statistical design of experiments, to inform process variable decisions, the proposed work will add to a fundamental body of knowledge on in situ upgrading of thermochemically derived biofuels while offering a new paradigm in computationally informed, experimentally verified renewable fuel design.

The proposed research will focus on upgrading of biofuels during pyrolysis by simultaneously making bio-templated nanoparticles. Materials Informatics approaches will be used to select in situ pyrolysis catalysts and surrogate reactions will be used to predict (and then validate via integrated feedback loop) potential reaction pathways and formed nanomaterial structure.  By developing a new Pyrolysis Product Index that looks at where, for example, oxygen goes during pyrolysis, and how yields of marker compounds change upon catalyst incorporation, the principal investigators aim to synthesize a new way to discuss biofuel upgrading pathways, helping to standardize what is a rather diverse literature in terms of what is deemed to be a good pathway. The project also aims to elucidate the physical changes occurring during pyrolysis of metal-impregnated biomass using in operando Raman spectroscopy through an international collaboration with a group from Queens Mary University (United Kingdom). The objective is to improve our knowledge of which reaction pathways are most critical to devolatilization, and how to better design catalysts to improve both primary pyrolysis and to limit secondary reactions, such as re-condensation, and to promote cracking, thereby reducing tar formation. The proposed work also involves nanomaterials characterization to understand the process variables impacting size, morphology and crystallinity of bio-templated nanomaterials.  Advances in fundamental science stemming from the proposed work may lead to the design of an optimized integrated biorefinery to convert renewable sources to energy and materials. In addition to training graduate and undergraduate students in research, there ae plans to engage and mentor underrepresented students and develop and international graduate student exchange between Cornell, Boston and Queen Mary Universities. An active learning module for renewable energy applications will be developed, implemented and assessed in the three participating universities.

"Bacterial inoculants can enhance crop yields and reduce reliance on expensive and environmentally harmful chemical fertilizers which are needed to meet the demand for food of the expected global population of 9.7 billion by 2050. To be useful in the field, bacterial inoculants must not only express plant growth beneficial traits but must also be able to colonize plant roots.  Further, many bacteria selected in the laboratory as bio-inoculants fail to consistently produce plant growth enhancements once applied in greenhouses or in the fields . This highlights shortcomings in our understanding of the behavior and physiology of beneficial bacteria in the rhizosphere. This project aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which bio-inoculant bacteria coordinate expression of plant growth beneficial traits (nitrogen fixation) with functions that are critical for competitiveness in the rhizosphere and colonization of plant roots (chemotaxis).  The knowledge gained from this research will contribute toward better predictive models to guide strategies to select and/or design beneficial diazotrophs for bio-inoculation applications, to improve crop management with benefits to society. In addition to addressing challenges related to sustainable agriculture through basic research, the project will engage a diverse community of participants in developing future solutions to these challenges.  The project will provide research opportunities for high school and undergraduate students, including members from underrepresented groups, with those students included as co-authors in publications, when appropriate. The principal investigator will also continue engagement of deaf-and-hard-of-hearing undergraduate students in research experiences. The project will also provide graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow with opportunities to mentor undergraduate students and to apply their research communication skills in a breadth of outreach activities.

Preliminary data suggest that bacterial chemotaxis signaling proteins regulate the expression of nitrogen fixation in the beneficial plant-colonizing and bio-inoculant diazotroph, Azospirillum brasilense.  The investigators aim to determine the molecular mechanisms by which bacterial chemotaxis signaling proteins coordinate the induction of nitrogen fixation in diazotroph soil bacteria used as biofertilizers worldwide, and the role of this coupling in the rhizosphere, using genetics, live cell fluorescence microscopy and biochemical approaches. They will also explore the mechanism of an apparent similar coupling between metabolism and chemotaxis signaling in the pea symbiont, Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae. Objective 1 will establish the mechanism(s) of chemotaxis signaling control of nitrogen metabolism in A. brasilense and specifically test the hypothesis that chemotaxis signaling proteins interact with an energy-responsive protein(s) to affect the expression of a transcriptional regulator of nitrogen fixation, RpoN. The spatio-temporal pattern of nitrogen fixation expression in the wheat rhizosphere and how chemotaxis affects this activity will also be determined. Objective 2 will decipher how a subset of chemoreceptors adjust chemotaxis signaling to support A. brasilense nitrogen fixation in the wheat rhizosphere. The role of oxygen- and energy-sensing chemoreceptors in affecting chemotaxis sensory specificity, nitrogen fixation and root colonization will be characterized. In addition, the role of one of these chemoreceptors in maintaining chemotaxis signaling arrays structural integrity will be elucidated. Objective 3 will explore how chemotaxis signaling array composition, which is affected by nutrient starvation, regulates nitrogen-fixing nodulation in R. leguminosarum. Together, the results obtained will provide insight into how distinct molecular functions (chemotaxis and nitrogen metabolism) evolved to become integrated within cells. These findings will also produce strategies to improve the performance of diazotroph bioinoculants by elucidating general design principles for the control of traits that contribute to rhizosphere plant-growth promoting competence. The research will employ genetically tractable model systems relevant to modern agriculture to address pressing environmental issues and sustainable agricultural practices. The results of this research will contribute toward better predictive models to guide strategies to select and/or design beneficial diazotrophs for bio-inoculation applications. This award is being co-funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, along with the Plant Biotic Interactions program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.

"Eighty percent of the U.S. population lives in urban areas. As hubs for economic powerhouses, urban communities generate around 85% of tthe U.S. GDP.  Therefore, the sustainability of urban communities underpins the sustained prosperity of the Nation.   Large urban cities across the U.S. are increasingly faced with the rapidly decaying infrastructure, critical maintenance and repair needs across city systems, and a need for modernization.  Sustaining the urban infrastructures and their quality of service to the evolving climatic and socio-economic demands call for innovative strategies for their adaptations.  This workshop will explore the potential of biological systems, which demonstrate amazing adaptation strategies to extreme climatic conditions, i.e., extreme cold, extreme hot, marsh, salinity, and drought, to provide a rich repository of information as source of inspiration for the smart adaptation of urban infrastructure.  The outcome of the workshop will be to design a research and educational roadmap and to build a convergent research community to explore the frontier of bio-inspired adaptation of urban infrastructure systems.
  
The workshop on Bio-Inspired Adaptation for Urban Infrastructure Systems will leverage the intelligence and adaptation strategies of biological and ecological systems as sources of inspiration for creating new approaches to design and implementation of adaptive urban infrastructure systems. The workshop program will focus on four major thrust areas: adaptation in biological/ecological systems; bio-inspired adaptive infrastructure systems; bio-inspired adaptive decision and governance; and education and workforce planning for urban adaptation. The workshop will be a two-day event providing various opportunities for team-building, keynote speeches, panels, facilitated group discussions, and poster sessions. This program will facilitate transdisciplinary exchange among researchers, practitioners, community leaders, and decision-makers. The workshop will provide extensive opportunities for dynamic interactions among attendees who bring together transdisciplinary expertise, with the aim of advancing the science of the urban sustainability.

"Non-technical Abstract: 

Ice recrystallization, where large ice crystals replace small ones, is a critical problem that impacts quality and functional property of biomaterials, such as food, biomedical tissues, and cell cultures during freezing storage. Ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) is the restriction of the growth of ice crystals caused by fluctuations in freezing temperature. Although synthetic chemicals can be used as ice growth inhibitors, their wide application is limited due to toxicity. This research, based on exciting preliminary findings, aims to understand how peptides obtained from hydrolysis (breakdown due to reaction with water) of food proteins can act as an IRI agent and how minor structural modification will enhance such effect. The research will address the relationship between molecular structure and IRI activity so that the mechanism of action can be better understood. These bio-based peptides are expected to have adequate IRI activity and low toxicity. They will have a wide range of applications in the food industry (increasing quality of frozen foods), agriculture (increasing resistance of plant to freezing temperatures), medicine (cold storage of cells and tissues), and material technology (deicing road or aircraft and climate control). The knowledge gained and evaluation tools established from this study will provide insights to future fundamental biomaterial chemistry research. This project will provide STEM education to underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students. The training will increase students’ understanding of the role of fundamental chemistry in advancing science through addressing the current challenges and needs. It will have a long-lasting impact on the students’ appreciation of applying basic knowledge in problem-solving. The students will also grow in key skills to become future biomaterial researchers through leadership training, and introduction to FDA and EPA regulations of new bio-based compounds and intellectual property protection and technology adoption. Successful recruitment and training of minority students will diversify student profile in the department and college and create an inclusive and enriching environment for all.   

Technical Abstract: 

Ice recrystallization and growth during freezing storage is a critical challenge that remains to be addressed. Bio-based and safe compounds are urgently needed to avoid the toxicity of synthetic anti-freezing agents. Based on the exciting earlier findings of the investigators’ group, this project aims to investigate ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) using peptides that are derived from common food proteins through biocatalyzed hydrolysis and amidation reactions. The relationship among peptides’ structure, physicochemical properties, and IRI activity will be established. The fundamental understanding of how peptides’ H-bonding ability and their amphiphilicity affect IRI activity will be gained. The ice-water interfacial behaviors influenced by peptides will be studied using a novel vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopic method. Therefore, this research addresses what is currently unknown in the field, i.e., how the bio-based peptides’ molecular characteristics relate to their IRI activity. Although theories of IRI have been tested for some pure compounds, little is known about peptide mixtures from common proteins. The structural diversity of proteins and peptides has made the structure-function studies challenging, and this is to be addressed by studying group characteristics in this work. The proposed quantification of H-bond and amphiphilicity as the key factors for IRI activity is a novel angle for IRI research, and the use of advanced spectroscopy will provide new insights on mechanisms of action. Hence, this research demonstrates the use of innovative approaches to identify bio-compatible materials for maintaining quality and integrity of biological systems under freezing conditions. This research will provide transformative experience for graduate students and undergraduate research assistants in their appreciation of how chemistry principles are used in problem-solving. Successful recruitment and training of students with diverse backgrounds will provide an enriching environment in the academic communities within the college and in the local community. Students’ practice of essential skills of critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork, and leadership will lead to the development of future biomaterial researchers and an highly capable and adaptable workforce.

Optimized during hundreds of millions of years of evolution, biomineralized tissues frequently display an extraordinary level of performance. Bone, for example, displays high toughness at low weight and is capable of self-repair; some invertebrate teeth self-sharpen despite continuous wear. Organisms typically form these materials under mild conditions through environmentally sustainable processes, making them appealing targets for bio-inspired or bio-enabled syntheses. Despite the abundance of such materials in nature, many biological mechanisms that allow the organism to control their formation remain poorly understood. As a model organism, sea urchins exert remarkable control over mineralization, creating smoothly curving and branched, yet single crystalline endoskeletal spicules of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Previously, the team designed an in vitro culture system of sea urchin embryo primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) to control the growth of these spicules in the laboratory. They discovered that a signaling protein, VEGF, controls the shape of spicules deposited by PMCs. The team will next probe the roles of a number of proteins that have been identified as potential crystal growth regulators in transcriptomics experiments. Techniques include, proteomics, in vitro assays in microfluidic droplet reactors, and knock-down experiments in vivo. In combination, these studies will lead to an improved understanding of biologically controlled mineralization. Poised at the intersection of molecular biology, materials science, and bioengineering, this research has the potential to inform a wealth of new technologies, from bio-inspired and bio-enabled materials to materials for carbon dioxide sequestration. The team will to leverage the interdisciplinary potential of this research to train undergraduate and graduate students from a broad range of backgrounds. An undergraduate research assistant will learn fundamental biological laboratory skills while also using advanced materials characterization techniques. Finally, the team will utilize instrumentation developed as part of a NSF Major Research Instrumentation grant to help undergraduate students visualize phase transformations in seawater, thus broadening the project?s reach to fundamental materials science education.

Technical abstract: 
The proposed activities address gaps in the understanding of how living organisms control crystal growth processes, with the long-term objective to develop bio-inspired and bio-enabled materials. In prior work, the team discovered the role of VEGF signaling in branching of endoskeletal single crystals of calcite that are deposited by primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) of the sea urchin embryo. Going forward, the team will use quantitative proteomics to confirm proteins that have been identified by transcriptomics as candidates involved in crystal growth control. Selected proteins will be produced recombinantly, and recombinant antibodies (rAbs) will be raised against them. rAbs will be used to map proteins across the spicule deposition vesicle and the spicule itself. In parallel, the team will use existing microfluidic devices to dissect the impact of native and recombinant proteins, individually and collectively on nucleation, polymorph selection, and crystal growth. Finally, the team will complement these experiments with functional analyses in vivo. Taken together, the team expects to develop a detailed mechanistic understanding of how expression of the relevant proteins, localization in the spicule matrix, and impact on nucleation kinetics and crystal growth may be connected. This is an important first step towards translating key molecular players into a system that is more easily engineered and scaled up, using the tools of synthetic biology for materials processing. The team will thereby address all four challenges in hard materials identified in the Report on the 2012 NSF Biomaterials Workshop. Complementary to the proposed research objectives, the team will engage undergraduates in research, incorporate research outcomes into undergraduate laboratory modules, and host high school interns through Northwestern University's Science in Society program.

"Nonrenewable resources underpin our country’s critical infrastructure and as a result, many of our renewable resources are underutilized or wasted. The current housing economy operates on a model that damages the environment rather than a circular one that coexists with it. For example, buildings emit more than one-third of greenhouse gases globally and lumber mills producing housing construction materials currently convert only 40% of wood volume to lumber, leaving the remainder to be disposed of. This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaboration (RII Track-2 FEC) award will allow University of Idaho and Auburn University project teams to create a foundational framework to utilize renewable and waste feedstocks to make and utilize 100% bio-based materials for the Advanced Housing Manufacturing Industry of the Future. This project’s research activities and those developing the future workforce for this industry will be performed by a diverse interjurisdictional and interdisciplinary team, laying the foundation for transformational change in one of the country’s largest industries, housing construction. It will provide outreach to high school chemistry students and educate college undergraduate and graduate students, as well as mentor postdoctoral scholars and early-career faculty members. Two NSF EPSCoR states, Idaho and Alabama, will experience economic enhancements from this project’s technology developments and industry partnerships that capitalize on their strong timber industries.

The overall goal of this project is to develop the science, technology, and educational frameworks required to enable an Advanced Housing Manufacturing Industry of the Future through the necessary intersection of unique interdisciplinary collaborations. Specifically, project teams at the University of Idaho and Auburn University will: 1) fractionate and characterize (via spectroscopy) bio-oils, chemically transform the oils into resins, and incorporate nanofibrillated cellulose to improve their properties; 2) develop additive manufacturing technology that is compatible with thermosetting type wood/bio-resin composites, incorporate reinforcing agents, such as biochar and long natural fibers, evaluate the properties of the composites via rheometry, thermal analysis, and spectroscopy, and 3-D print prototype building wall panels for evaluation; 3) evaluate, simulate, and predict composite material performance through ASTM tests, and incorporate fire and durability test data into neural network models to optimize material performance; and 4) promote housing construction market transformation toward more resilient building paradigms by developing resilience assessment tools for the architecture, engineering and construction industry and municipalities, and to develop curricular and pedagogical strategies for educating these stakeholders. These and other project activities will educate approximately 100 high school, 40 undergraduate, and nine graduate students, as well as train three postdoctoral scholars, and mentor six early-career faculty members. This project also utilizes a mentor-network approach to achieve a superior mentoring experience for the and foster broader collaborations among the team’s researchers. The scientific knowledge gained from this project will allow for better use of timber waste materials in two EPSCoR states, Idaho and Alabama, thereby increasing housing affordability and sustainability, ultimately contributing to the mitigation of climate change.

"Nontechnical Abstract:
The electrical systems that living organisms employ for bio- computations, such as sensing, intelligent responsiveness, and adaptation, require much less power than currently available man-made electronic systems. This project is developing ultralow-power electronic components and systems for signal retrieval, processing, and storage with power consumption comparable to biological systems. The project takes a fundamentally new approach to improving computing efficiency and storage capacity that can form the basis for self-sustained living or hybrid micro-electronic systems. These electronics that have power requirements similar to biology can naturally interface with biological systems, which is important for potential applications in brain-mimic computation, self-sustained microbots, advanced human-machine interfaces, and prosthetics. The interdisciplinary nature of the research provides an excellent platform for outreach and broadening participation in STEM education.
 
Technical Abstract:
Bioinspired electronics, such as sensing, computing, and memory devices, have generated substantial interest because of their potential high efficiency in information retrieval, processing, and storage. Although functional emulation of biological systems has led to many emerging high-performance electronic devices, there is a fundamental difference in the signal amplitude and power requirements. Biological signal processing, such as sensory detection, neural computation, and memory consolidation, uses action potentials (50-100 mV) that approach the thermodynamic limit, whereas conventional electronic systems function with much higher amplitude (> 0.5 V). As a result, the functional emulation of biosystems has not yet reached the ultralow-power information processing found in biosystems, ultimately limiting the integration density or capacity of computation and storage. The goal of the project is to investigate mechanisms and integrate principles in synthetic materials, electronics, and biology to realize computing devices, memory, and sensors that can function at biological-power levels. Borrowing materials and principles from microbes, the general method is to develop hybrid electronic materials, components, and systems. The research team employs specific approaches including: (i) harnessing catalytic principles in microbial systems to lower the functional voltage in electronics, (ii) incorporating bio-derived materials in devices to improve performance, and (iii) creating efficient interfaces between electronics and microbes to enable self-supported systems. These advances are expected to establish the foundation for future ultralow-power information processing, which is fundamentally related to the ultimate computing efficiency and storage capacity.

This SemiSynBio-II program (NSF 20-518) grant supports research on biological signal processing, such as sensory detection, neural computation, and memory consolidation with funding from the Division of Materials Research (DMR) of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate (MPS), the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) of the Biological Sciences Directorate (BIO),the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF) of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate (CISE), and the Division of Electrical,Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) of the Engineering Directorate (ENG).

"Ptychography refers to an imaging technique where overlapping regions of an object are illuminated, usually by placing a pinhole (and possibly a mask) between a light source and the object, and sequentially moving the pinhole. The resulting diffraction patterns are then sampled and used to calculate an approximate image of the object. The underlying physics of this imaging process dictates that one can only directly collect the intensity of the diffraction patterns, and not the critically important phase information. This makes the recovery of an accurate image extremely challenging. Nevertheless, through careful application of heuristic algorithms, practitioners have successfully employed these methods in a vast array of important applications such as the study of drug delivery mechanisms in complex bio-molecules, study of solar cells and battery chemistry, and the study of fracture dynamics in materials science. Despite these impressive results, several challenges remain, including the need to image larger and larger specimens at increasingly higher resolutions, and the growing size of datasets generated by a new generation of advanced imaging apparatus. This project seeks to develop fast, highly efficient, noise-robust, and mathematically rigorous computational methods in support of this next generation of high-throughput, high-resolution ptychographic imaging. The broader impacts of this project include curriculum development and training of students, including those from underrepresented groups, application of the computational methods to bio-imaging applications in the lab, and knowledge dissemination to raise the scientific literacy of the public.

Mathematically, much progress has been recently made in understanding ptychographic imaging and in analyzing novel algorithms for signal recovery from phase-less measurements. However, these algorithms and their attendant analysis often assume one collects the modulus of generalized linear measurements, where the discretized measurements are highly random. In line with applications, a focus of this project is on designing practical measurement schemes of the type actually used in ptychographic imaging. Another major difficulty in realistic phase-less imaging applications is that the imaging system's measurement masks/probes can often only be approximately implemented and partially known. Hence, another major objective of this project is the development of novel theoretical and algorithmic results for the blind ptychography problem. In either case, the emphasis is on constructing provably accurate recovery algorithms that are fast enough to scale to large problems in multiple dimensions. These tasks require developing and using a broad range of mathematical tools. Techniques from time-frequency analysis, frame theory, spectral graph theory, high-dimensional probability, and compressive sensing will be necessary for analyzing the measurement schemes and for providing rigorous theoretical guarantees for the developed recovery algorithms. Finally, a key component of this project is the application of these computational methods to real ptychographic phase-less imaging setups and bio-imaging applications. More specifically, a novel wide-field, high-resolution lense-less on-chip microscopy platform will be designed, which puts the theoretical techniques developed as part of this project into practice.

"Rajeev Prabhakar of the University of Miami is supported by an award from the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry to develop bio-inspired catalysts for hydrolysis.  The selective hydrolysis of the phosphate ester, and peptide amide bonds of bio-macromolecules is required in many critical applications such as DNA repair, protein engineering, genomics and therapeutics. In nature, these extremely stable bonds are hydrolyzed by highly specialized enzymes. However, currently only a few natural enzymes have been successfully employed for the aforementioned applications but with some deficiencies. Therefore, the development of small molecules that can mimic the activities of natural enzymes is of interest. However, realization of this goal is very challenging and necessitates a rigorous integration of experiments and theoretical calculations. In this project, Dr. Prabhakar will first derive the guiding principles of phosphate ester, peptide and carboxylate ester hydrolysis and then work to apply these principals to the design of efficient and specific catalysts for such hydrolysis reactions. Additionally, Dr. Prabhakar is actively involved in providing educational and research opportunities to members of minority groups at the high school through undergraduate levels. These outreach activities include the Honors and Executive Internship Program (HEIP) of the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the American Chemical Society's (ACS) Project SEED (Summer Experiences for the Economically Disadvantaged) and a summer workshop called CATCH-Computational and Theoretical Chemistry for High School and a High School Research Journal (HRJ). The undergraduate students will be provided research opportunities through specialized courses, a summer research program and support from the NSF. 
 
With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Rajeev Prabhakar of the University of Miami is studying the mechanism of the hydrolysis of phosphate ester, peptide and carboxylate ester bonds with theoretical calculations.  The results are then to be utilized for the development of efficient bio-inspired metal-based catalysts. The catalysts developed in this project are expected to be robust and tunable. This goal requires a deep understanding of the roles of distinct chemical factors that govern the activities of both natural enzymes and their existing synthetic analogues. In this proposal several state-of-the-art theoretical and computational chemistry techniques involving molecular dynamics, quantum mechanics (QM) and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) are integrated with a wide range of experiments to design the next generation of catalysts. In support of the broader impact of the project, Dr. Prabhakar is actively training and engaging current and future generations of students at the graduate, undergraduate and high school levels from socio-economic and educationally disadvantaged families.

"Technical Abstract
Biomaterials-based three-dimensional hydrogels that better reflect the extracellular microenvironment of native tissues are important for tissue repair and regeneration as well as cell-matrix interaction studies. Importantly, the biochemical signals between cell and surrounding matrix are dynamic over multiple time (seconds-weeks) and length (nm-cm) scales, and are dependent on tissue stiffness. Therefore, materials engineered to modulate cell response must be similarly dynamic in their spatio-temporal presentation of bio-ligands and material stiffness. Although hydrogels that control spatial and temporal presentation of bio-ligands by use of external triggers have been realized, these hydrogels have not yet provided 3 key properties: a) spatial control of cell signaling, b) simultaneous temporal presentation of bio-adhesivity, and c) independent control of bio-adhesivity and material stiffness to parse individual contributions to cell modulation. This NSF CAREER award, funded by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research, will enable development of a new class of nanocomposite hydrogels with control over the above mentioned three key properties within a single hydrogel. This work will advance current understanding of the role of biomaterial properties in controlling human stem cell fate through user-directed spatio-temporal control of cell-matrix interactions. This work will make interactive inquiry based learning permeate the underprivileged middle and high schools by training teachers and students. This CAREER award will grow the infrastructure of US engineers, in particular those from underrepresented minorities, with strong disciplinary competence in biomaterials through pedagogy and cutting-edge research.

Non-Technical Abstract
Biomaterials-based 3D hydrogels that better reflect the niche of native tissues and capture critical aspects of the dynamic microenvironment are of increasing importance for culturing of mammalian cells, including stem cells, for a wide range of applications in biomedicine. The flow of information between cells and their surrounding niche is spatially and temporally dependent on biochemical signals and cell-cell interactions. Despite advancement in the field of biomaterials, independent role of spatio-temporal biochemical signaling and biophysical properties of materials cannot be effectively studied using a single hydrogel system. This NSF CAREER award will overcome the current bottlenecks in biomaterials research by enabling the development of a new class of hydrogel that dynamically communicates with cells to control their fates. The proposed research will benefit society by developing advanced bio-functional tissues for regenerative medicine. In particular we expect this work to generate dynamic biomaterials for better understanding of stem cells and their interactions with local surroundings that will help treatment of neurological disorders and enable regeneration of neural grafts for short and long nerve gaps. The outcomes of this research will catalyze potential avenues of investigation in multiple disciplines, including cell culture, tissue fabrication, blood vessel generation, drug delivery, tumor engineering, and implants. This work will make interactive inquiry based learning permeate the underprivileged middle and high schools by training teachers and students.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a the development of a Bio-Zipper technology to improve outcomes in internal tissue closures related to Lower Urinary Tract Reconstructive (LUTR) surgery.  Collaboration with surgeons, healthcare providers, and robotic surgery specialists will determine how to best develop, modify, and optimize the Bio-Zipper to ensure that it will not only be highly effective, but also highly adopted by leaders in the field. Once the device is optimized to lower the hurdles to successful internal closures in LUTR surgery, the device utilization will be expanded into other areas of minimally invasive surgery where internal tissue closure is challenging, such as reconstructions following gastrointestinal tract procedures, appendiceal procedures, and proctectomy. The Bio-Zipper will lower the skill-based barriers to successful robotic surgeries and provide a consistent, reliable closure method. This device, with small modifications based on the target tissue, may result in improved patient outcomes by allowing for more minimally-invasive robotic surgical options in clinically challenging areas. The device may drive the adoption of more complex robotic surgeries in a larger number of medical centers.

This I-Corps project focuses on a Bio-Zipper technology that lowers the hurdles to successful internal closures in Lower Urinary Tract Reconstruction  surgery.  The use of the device may also be expanded into other areas of minimally-invasive surgery where internal tissue closures are challenging. The Bio-Zipper Luminal Repair Device for LUTR addresses practice gaps directly through the development of a biomimetic adhesive patch with mechanical properties tuned to those of the tissue to which it has been applied. The device is specifically designed to ensure distribution of tension across the repair and to provide watertight, stable support despite physiologic, intermittent bladder filling during the healing process. The device has the potential to improve quality of life and outcomes for children and adults undergoing LUTR via rapid, consistent closures that will facilitate the transition to minimally invasive, intracorporeal, patient-driven diversion selection.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a bio-inspired ground anchor technology. Ground anchors are a structural component of many retaining walls and building foundations that resist forces attempting to pull the structure from the ground by transferring those forces to the surrounding soil. Such forces are called pullout loads. The conventional ground anchor may be fabricated and installed easily using simple tooling and components, but they are not highly efficient at resisting pullout loads. An economically competitive alternative to conventional ground anchors must be nearly as simple to install and more efficient in its use of materials. The proposed technology uses a bio-inspired root design to meet these criteria. The geometric design of root systems resists pullout loads more efficiently than the cylindrical external interfaces of conventional ground anchors. The proposed technology seeks to develop higher pullout load capacities than conventional anchors within a shorter bonded length. Shorter anchors use less cement and steel, require less drilling, consume less diesel fuel, and require fewer working hours to install.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a root-inspired ground anchor system. Prototypes have been studied in the lab as well as in preliminary field trials and they have demonstrated the feasibility of installing, expanding, and loading the bio-inspired system. The ongoing research is focused on scaling-up the technology to full field-scale using both numerical simulations and field tests on instrumented anchors. The proposed anchor consists of three primary components: a stressing element identical to the steel cables or bars used in conventional ground anchors; an expansive root mechanism, which is initially cylindrical but expands during installation to mimic the geometry of plant roots; and cement grout, which gives the systems stiffness and protects its components from corrosion. Certain plant species have root systems that anchor the organism in the soil much more efficiently than any ground anchors currently used in civil infrastructure; Their capacity to resist pullout loads is very high relative to the mass of the root system.  The expansive root mechanism of the proposed technology seeks to use the geometric principles of these root systems to resist pullout loads more efficiently than the cylindrical external interfaces of a conventional ground anchor.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate proof-of-concept for a new clean energy technology that uses protein nanostructures to serve as a safe alternative, or supplement, to traditional batteries. The goal is to create power units that are 100% recyclable, preventing toxic electronic waste from accumulating in landfills, and that generate continuous power, reducing the direct and labor costs associated with replacing traditional batteries.  These costs are a significant hurdle that slows the widespread adoption and use of low-power, high-value electronics such as networks of industrial Internet of Things (IoT) sensors.  The project may also address applications, such a flammable gas sensors, where traditional batteries are not typically used to due to safety concerns.  This Phase 1 project is focused on the initial development of a safe and sustainable replacement for batteries using a technology that provides continuous renewable energy and is made with non-toxic recyclable materials.

The intellectual merits of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on developing a prototype device that uses protein nanostructures to generate clean power by means of a new method of energy harvesting that leverages environmental humidity. The research objectives are to (i) fabricate standardized, reliable and reproducible testbed devices; (ii) demonstrate the feasibility of commercial-scale production of a range of protein nanostructures; and (iii) to evaluate these protein nanostructures using our testbed devices. The testbed prototype devices will be made using commercially scalable processes. Devices made using the protein nanostructures will be evaluated using electrochemical and electronic characterization techniques.  The goals of the project are to successfully fabricate thin-film power generation devices, prove commercial-scale production of protein nanostructures, evaluate the power output, and demonstrate a novel mechanism of action of power generation from the devices.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide an innovative approach to improve crop tolerance using novel seed treatments. To feed the growing world population (estimated 9.8 billion by 2050), global food production must increase by 70%, while reducing impact on land use, the environment, and ecosystems. However, high salinity conditions and drought have reduced the potential yield of crops; furthermore, the excessive application of fertilizers is disrupting global nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, reducing biodiversity, and causing aquatic pollution. This project will develop a technology to promote crop growth through improved stress tolerance and nutrient acquisition. The adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices could help farmers in increasing their profitability and reduce costs. This project will offer an effective solution to 570 million farms around the world for food production. By improving crop yield, the project could help address the economic loss of more than $27 billion/year in the US due to unproductive farmland. 

The proposed project will generate innovative endophyte-based formulations for seed treatments to improve tolerance to abiotic stress. Seeds will be coated with a mixture of highly characterized safe (non-pathogenic) endophytic bacteria and yeast strains in formulation with selected osmoprotectants and prebiotics that improve the survivability and efficacy of the selected microbes. The bio-inoculants will improve crop tolerance to salinity stress while supporting nitrogen fixation and mineral nutrient acquisition. This project will validate the feasibility of this approach on treatments for selected vegetable seeds. First efforts will be dedicated to obtaining stable seed treatment formulations with a high shelf-life when used at scale in parallel with fungicide and insecticide treatments. The ability of bio-inoculant formulations to increase tolerance to salinity will be validated in the greenhouse. Finally, the performance of the most optimal formulation will be tested in a small field trial under high salinity conditions to validate its ability to increase crop yield and quality.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide domestic production of renewable, biomass-based alternatives to products currently made from oil.  This SBIR Phase II project will demonstrate the commercial potential of producing 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO), a key chemical used to manufacture coatings, adhesives, and plastics, from agricultural wastes like corn cobs. Biomass-based chemicals can decrease the nation's dependence on oil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while providing cost-competitive high-performance chemical products. Creating high-value commodity chemicals using nonfood agricultural materials as feedstock promises to create new markets for bio-based waste products.

A chemical pathway to produce bio-based 1,5-pentanediol has been demonstrated in laboratory reactors using commercially relevant reactors and catalysts.  In this work a wide range of reactor operating conditions will be explored in the laboratory for scale-up of the process.

"The development of green separation and processing strategies to produce bio-based polymers is beneficial to ensure environmentally sustainable materials for future generations. Current monomer production methods typically use petroleum and require hazardous processes. Biomass offers diverse alternate starting materials for polymer chemistries. However, current strategies for isolating monomers from biomass and their polymerizations are limited and often not sustainable in practice. The development of sustainable bio-based polymers requires a holistic approach that tackles key sustainability issues associated with monomer sourcing and extraction, polymer creation, and end-point feedback. This project seeks to utilize residual biomass sources, green extraction techniques, and appropriate polymer syntheses to incorporate structurally rigid monomers (i.e. pentacyclic triterpenols) into the backbones of polymer networks and elucidate the fundamental relationship between processing, structure, and properties of these polyesters derived from natural feedstocks. Key considerations include the methodologies by which feedstocks are sourced, separated, and subsequently translated into useful polymers. Ultimately, knowledge gained will provide impetus for and education in the transformation of bio-refined products into macromolecules that meet the diverse needs of society.

Specific objectives target a fundamental understanding of the processing-structure-property relationships of bio-based polymers derived from green separation techniques. The project will holistically consider the choice of feedstock, extraction technique, polymer synthesis, and polymer degradation to ultimately produce environmentally sustainable processes and products. An iterative approach will use sustainability metrics throughout and will evaluate these metrics to determine the overall process viability from economic and environmental perspectives. By integrating process sustainability metrics into traditional processing-structure-property relationship methodology used in polymer development, the approach will shift the conventional polymer design paradigm to comprehensively address both polymer function and sustainability via the following interconnected, concurrent aims: (I) Leverage green solvent extraction to produce enriched monomer fractions from renewable feedstocks, (II) Sustainably develop polyester thermoplastics and thermosets derived from fractionated biomass, and (III) Evaluate process technoeconomic and life cycle sustainability.

"There are an estimated 500 volcanoes that emit volcanic gases to the atmosphere. This project will design, build, and field-test a collaborative swarm of flying robots called the Volcano Co-robot Adaptive Natural algorithms (VolCAN) swarm.  The VolCAN swarm will transform our ability to forecast volcanic eruptions. The swarm consists of multiple autonomous aerial drones that use algorithms inspired by biology to monitor the unpredictable environments surrounding volcanoes. In addition to monitoring gasses that precede volcanic eruptions, thereby protecting human lives, it will also measure how much carbon dioxide is emitted from volcanoes to better understand how they contribute to the global carbon budget. The VolCAN swarm can adapt to environmental conditions autonomously in real time, and it can also be guided by scientists to collect scientific data during the battery-limited flights of small drones. Our approach leverages the advantages of bio-inspired algorithms that are fast rather than perfectly accurate, and resilient rather than centrally controlled. The project will broaden participation in computing by involving students from underrepresented groups in both robotics research and programming courses.

This project will develop, analyze and rigorously test a co-robot swarm of unpiloted air vehicles (UAVs) that collect valuable scientific data in dynamic and unpredictable environments. The VolCAN swarm will use bio-inspired algorithms to detect CO2 plumes, descend plume gradients to measure maximum flux of CO2 from ground sources, estimate plume size, and infer maps of multiple CO2 sources over hundreds of square kilometers. Given battery limitations on flight times and dangerous, unpredictable conditions, the algorithms prioritize speed, robustness and interpretability over high accuracy. The novel bio-inspired algorithms scale to cover vast areas, adapt to the sensed environment to focus monitoring on the most important regions in real time, and are fast enough to collect many simultaneous emissions within the limited battery life of small UAV. Theoretical analyses will determine bounds on the speed and convergence times of the algorithms, and simulations and frequent field tests will measure the performance of the VolCAN system in rigorous, replicated experiments.  Additionally, the project will demonstrate that scientists can operate the VolCAN swarm to collect data in the field with either fully autonomous adaptive surveillance or with scientist guidance.  This approach combines human flexibility and judgment with the speed and mobility of a UAV swarm. The project will demonstrate the broad applicability of the VolCAN swarm in environmental monitoring applications in experiments to measure methane emissions from pipelines and assess ecological health of plant communities. It will also show that bio-inspired robots can function outside of highly-structured factories, labs, and warehouses to gather valuable scientific data in the hazardous and unpredictable environments of active volcanoes.

"This project aims to serve the national interest by helping students better understand the nature of scientific research.  Providing opportunities for students to participate in scientific research increases their chances of remaining on a STEM career path, especially for students from groups that are not yet equitably represented in STEM. However, many students do not find research opportunities on their own, suggesting that curricular reform is needed to bring research experiences to all students. This project builds on Authentic Inquiry through Modeling (AIM-Bio), a laboratory curriculum that provides students with opportunities to ask scientific questions and to develop their own experiments to test their questions. AIM-Bio has documented benefits for students, including increases in their ownership of their work, their identity as scientists, and their skills and knowledge about how science works. The project team seeks to bring the AIM-Bio curriculum to more than 1,700 students per year at the University of Arizona, a Hispanic Serving Institution. Meeting this challenge will require preparing the undergraduate and graduate students who serve as teaching assistants (TAs) for AIM-Bio laboratories, and who will thus be the principal instructors for AIM-Bio.  The project plans to develop a training program that will prepare the TAs to mentor students in scientific inquiry, the open-ended process of asking and answering science-based questions.  The project also intends study the alignment between TAs’ intentions about teaching and their actual interactions with students in the laboratory. By including a focus on the rationale behind TAs’ teaching decisions and actions, this project will provide novel insights to guide efforts to train TAs as teaching professionals.  

Through their personal interactions with students in laboratory sections, TAs hold an essential role in large-scale implementation of authentic-inquiry curricula. Prior research suggests that TAs may initially struggle with the open nature of an inquiry curriculum, often preferring to use forms of direct instruction consistent with more traditional views of teaching.  To develop training strategies that will support the TAs’ ability to enact authentic-inquiry instruction, it is critical to understand TAs’ perspectives about teaching challenges. To this end, the project aims to:  1) Develop a professional development curriculum to support TAs in course-based authentic inquiry instruction, and 2) Build a model to explain the relationship between TA intentions and actions when teaching a course-based authentic inquiry curriculum. Research methods will include stimulated recall interviews, which will ask TAs to reflect on episodes of their own teaching. The collected information will be analyzed to identify the relationships between TAs intentions for implementing curricular activities and the actions they take to interact with students during those activities. In addition to the interviews, recordings of TAs in the laboratory will be investigated using a unique analytical framework that captures the process of mentoring students in the scientific practice of modeling. Combined analysis of interviews and classroom mentoring will allow the project team to gain a holistic view of TAs' implementation of the AIM-Bio curriculum. Finally, to shed light on the potential consequences of TAs intentions and actions, the project team will compare student outcomes between TAs with different teaching approaches.  This project is funded by the NSF IUSE: EHR Program, which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.

"This project concerns a study of the combustion performance of an emerging bio-derived liquid fuel, isobutanol, and its mixtures with gasoline in an environment that promotes spherical flames during droplet combustion. The relevance of this work stems from the fact that combustion engines such as gasoline engines are powered by petroleum-based fuels, and the supplies of these fuels are limited. Therefore, the continuous consumption of these non-renewable liquid fuels and concerns over the harmful emissions have highlighted the need for renewable biofuels with sustainable production and reduced emissions. In this context, this work aims to provide a fundamental understanding of the combustion dynamics of biobutanol and its blends with practical transportation fuels to determine their potential performance in combustion engines. These efforts will significantly benefit society by guiding the development of improved fuel efficiency and providing insights into reducing harmful emissions, and thus offering solutions to climate change. Broader impacts from an educational perspective for this project include providing underrepresented minority students at both undergraduate and graduate levels with opportunities to conduct independent research, discover new knowledge, and explore practical applications. Furthermore, this work will offer various K-12 outreach opportunities. These programs will engage more minority students, attract them to pursue a career in science and engineering, and thus build a more diverse workforce in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).

The goal of this research is to deepen the fundamental understanding of the combustion processes of bio-derived liquid fuels as promising additives or alternatives for petroleum-based fuels. The specific objectives of this project are to (1) establish a cost-effective Multiphase Droplet Burning Facility at Prairie View A&M University to build the institutional research capacity as a Historically Black College and University in the areas of droplet combustion and thermo-fluids; (2) build an experimental platform to quantitatively extract Soot Volume Fraction during the combustion of isobutanol and its mixtures with petroleum-based fuels; and (3) develop an experimental database for the combustion of isobutanol to evaluate its potential for being a desirable additive for gasoline to reduce the consumption of petroleum-based liquid fuels as well as harmful emissions during combustion. Results obtained will advance the understanding of how bio-derived fuels combust in the context of petroleum-based liquid fuels. Experimental combustion data collected will also be a valuable database for the research community for developing, validating, and optimizing numerical models.

"This STTR Phase I project will develop a transformative platform for inexpensive screening for pancreatic cancer detection, based on profiling of cancer-related proteins from a small blood draw.  Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest types of cancer, killing over 50,000 each year in the US, and with a five-year survival rate below 7%.  However, currently there are no reliable diagnostic tests for pancreatic cancer, and the great majority of cases are detected at a late stage, with bleak mortality rates as a result.  As cancer is driven fundamentally by a dysregulation of key protein networks, directly measuring the activity of key proteins provides a robust bio-signature for cancer detection. The project will develop a scientifically novel diagnostic technology based on broad protein profiling for the accurate and low cost detection of pancreatic cancer, and thereby shift the therapeutic field of battle to an earlier stage of the disease, where the current treatments can be more effectively harnessed to improve patient outcomes and save lives, avoid unnecessary and ineffective procedures, and generate health system cost savings across the US and elsewhere. Commercialization of this diagnostic platform is expected to drive creation of a substantial enterprise, and related employment and tax-revenues.

The major innovation of this project is the breakthrough technology for monitoring the state of dozens of cancer-related proteins in biological samples and its application for diagnosing pancreatic cancer from a minute sample of a patient?s blood. The innovative platform has superior levels of sensitivity and accuracy compared to existing technologies, and also offers substantially lower costs, which are critical advantages for the diagnostic application. A further innovation in this project is the development of the analytic engine and the bio-signature knowledge base, that will be used for analysis of the patient?s protein profile.  In this project, the Company will focus on several key technical challenges to develop and validate a 1.0 version of its diagnostic platform for pancreatic cancer detection:  i. identifying a robust, differentiated multi-target, bio-signature for pancreatic cancer; and ii. doing so with an accuracy and at a sufficiently early stage in the cancer emergence and progression to be medically useful. This project will extensively profile biobank samples from various stages of pancreatic cancer and normal patients to generate the differentiated bio-signatures, develop a diagnosis prediction engine to match the bio-signatures and inform diagnoses, and validate those results using additional samples.

"A working knowledge of biology is increasingly important as society grapples with new genetic technologies, conservation, and the impacts of climate change. To help ensure a scientifically literate society that is prepared to deal with these issues, it is thus in the national interest to develop effective methods of teaching biological concepts. To that end, collaborations between scientists in discipline-based education research in biology (DBER-BIO) and learning sciences (LS; including cognitive, educational, and developmental psychology) have resulted in new theories and pedagogical strategies that advance understanding of learning in biology. Despite the benefits, however, these partnerships are relatively uncommon. Although the DBER-BIO and LS communities share the goal of understanding learning, connecting the two groups is often hindered by differences in training, methodologies, and practices. To facilitate collaboration between DBER-BIO and LS, the PI team will host a one-day workshop. The goals of the workshop are to develop connections between researchers from different disciplines, increase awareness of differences and similarities in perspectives towards education research, and equip participants with strategies for engaging in interdisciplinary work. Fostering these interdisciplinary collaborations will result in improved research on learning in biology that will ultimately improve undergraduate biology education.

This project will support a one-day workshop for researchers in the LS and DBER-BIO communities. The workshop will foster interdisciplinary connections and identify strategies for collaboration through three activities: small group work, a panel discussion session with researchers who have experience in interdisciplinary collaborations, and a poster session. By the end of the workshop, it is anticipated that participants will have gained an appreciation of the value of interdisciplinary research and be equipped to pursue it. Data collected during the workshop will include discussion comments, collaborative strategies, and responses to an end-of-workshop survey. This data will be analyzed qualitatively using an in vivo approach for the first cycle of coding and focused coding for the second cycle to identify workshop outcomes. In turn, these will be evaluated to determine if the anticipated outcomes were met and to identify barriers to and facilitators of interdisciplinary collaboration as well as productive collaborative strategies. The PI team intends to share the results of this analysis through a meeting report, thus enabling the insights and strategies generated in the workshop to reach a broad audience.This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in ""Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action"" (http://visionandchange/finalreport).

"Cities and farms discharge nitrogen-rich compounds into receiving waters, resulting in pollution of the environment. Current technologies to remove nitrogen-rich compounds from water are costly and energy intensive, resulting in great economic and environmental costs to society. The difficulty in addressing this waste problem is why the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine calls managing the nitrogen cycle one of the “Grand Challenges” of engineering. The goal of this project is to develop new scientific knowledge about how to concentrate, separate, and transform waste nitrogen-rich compounds into animal feed and beneficial products. This outcome will be achieved through cross-disciplinary biology and chemistry research to remove nitrogen-rich compounds from waste streams and to transform them into chemicals that can be used for the production of useful products. The environmental impact and potential for new businesses based on these new technologies will be evaluated. Successful completion of this work will prevent nitrogen pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and provide a new sustainable feedstock for chemicals. Other benefits from this project will include workforce development and educational outreach to underrepresented grade-school students.  These efforts will promote increased diversity in STEM fields and improve scientific literacy of the general public.

Nitrogen-rich waste streams are produced in large quantities from urban and agricultural settings and impose severe environmental burdens to human and ecological health. Conventional nitrogen management treats nitrogen-rich compounds as waste rather than as a recoverable resource. This approach is costly, energy intensive, and results in the release of large amounts of the potent greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (N2O). The goal of this research project is to develop novel technological approaches to convert nitrogen-rich waste into high-value products beyond fertilizers. This research project has the objectives to: (1) Engineer bacteria to bioconcentrate dilute waste nitrogen, which then can be used as animal feed or for bio-based chemical production; (2) Develop a microbial bioprocess for simultaneous nitrogen removal and nitrous oxide recovery for use as a green oxidant; (3) Design catalytic processes to capture and activate dilute nitrous oxide streams for the selective oxidation of methane; and (4) Identify optimal products, feedstocks, and technology combinations to satisfy diverse stakeholder needs and cost and sustainability objectives. The novelty of the approach lies in the energy-efficient recovery of nitrogen as a building block for bio-based chemicals and animal feed. This approach integrates expertise across chemical, biological, and environmental engineering disciplines. Successful completion of this research will benefit society through sustainable waste nitrogen management and the mitigation of nitrous oxide emissions. Additional benefits will result from educational and industrial outreach. Such efforts include outreach to underrepresented grade-school students in a climate action project.

"Fish and birds use complex high-speed maneuvers when chasing prey or escaping predators. How water and air flow around these animals during maneuvers is mostly unknown. Mapping out these flows will help biologists better understand the relationship between fish, birds, and their environment. Mapping out these flows will help bio-inspired roboticists, who currently rely on models of low-speed, symmetric gaits when designing and testing robots. Understanding the flows that govern rapid maneuvers will enable a new generation of fast, flexible, ultra-maneuverable bio-inspired robots. The principal goal of this project is therefore to discover the fluid dynamics that govern high-speed, asymmetric swimming/flying gaits. The project integrates educational activities, including virtual tours where students from rural high schools teleconference into the lab and remotely control a robotic swimming rig.

This project is made possible by a unique rig that creates high-frequency, asymmetric flapping motions in a water channel. The rig uses a scotch-yoke mechanism to double the frequencies traditionally available to studies of swimming and flying, and it floats on air bushings in order to simulate autonomous maneuvers. The performance of fish- and bird-inspired propulsion strategies are then quantified by a combination of Particle Image Velocimetry and dynamic force measurements. These experiments will inform adaptations to models of unsteady aerodynamics as they pertain to swimming and flying animals and robots. The experimental-theoretical campaign will focus on three specific research goals: (i) Determine what three-dimensional flow features govern the thrust and efficiency of high-frequency bio-inspired gaits, (ii) Determine what three-dimensional flow features govern the maneuverability of asymmetric bio-inspired gaits, and (iii) Determine what wake-driven models predict the performance of high-frequency, asymmetric, tunable-stiffness fins and wings. More generally, the project’s overarching goal is for the unique semiautonomous rig and the associated modeling to create new precedents and templates for those integrating fluid dynamics into the next generation of intelligent machines.

"In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms-B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Vladimir Popik of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Georgia (UGA) develops new photochemical reactions which have potential applications for drug delivery and activation. The fundamental chemistry is based on organic molecules which undergo light-induced dissociation,  and where carbon monoxide is one of the products. Since the opacity of tissues limits the amount of light that can be delivered to target areas in therapy, Professor Popik explores methods to boost the efficiency of the photo-induced released of molecules with the body through a quantum chain reaction. This is a process in which one packet (photon) of light causes multiple molecules to be released.  This strategy may allow for the selective treatment of localized malignancies, while avoiding common side effects of common chemotherapies. The project provides students with interdisciplinary training at the interface of synthetic and physical organic chemistry, as well as photochemistry and biochemistry. High school students conducting summer internship in Professor Popik's laboratory via the UGA Young Dawgs Program are exposed to modern scientific research.

The quantum efficiency of the photodecarbonylation reaction of cyclopropenones in the crystalline state is several times higher than in solution, and could exceed 400%. Professor Popik explores the mechanism of the quantum yield amplification phenomenon and parameters that control the energy propagation process in cyclopropenone crystals. Harnessing the quantum chain reaction allows for the production of several molecules of the product per one photon absorbed. Such photoreactions are especially important in the expected applications, where light delivery is hampered by the opacity or scattering properties of the medium. Nanocrystalline suspensions of specially designed cyclopropenone derivatives permit practical use of the quantum yield amplification. The covalent surface derivatization of the crystals and control of the size of the crystals allows for the preparation of stable suspensions or colloidal solutions and provides control over the transport and bio-distribution properties of nanocrystals. Light-directed delivery of bioactive substrates using cyclopropenone nanocrystalline suspensions offers very high light sensitivity, ability to control bio-distribution, and is accompanied by the release of carbon monoxide, which is an important bio-active agent in itself as well as a valuable adjuvant for anti-cancer  antibiotics.

"Many animals fly or swim near the surface of water or the ocean floor.  These boundaries create unsteady, three-dimensional, and asymmetrical flows that can increase the animal's flying/swimming speed and efficiency. Despite the wide implications of these benefits, there are no reliable models for near-boundary bio-locomotion. Accurate models could reshape the way biologists think about the flight strategies of birds migrating over open water or the evolutionary pressures on the shapes of bottom-dwelling fish. A better understanding of near-boundary lifestyles could help ecologists better predict the fragility of near-ground ecosystems to over-fishing, loss of habitat, or changing climate. Better models would also reshape the way engineers design bio-inspired vehicles that operate near boundaries. The key to improving these models is a better understanding of the complex flows governing near-boundary swimming and flying. The proposed work aims to shed light on these complex flows and bring them into public view using multimedia and an outreach program for middle school girls. 
 
The goal of this project is to understand the unsteady flow mechanisms governing near-boundary swimming. The project will support the first systematic study of unsteady ground effect through a combination of water channel experiments and inviscid flow simulations. As a result, classic steady ground effect theory will be generalized to the modern interdisciplinary flow phenomena present in swimming and flying animals. These flow phenomena will be explored by testing the effects of Strouhal number, reduced frequency, aspect ratio, undulation, and asymmetric kinematics on near-ground swimming. The research will focus on four specific aims: (i) developing scaling laws for the forces and energetics of near-ground swimming, (ii) mapping near-ground three-dimensional flow interactions, (iii) determining the role of undulatory kinematics in near-ground swimming, and (iv) understanding how asymmetrical kinematics alter near-ground flows. By including both experiments and inviscid simulations, the research will identify which effects are Reynolds-number dependent and which are driven purely by inviscid vortex dynamics.

"Many animals fly or swim near the surface of water or the ocean floor.  These boundaries create unsteady, three-dimensional, and asymmetrical flows that can increase the animal's flying/swimming speed and efficiency. Despite the wide implications of these benefits, there are no reliable models for near-boundary bio-locomotion. Accurate models could reshape the way biologists think about the flight strategies of birds migrating over open water or the evolutionary pressures on the shapes of bottom-dwelling fish. A better understanding of near-boundary lifestyles could help ecologists better predict the fragility of near-ground ecosystems to over-fishing, loss of habitat, or changing climate. Better models would also reshape the way engineers design bio-inspired vehicles that operate near boundaries. The key to improving these models is a better understanding of the complex flows governing near-boundary swimming and flying. The proposed work aims to shed light on these complex flows and bring them into public view using multimedia and an outreach program for middle school girls. 
 
The goal of this project is to understand the unsteady flow mechanisms governing near-boundary swimming. The project will support the first systematic study of unsteady ground effect through a combination of water channel experiments and inviscid flow simulations. As a result, classic steady ground effect theory will be generalized to the modern interdisciplinary flow phenomena present in swimming and flying animals. These flow phenomena will be explored by testing the effects of Strouhal number, reduced frequency, aspect ratio, undulation, and asymmetric kinematics on near-ground swimming. The research will focus on four specific aims: (i) developing scaling laws for the forces and energetics of near-ground swimming, (ii) mapping near-ground three-dimensional flow interactions, (iii) determining the role of undulatory kinematics in near-ground swimming, and (iv) understanding how asymmetrical kinematics alter near-ground flows. By including both experiments and inviscid simulations, the research will identify which effects are Reynolds-number dependent and which are driven purely by inviscid vortex dynamics.  This research will provide key insights into the near-ground lifestyles of fish and will aid in the design of novel bio-inspired underwater vehicles.

"New materials can be created by directing the assembly of fine-scale structures into optimal, desired patterns. This project is about controlling the shapes of things. Controlling the shapes of droplets can yield new micro-fluidic devices for bio-technology.  Understanding the shape and curvature of bio-membranes (e.g. cell membranes) can give new insight into how cells move and function. And human understanding and meaning can be extracted from high dimensional data if it is properly ""unfolded."" The goal of this research project is to create new mathematical methods/algorithms to guide self-organization, material design, and learn from high dimensional data.  This research will lay the groundwork for the optimal control of moving shapes and geometries. Part of this project involves interacting with elementary and middle school students to highlight the importance of geometry in applications through the PI's ""sit-with-a-scientist"" program. The program provides an informal atmosphere, with hands-on activities, to motivate students, especially minorities and under-represented groups, to pursue STEM.

The research objective is to create new mathematical techniques and numerical methods for self-organization. Some examples are self-assembly, controlling droplet shape (micro-fluidics), folding biomembranes, and data analysis/visualization through non-linear manifold reduction. These new methods will open new frontiers of material design, enable unprecedented control of physical phenomena, yield new understanding in micro-biology, and reign in ""big data"" so it can be directly visualized. The research will create the first numerical scheme for the singular Maier-Saupe potential for the Q-tensor-valued solution of the Landau-de Gennes (LdG) model. We also develop and analyze, unfitted finite element methods (FEMs) for LdG, on variable domains, that connect with the following items. We will create methods for controlling the time-dependent evolution of geometric structures in physics and engineering problems, e.g. in liquid crystals and liquid droplet shape. Design new methods for modeling and simulating bio-membranes that well approximate full curvature information (i.e. the full shape operator) using a surface finite element method. Moreover, we will extend our bio-membrane surface FEM techniques to do non-linear dimension reduction of high dimensional data to a low-dimensional space (for data analytics and visualization). Other aspects of the research will create open source software for the methods developed here, using both the PI's own packages, FELICITY and AHF, and other open-source options (e.g. Firedrake). In addition, the PI will educate elementary and middle school students using his ""sit-with-a-scientist"" program (mentioned above).

"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a gas produced by microbes in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, and, like other greenhouse gases, it contributes to global warming. Furthermore, N2O can destroy ozone, a gas responsible for protecting the earth from dangerous ultraviolet radiation. In the ocean, N2O production is largely controlled by the amount of available dissolved oxygen, with more N2O being produced under low oxygen concentrations; however, when no oxygen is available, a scenario referred to as anoxia, microbes in the ocean switch from producing N2O to consuming N2O. In recent years, it has become evident that zones of low oxygen are expanding in some areas of the oceans, and this has raised concern that more N2O will be produced. If this occurs, more N2O will be emitted to the atmosphere, and will lead to further global warming and ozone destruction. Because of this, research has largely focused on understanding how much N2O is produced in the ocean under low oxygen conditions. If, however, anoxic zones also increase in size, this could act to balance out, at least to some degree, the predicted increase in N2O production caused by the expansion of zones where oxygen is present but in low concentrations. This study aims to simultaneously measure N2O production and consumption, in both low oxygen and anoxic zones and identify the microbes responsible for N2O production and consumption. Our results will: 1) lead to a much better understanding of how N2O consumption in anoxic zones could help to balance out an increase in N2O production if low oxygen zones in the ocean continue to expand, 2) help to inform models aimed at predicting oceanic N2O production and emissions to the atmosphere under future ocean conditions, and 3) allow us to better understand the microbes involved in N2O production and consumption. Our study will support a postdoc and undergraduate students who will work at the interface of marine chemistry and community genomics. The PIs plan to specifically consider applications from underrepresented minorities and students at institutions with limited opportunities. The PIs also plan a number of other educational/outreach programs ranging from teacher-training workshops, teacher internships, and academic and public lecture series. 


The oceanic production of the potent greenhouse and ozone destroying gas nitrous oxide (N2O) increases as dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations transition from oxic to hypoxic. Marine DO concentrations have decreased globally with climate change and oceanic hypoxic zones have expanded and predicted to continue expanding. This increase is cause for concern that N2O production in the ocean will increase in the future which would lead to higher emissions to the atmosphere. As a result, much research has focused on quantifying the oxygen thresholds that correspond to large increases in N2O production. In contrast, relatively few studies have aimed to quantify the capacity for net N2O consumption, resulting from microbial N2O reduction to N2 under anoxic conditions, to buffer against predicted N2O production increases if anoxic zones expand in conjunction with hypoxic zones. To this end, this study aims to simultaneously quantify N2O production and consumption from oxic-hypoxic-anoxic water column zones, in order to determine the potential for N2O consumption to counteract predicted increases in N2O production. Our field work be conducted in Saanich Inlet, a British Columbian fjord which is an ideal natural laboratory for our study, as it is characterized by a well-established oxycline and anoxic zone. Specifically, we aim to 1) measure bulk N2O concentrations, and, using 15N tracer techniques, quantify N2O production and consumption rates as DO concentrations decrease from oxic to anoxic conditions, 2) quantify the magnitude by which N2O consumption in the anoxic zone balances increased N2O production in the overlying hypoxic region, and 3) definitively link observed N2O production and consumption rates to the microorganisms mediating this process, focusing specifically on distinguishing N2O consumption via denitrifier (NO3- to N2) versus non-denitrifier (N2O to N2 only) taxa. Ultimately, our results will provide quantitative information on N2O consumption rates over fluctuating ocean conditions, thereby helping constrain models of oxygen effects on net N2O production and ocean-to-atmosphere greenhouse gas fluxes. Furthermore, this work will identify the taxonomic breadth of microbes capable of N2O reduction and their linkage to actual N2O reduction rates, thereby providing a quantitative understanding of whether or not the detection of specific bio-signatures is predictive of marine N2O dynamics.

"Non-technical Abstract
Diffusion, one of the most common transport processes, is ubiquitous in biological systems and is often modeled as mixing of particles of different species due to the random motion of these particles at molecular length scales. However, diffusion in liquids has been found to couple with the flow of the fluid itself. This can lead to random concentration fluctuations that were recently found to exist at the molecular length scale and up to orders of magnitude larger. While these fluctuations have been measured for three-dimensional (3D) fluids, in the constrained dimensions of a two-dimensional (2D) fluid like a bio-membrane, they may be much larger still. Using ultra-thin freely-suspended liquid crystal films and molecular monolayers deposited on the surface of water, the research team aims to quantify these fluctuations within 2D fluids during diffusion and explore their effects on molecular transport. At the same time, the theory group is developing a mathematical model for these fluctuations and running computer simulations that can mimic experiments. This work contributes to an improved understanding of colossal fluctuations during diffusion and informs their importance in bio-membranes. The collaboration with the Soft Materials Research Center at the University of Colorado Boulder provides additional opportunities for the team of undergraduate research students to work at the frontiers of materials science and launch their post graduate careers.

Technical Abstract:
Diffusion of particles in bio-membranes plays an essential role in biochemical processes in living organisms. The concept of diffusion has recently received renewed attention with the discovery of giant concentration fluctuations (of spatial extent approaching 10,000 times molecular length scales) that develop during diffusive mixing of three-dimensional (3D) fluids in the presence of a concentration gradient. The concentration fluctuations are expected to be even larger in two-dimensional (2D) fluids due to the larger spatial extent of hydrodynamic interactions between diffusing particles. Bio-membranes can be modeled as quasi-2D fluids, having a combination of 2D and 3D hydrodynamic features due to the presence of a bulk fluid embedding the membrane. This project studies experimentally and theoretically the spatial and temporal extent of out-of-equilibrium concentration fluctuations, the crossover from 2D to 3D behavior, and the effects of fluctuations on the aggregation rate of diffusing particles in freely suspended smectic films, a model quasi-2D fluid.  The research team is using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) of dye dissolved in the film, and a miscibility phase transition in films of a binary liquid crystal mixture as well as in a dye-doped lipid Langmuir monolayer, to measure the concentration correlation function through the crossover from 2D to 3D behavior. The theory component of the project involves performing analytic calculations and running computer simulations, based on the immersed boundary method and stochastic hydrodynamics and using initial concentration distributions characteristic of the experiments, in order to generate a comparison to the observed concentration correlation functions. The education component of the project integrates training for undergraduate students, with a particular focus on recruiting under-represented groups, to help students in future positions at industrial and academic institutions.

"Non-technical abstract: 

Mineralized tissues are sophisticated organic-inorganic composites that are assembled bottom-up and exhibit hierarchical architecture. Highly evolved design enables features such as high bone toughness at low weight, self-sharpening teeth, and continuous adaptive remodeling/self-repair. The arrangement of the cellular components of the sea urchin tooth allows continuous growth and regeneration, in response to tooth wear and abrasion during feeding. From a materials perspective, the sea urchin tooth is highly unusual in that it is the only known instance of very high magnesium calcite (VHMC) in the columns that connect the primary and secondary plates to each other. With up to 33% Mg, VHMC is far from equilibrium, much harder than calcite, and cannot be made in the lab. The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism of formation of VHMC in the sea urchin tooth. The PI previously isolated a set of four proline-alanine rich acidic phosphoproteins (PARPs) that are unique to the tooth biomineral. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that PARPs are involved in VHMC formation. The main objective of the proposed work is to test this hypothesis by a) mapping the distribution of PARPs in the tooth in relation to the columns using immunohistochemistry; b) quantifying the impact of recombinant PARPs on nucleation, growth, and final composition of crystalline calcium carbonate in the presence of magnesium in vitro; and finally, by c) determining the impact of knock down of the most promising candidate in vivo. Poised at the intersection of molecular biology, materials science, and bioengineering, this research has the potential to inform a wealth of new technologies, from bio-inspired and bio-enabled materials to materials for carbon dioxide sequestration. The team will leverage the interdisciplinary potential of this research to train high school, undergraduate, masters and a graduate student from a broad range of backgrounds. 

Technical abstract:

The proposed activities address gaps in the understanding of how living organisms control crystal growth processes, with the long-term objective to develop bio-inspired and bio-enabled materials. The arrangement of the cellular components of the sea urchin tooth allows continuous growth and regeneration, in response to tooth wear and abrasion during feeding. An intriguing aspect of the tooth architecture is the use of both high magnesium calcite in the plates (HMC, Ca1-xMgxCO3, where x ~ 0.13) and very high magnesium calcite (VHMC, x~0.33) in the inter-plate columns. While other mineralized tissues in the sea urchin are comprised of HMC, VHMC is unique to the tooth. VHMC composition is far from equilibrium and there is no known synthesis. The PI previously identified a set of proline-alanine rich acidic phosphoproteins (PARPs) that are unique to the tooth biomineral. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that PARPs are involved in VHMC formation. To test this hypothesis, all 4 PARPs will be recombinantly expressed in a system that will ensure appropriate post-translational modification (phosphorylation). Antibodies will be raised against all recombinant PARPs to determine, using immunohistochemistry, which of them, if any, co-localize with the inter-plate columns, but not the plates. The two most promising candidates will be chosen for in-vitro experiments to determine their impact on nucleation, growth and composition of calcium carbonate in the presence of Mg. Both fully and un-phosphorylated forms will be tested to establish the functional role of phosphorylation. Finally, based on the in-vitro crystallization results, the most promising candidate will be knocked down in the adult sea urchin (using in-vivo morpholinos) and its effect on the composition of the inter-plate columns determined. The results should provide a mechanistic basis for bioinspired synthesis of VHMC, and how the sea urchin synthesizes calcite with a composition very far from equilibrium, thereby improving the properties of the material, and the performance of the tooth dramatically. Elucidating the mechanism of VHMC formation will feed back into the fields of cell and development biology. Complementary to the proposed research objectives, the team will engage undergraduates, a masters and a graduate student in research, and host a high school intern through Northwestern University's Science in Society program.

"Nontechnical Description:
The BioPACIFIC MIP (BioPolymers, Automated Cellular Infrastructure, Flow, and Integrated Chemistry: Materials Innovation Platform), located at the University of California's (UC) Santa Barbara and Los Angeles campuses, is a research platform dedicated to exploiting yeast, fungi, and bacteria as biological factories to generate building blocks in order to make polymeric materials (plastics) with superior properties to existing materials. Robotic automation is used to quickly prepare the bio-derived polymer materials, these materials are incorporated into higher order structures using advanced 3D printers, and cutting-edge characterization tools are used to determine how structure and organization at the atomic and molecular level affect materials properties. Dedicated and broadly accessible databases record properties and processing information from these tools, which are integrated with computer modeling and machine learning to help close the design loop and optimize these plastics derived from living organisms, in alignment with the methodology of the Materials Genome Initiative. Together these state-of-the-art tools in a national user facility, combined with world-class services, allow users and in-house researchers to accelerate the discovery and development of new materials with performances exceeding those of materials produced through traditional petrochemical-based methods. The BioPACIFIC MIP is a scientific ecosystem with researchers coming from materials science, biology, chemistry, and engineering, where researchers share tools, samples, data, software, and know-how for the collective advancement of science and technology. Through in-person interaction with expert staff and at an annual technical workshop, the BioPACIFIC MIP also educates and trains researchers, especially facility users and potential users, in automated synthetic biology, chemical synthesis, and advanced biomaterials characterization, while promoting diversity and inclusion at all organizational levels and in all aspects of operation.

Technical Description:
The discovery and development of advanced biomaterials with novel properties is the central focus of the BioPACIFIC MIP. This goal is realized through tight integration of synthesis, and physiochemical characterization of tactic, sequence-controlled, or stimuli-responsive polymers constructed from libraries of chiral, regioselective, and functional bio-sourced monomers in a feedback loop with simulation. The automated, high-throughput Living Bioreactor Platform at UC Los Angeles produces monomers with stereospecific functional groups from yeast, fungi, and bacteria that feed into a Materials Genome Initiative-based loop of hierarchical computation, automated polymerization, and flow chemistry at UC Santa Barbara. Cutting-edge materials characterization tools include a cryogenic microcrystal electron diffraction system that enables rapid determination of the structures of the building blocks and polymers in both two and three dimensions as well as x-ray scattering and high-throughput micro-rheology. Integrated state-of-the-art simulation tools are used to predict the properties of synthesized materials and systematically explore the design landscape of new chiral, regioselective, and functional bio-sourced monomers. Taken together, the BioPACIFIC MIP provides in-house researchers and facility users the unique opportunity to determine structure-property relationships that serve to guide molecular-level engineering and chemical formulation toward specific materials targets and provides insight into how natural, bio-based materials assemble and function.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves enabling widespread implementation of renewable but intermittent energy sources, such as wind and solar. Electrical grids currently require demand and supply of electricity to be exactly balanced in real time to avoid power disruption and blackouts. This is a challenging task, and growing efforts to integrate intermittent renewable energy sources create additional problems for grid resilience and energy security. Large-scale energy storage integrated into an electrical grid enables utility companies to effectively manage unwanted fluctuations and provides the flexibility required for widespread implementation of renewable sources. Furthermore, these systems have additional benefits in their utilization for peak shaving and load leveling applications. The energy stored when demand is low can be used to compensate excessive load during peaks. This practice has economic benefit for electricity consumers and providers.

This I-Corps project explores commercial application opportunities for high-stability, bio-inspired non-aqueous redox flow battery (NRFB) systems with high cell-voltage, high current density and low capacity-fade for the grid-scale energy storage market. State-of-the-art NRFB systems are limited by decomposition of active materials and the related significant capacity-fade after minimal cycling. The flow battery electrolytes we plan to commercialize solve the problem of active material instability that has prevented commercialization of NFRBs by utilizing metal chelators, the biosynthesis of which evolved naturally by mushrooms in the Amanita genus. These molecules have been optimized for stability by millions of generations of natural selection and exhibit very strong metal-binding that shuts down decomposition pathways. Preliminary results have shown that the introduced bio-inspired approach has the potential to address the critical problems, such as low cyclability and poor performance in commercialization of NRFB systems.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in lighter and stronger polymer composite materials with partial sustainability. 'Light and strong' features are essential to polymer composites.  These composites have demonstrated their effectiveness in the automobile industry from improved engine efficiency, low fuel consumption, reduction in the emission of CO2 and increased safety. The enhanced properties of our polymer nanocomposite materials including lighter weight, higher strength, and partial sustainability in combination with cost-effectiveness is of interest to the current composite industry and will benefit a wide range of industrial sectors such as aerospace, automotive, sports, defense, construction, packaging, electrical & electronics, biomedical etc. There is a growing market in polymer nanocomposites. The global polymer nanocomposite market will reach $11.5 billion by 2022 according to new research published by Allied Market Research.

This I-Corps project is based on developing polymer composite materials with nanoscale reinforcing fillers as well as a partially sustainable polymer matrix. Compared to traditional polymer composite materials, benefits of nanofiller come from their significantly higher specific surface area and concurrently enormous interfacial area. Surface modification of nanofillers will be carried out to efficiently stabilize the dispersion of nanofillers in the polymer matrix, substantially strengthen interfacial bonding between nanofillers and the polymer matrix, and consequently improve mechanical performance of the polymer nanocomposites, which brings in great potential for even lighter and stronger materials. In the meantime, environmentally friendly  bio-based binders will be developed to not only replace conventional surface coupling agents to surface-modify nanofillers, but also to partially replace the conventional polymer matrix to enhance the sustainability and mechanical performance of the resultant polymer composite materials.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR project proposing a novel broad spectrum insecticide safe for humans, expected to be safer than synthetic insecticides.  It will be used in conventional and organic farming, as well as personal protection/mosquito repellent products, costing significantly less than the products currently on the market. Crop losses due to insect pests cost billions of dollars and the limited classes of insecticides are vulnerable to the constant threat of resistance.  In addition, the lack of specificity creates broad risks due to pesticide residues polluting food and water and causing environmental damage. In particular, organic farming needs effective bioinsecticides for economically sustainable yields. The proposed product will have applications to other mosquito-borne diseases without adverse effects on human health.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to combine an effective insect protein target with a new class of molecules. In particular, a single molecule and its analogs derived from easily produced and cheaply priced natural products create new options for cost-effective and scalable de-novo synthesis for mass production. A few separate molecules from this general class have been shown to possess the right mechanism of insecticidal activity specific to insects (not humans). The specific protein target has a well conserved active site across arthropods (insects).

This SBIR Phase I project advances the manufacturing of biologics, which starts with a high performing clonal cell line derived (by definition) from a single cell. Developing such a cell line today takes up to 6 months due to iterative screening and testing to assure quality and performance.

The total addressable market includes 3 similar diols: 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO), 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO), and 1,6-hexanediol (1,6-HDO). In this project, 1,5-PDO is produced from furfural, a chemical made from renewable agricultural residues such as corn cobs and wood chips.  Bio-based 1,5-PDO can be readily substituted for 1,6-HDO in many applications due to its analogous molecular structure and is similar enough to 1,4-BDO that it can be substituted for it in some applications. Rigorous technoeconomic analysis shows that this ""green"" 1,5-PDO can be made at 3x lower costs than oil-derived 1,5-PDO, opening new opportunities for its use as a renewable monomer for paints, coatings, adhesives and plastics.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will allow the technology to be developed with commercially available fixed bed pellet catalysts to prepare the technology for scale-up.  Thus far, the technology has been demonstrated in small scale fixed bed reactors with powder catalysts.  A commercial scale process requires the use of pelletized catalysts due to inoperable pressure drops over powder catalysts in commercial-scale reactors. The higher flowrates inherent with larger scale reactors cannot flow through the tightly packed powder catalysts and cause a large degree of backpressure upstream of the catalyst bed; thus, pelletized catalysts must be sourced from commercial vendors and tested for activity and stability prior to scaling.  The next phase in technology development is to scale up the process by >100x, enabling testing and validation of larger amounts of the bio-based 1,5-PDO product in potential customers' product lines.  This SBIR Phase I project will also allow completion of the process design work needed to estimate the economics at commercial scale.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to commercialize a novel fermentation technology offering a sustainable solution for dairy industry waste issues. The system is initially focused on upcycling acid whey waste from Greek yogurt production into treated water and natural food-grade bio-oils that are sustainable alternatives for chemicals sourced from palm oil. These systems will be installed on-site at yogurt plants and are expected to lower customer expenses by at least 20%, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption by 90%. This pilot project will inform treatment of other problematic wastes, such as process line cleaning water and manure, as well as milk and cheese processing byproducts. The bio-oils produced this way could serve as animal feed and as drop-in alternatives for biofuels. 

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to optimize the system design of a novel fermentation technology.  Evaluations are focused on upcycling acid whey waste from Greek yogurt production into treated water and bio-oil.  Project objectives include: 1) bench-scale evaluations on bioreactor architecture and operating parameters, such as internal packing materials, gas dosing flowrates, and pH control; 2) bench-scale mass transfer optimizations performed on the current bio-oil extraction architecture, as well as on a novel membrane-less alternative. Results from bench-scale studies will inform process design and construction of a 2,000-gallon demonstration system installed at a Greek yogurt plant, where parallel bioprocesses will systematically evaluate operational parameters (temperature,  pH, flow) at a larger scale to explore the trade space of acid whey treatment,  production of bio-oil, and operating cost and optimize the operating parameters.

PART 1:  NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY
 
Emulsions are suspensions of two immiscible liquids, which are ubiquitously utilized across many industries for diverse applications. The research goal of this CAREER project is to synthesize biomaterial-based water-in-water emulsions using a process inspired by natural cell biology. Cells create such emulsions by leveraging phase separation of their intracellular proteins and have developed capabilities to tailor the properties of these emulsions by modifying the phase separating proteins using a diverse palette of chemical reactions. Our understanding of how these modifications stabilize or tailor the water-water interfaces remains incomplete, which increases our reliance on traditional oil-based emulsions. To address this challenge and advance the field of biomaterial design, this research uses a combination of genetic and chemical manipulation to synthesize and study phase-separating proteins with customizable modification patterns. The size and stability of resulting emulsions will be characterized and will be correlated to the modification patterns. The knowledge gained from these studies will be used to create water-in-water emulsions that can be precisely controlled to have user-defined characteristics. Due to their biocompatibility, such new water-in-water emulsions have great potential to replace traditional oil-based emulsions in food processing, cosmetics, biosensing, and delivery of pharmaceuticals. This project will provide the materials science community with innovative and easy-to-use platforms for scalable synthesis of biomaterials and help accelerate the ability to manufacture the next generation of structurally complex, functionally tunable biomaterials for multiple industrial and healthcare applications. This will strengthen the U.S.'s leadership in the global bioeconomy. 
Educational activities supported through this project will train the next generation of scientists and engineers in bio-enabled technologies. A major educational activity is the student creation of biodegradable and eco-friendly materials for fabric and textile applications. Applications of this work can address the highly polluting and environmentally damaging current practices in textile manufacturing. This educational activity will be used in outreach to attract and engage high school students to this merger of science and design. In addition, this project will inform the redesign of an undergraduate and graduate laboratory course that will involve students in real-world discovery and will train students in the regulatory framework used in the biotechnology industry.
 
PART 2:  TECHNICAL SUMMARY
 
This CAREER project will exploit the bio-enabled process of post-translational modification (PTM) to advance the goal of rationally designing hybrid biomaterials with functionality that exceeds the capabilities of natural biopolymers. The study will decrypt the material-design principles of phase-separating lipidated proteins (PLPs) to create water-in-water emulsions with user-defined formation, fluid properties, and internal structure. The study will investigate the overarching hypothesis that the physicochemical interplay between the protein, lipid, and lipidation site domains regulates the strength and half-life of adhesive and cohesive interactions that control the formation, viscoelasticity, and hierarchical organization of PLP condensates. Three research objectives will elucidate the molecular and thermodynamically grounded descriptions of how lipidation PTM alters the interfacial and rheological characteristics of model protein condensates: (1) correlate the thermodynamic stability of PLP emulsions to the physicochemistry of lipid and phase-separating proteins, (2) ascertain the effect of lipidation site sequence on the dynamics of cohesive interactions and colloidal properties of biphasic PLP emulsions, and (3) determine the molecular factors that regulate the strength of adhesive microscopic interactions and macroscopic miscibility of multiphasic PLP emulsions. Methods to achieve these objectives include bio-/semi-synthesis of PLPs to create libraries with systematically varied lipid, protein, and lipidation sites; determination of phase boundaries using light scattering techniques; and characterization of dynamic material properties of PLP droplets using microscopy and phase-separated states using rheology. Multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance techniques will be used to investigate the defining structural and dynamic elements of PLPs to enable the rational design of the next generation of condensates with tailorable structural and material properties. The education plan integrates these research efforts into a multitiered approach to (1) increase the public's awareness of bio-enabled materials and technologies as solutions to societally relevant problems, (2) recruit underrepresented minorities from nontraditional backgrounds to biomaterials research, and (3) enhance biomaterials education at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant focuses on research in the manufacturing of bio-inspired metal-graphene composites that have both high strength and high toughness. Due to their light weight and high strength, metal matrix composites are increasingly used in automotive, aerospace, electronics packaging and thermal management applications. Attaining both high strength and high toughness is an essential requirement for many structural applications. However, it is a significant challenge for metal matrix composites to have both. Nature-evolved, damage-tolerant materials such as nacre, bone and wood are both strong and tough because of their hierarchical composite structure. Unlike bone and wood, which have complex microstructures, nacre exhibits superior mechanical properties with a simple composite microstructure. The toughness of nacre is three orders of magnitude higher than that of its main constituent aragonite owing to its hierarchical “brick-and-mortar” microstructure. This project investigates a novel manufacturing technique to engineer nacre- or bio-inspired three-dimensional metal-graphene composites. This research develops computational and experimental capabilities to understand the strengthening and toughening mechanisms in these materials. This project greatly impacts the metal matrix composites industry. The research is complemented by an educational and outreach program involving curriculum development, research training and engaging K-12 students and the general public. 

The goal of this research is to manufacture next-generation, damage-tolerant metal matrix composites for mission-critical applications. The research plan is to understand the evolution of the “brick-and-mortar” microstructure in three-dimensional metal-graphene composites as a function of manufacturing process parameters. The fabrication of the “brick-and-mortar” structure involves assembling sucrose-coated copper platelets in a three-dimensional structure, converting sucrose into a graphene network by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and consolidating the assembly by hot pressing into a composite. An objective of this project is to study the strengthening and toughening mechanisms of strain hardening, deformation twinning, crack deflection and crack bridging as functions of the “brick-and-mortar” microstructure, i.e., copper platelet diameter and thickness, and thickness of the continuous graphene film. The fundamental understanding of the strengthening and toughening mechanisms through molecular dynamics simulations and mechanical testing guides the manufacture of nacre-inspired metal-graphene composite structures. The correlation between processing, microstructure and properties establishes the rational design of the metal-matrix manufacturing process. The bio-inspired composite manufacturing technique can be extended to other metal-graphene composites, e.g., using aluminum, magnesium, nickel, titanium, and their alloys as metal matrices. This project allows the PI to advance the knowledge base in computational modeling and metal matrix composites and establishes his long-term career in advanced manufacturing.

"This Research Coordination Network is a response to two problems in biology education: 1) There are often glaring mismatches between what biology faculty and other STEM instructors state as their course goals and the assessments students take; and 2) The lack of regional and local opportunities prevent many faculty at under-resourced institutions, which disproportionally serve students underrepresented in STEM, from engaging in professional development. The Advancing assessment SKills in BIOlogy (ASK BIO) Network will address these issues in two ways. First, the network will design and implement faculty development workshops intended for faculty at under-resourced institutions on how to write machine-gradable assessment questions that present a high level of cognitive challenge and that are aligned with learning outcomes inspired by the ""Vision and Change"" report. Second, the network will provide communities of practice for participants with which they can remain engaged.

Aligning assessments with learning objectives is a basic element of good course design. In introductory biology courses across the country, exam questions--what students get graded on--and course goals are commonly mismatched: instructors who embrace the unifying conceptual frameworks outlined in the ""Vision and Change"" report and the competencies-based focus of the ""Training Future Physicians"" document often give exams that predominantly test recall or low-level conceptual understanding. This project focuses on the often-neglected skill of writing exam questions that ask students to apply, analyze, synthesize, or interpret information in addition to just recalling it and will develop regional communities of practice to help faculty with skills development. ASK BIO will synergize with an ongoing effort by the BioInteractive group at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), which is developing a freely accessible online database of high-level, machine-gradable questions for introductory biology.

This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in ""Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action"" (http://visionandchange/finalreport) with additional support provided by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"Title: CAREER: Bio-inspired design methods for distributed electromechanical actuators

Abstract: The project objective is to create a class of modular and distributed electromechanical actuators and their power network that will enable robots to be agile, efficient, and capable of reproducing biological motions that today are impossible. Animals have the innate capability to move and maneuver effectively in complex and unstructured environments. Recent advances in bio-inspired robots have conceptualized collaborative robots or ""cobots"", which will interact with humans in multiple settings. Although state-of-the-art bio-inspired robots have achieved exquisite maneuvers, such systems have yet to closely replicate the grace, fluidity, and agility of their biological counterparts.  There is a critical need to re-imagine these robots not only as an embodiment of mechanical linkages and artificial intelligence but also as a complex network of electromechanical actuators. The project aims to emulate a biological spine. A distributed actuator mimicking the spine mechanism will improve mobility, efficiency, and stability of robots in search, rescue, and recovery making them the first line of defense for disaster relief as well as surveillance reconnaissance, inspection, and exploration applications. The proposed research trajectory will catapult hardware advances in these robots to converge with the exploding capability of artificial intelligence and autonomous control, saving human lives and enhancing national security. Further, an active synthetic spine opens up opportunities to design a life-like exoskeleton, arrest spine deformities in children, augment upper-body rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients, perform whole-body robotic teleoperation, and add non-verbal capability in social robots. The integrated education and outreach plan aims to ignite curiosity in K-12 students about electromechanics and power electronics--foundations of our modern civilization--by using robotics as the catalyst.

A spine is fundamental to providing flexibility and balance in animals while allowing efficient locomotion. Construction of a synthetic spine is remarkably different from other standard robotic mechanisms, such as arms and legs, due to the presence of multiple single-joint segments, each with a limited range of motion. The design strategy will take advantage of the limited displacement requirement to increase the actuator's torque-to-weight ratio. Instead of employing conventional electric motors that utilizes shear stress to generate motion, the proposed gearless design will use normal stress. Integrated design of mechanical springs and electromagnetics will enable a customized torque-displacement characteristic to achieve compliance and high efficiency--similar to muscles. Deployment of appropriate control and estimation techniques is proposed to vary output torque and compliance. The design methodology will be validated by constructing a hardware prototype of a synthetic spine. The project plans to construct demonstration kits using research results that connect math and theory to the craft of real-world systems such as robots and automated systems. These demo kits will attract and inspire K-12 students, underrepresented groups, and a broader audience about electrical power and energy processing. The demo kits blueprint will also be shared with K-12 educators to help them teach their STEM clubs. In summary, the proposed framework is the basis to build a multi-disciplinary understanding of distributed actuators and their power network in robots and automated systems and to advance the robotics workforce through educational pathways.

"Advances in assistive devices that enable individuals with leg amputations to walk, e.g., robotic prosthesis, orthoses and exoskeletons, have been considerable in recent years.  However, existing systems have trouble operating in dynamic, real-world environments that include unexpected disturbances. Thus, the goal of this CAREER project is to address the need for assistive robots that can naturally respond to disturbances by exploiting the underlying dynamics of human locomotion, i.e., by providing the device, in real time, with the same abilities to change joint stiffness and damping properties that humans unknowingly regulate through muscle activations. The key idea is to understand how the nervous system regulates leg joint stiffness and resistance throughout walking, and use this information for a new, bio-inspired blueprint for design and control of assistive robotics. This project will also provide insight into how the human body responds to disturbances. The results from this project will significantly improve quality of life and productivity for over a million lower-limb amputees in the U.S. alone. Throughout the project, the integration of research and education will have broad impact through the 1) promotion of STEM and disability awareness to K-12 students through targeted events that showcase the formal and ""maker"" sides of engineering, 2) implementation of interdisciplinary mechanisms for knowledge transfer between engineering students and clinicians, and 3) sponsorship and mentoring of student senior design projects that directly support this research through co-oversight with clinicians.

The principal investigator's long-term research goal is to advance a transformative approach to the design and control of assistive robots that embrace and exploit the underlying dynamics of human locomotion. Towards this goal, this project will measure the mechanical impedance of the knee joint during walking and use the information obtained to develop a new generation of bio-inspired control systems that will enable users of assistive robots to move more freely in dynamic environments that include unexpected disturbances.  Studies will make use of assistive devices already developed or under development in the principal investigator's lab: a torque-controllable exoskeleton for the knee and an Open-Source Robotic Leg prosthesis (OSL, developed under an NSF award) that has powered knee-ankle joints.  The Research Plan is organized under three aims.   The FIRST AIM is to investigate techniques for measuring knee mechanical impedance using the torque-controllable exoskeleton, which will be quantified in able-bodied subjects during walking.  Methodologies will be validated in a passive mechanical system of springs and masses for which impedances are known before involving human subjects. Data that can be used to determine mechanical impedance of the knee during locomotion will be recorded from human subjects wearing the knee exoskeleton while walking on a split-belt treadmill in which small perturbations (e.g. increased ramp angle) can be applied and response torques measured by the exoskeleton.  Perturbations will be applied such that a snapshot of impedance can be obtained at each point during the gait cycle.  Point impedances will be quantified by fitting inertia, stiffness and damping parameters to a second-order differential equation.  The SECOND AIM is to derive governing equations for bio-inspired impedance control of the leg that will be implemented in an open-source library for control of the OSL.  The results obtained under Aim 1 will be synthesized with preliminary work estimating the impedance of the ankle to derive a unified control law that enables simultaneous regulation of knee-ankle kinetics, kinematics and mechanical impedance.  The governing equations will be translated into a software library that is able to command the OSL and enables real-time control of knee-ankle impedance, i.e., stiffness, damping and equilibrium position parameters will be altered as a function of gait phase and, thus, not predisposed to a single speed.  The ability of the OSL to achieve the desired stiffness and dampening coefficients will be validated in a benchtop testing setup.  The THIRD AIM is to understand the effect of the impedance-based control system in above-knee amputees using the OSL, tested during ambulation with/without disturbances.  Subjects will be studied while ground walking at a self-selected pace with both the impedance-controlled system and each person's prescribed prosthesis. A subsequent study will investigate the effect of disturbances while subjects are walking on an instrumented treadmill.  Kinetics, kinematics, metabolics and stability measures across conditions will be compared to better understand how the bio-inspired control approach affects amputee mobility and how these measures compare to able-body mechanics.  Though several disturbances will be applied, this project will focus on understanding the effect of walking on inclines and declines.

"Biological flyers such as insects and birds represent an engineering marvel in terms of their natural maneuvering capabilities. These exhibited biological phenomena offer a scientifically-rich gold mine for problems. The astounding maneuvering performance exhibited by these flyers is a result of complex dynamic interaction that takes place between their flapping wings and the aerodynamics resulting from fluid flow over their bodies.  Some insects have been observed to perform turning maneuvers of greater than 3000 deg/s, with less than a 30 ms delay. In normal everyday flight, some birds may experience up to 14 g accelerations in super-maneuverable tasks, while the maneuverability of the most advanced fighter airplanes cannot exceed 8-9 g. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will focus on understanding the fundamental aspects and mechanisms of the dynamic interaction between the wing-body and fluid dynamics during flight. The results from the proposed research will enable engineers to design bio-inspired micro-air-vehicles without complicated sensory-control-actuator-processing systems by promoting self (natural) stabilization. The proposed research will boost the design capabilities of micro-air-vehicles and drones, which have great potential use in search and rescue missions, reconnaissance missions, filming, border monitoring, emergency response, etc. It is a multi-disciplinary work that bridges the gap between mathematics, physics, engineering, and biomechanics. The project will also lead to the development of new courses for students and interesting program that focuses on improving participation of minority students in STEM disciplines.  

The primary objective of this proposal is to investigate the interactions between the wing-body dynamics and unsteady flow dynamics in flapping flight with particular emphasis on the underpinning physics of the newly discovered vibrational stabilization phenomenon. This will be achieved by a three-prong approach: (i) Theoretical: by developing a reduced-order flight dynamic model and analyzing the aerodynamics-body-wing-dynamics interactions using geometric control theory and higher-order averaging; (ii) Computational: by solving Navier-Stokes equations around the wings of a flapping insect, coupled with the mechanical equations governing the wing and body motion to study the role of leading and trailing edge vortices in the vibrational stabilization phenomenon; and (iii) Experimental: by building a multi degree-of-freedom test bed (with motion capture and flow visualization) to validate the theoretical and computational findings and experimentally assess the effectiveness of vibrational stabilization in flapping flight and scrutinize its physics. Finally, a new generation of flapping micro-air-vehicles will be developed with minimal actuation, relying on the discovered vibrational stabilization phenomenon.

"Biology uses reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions (reactions in which a reactant in a chemical reaction gains one or more electrons) to perform important functions: energy harvesting (respiration); biosynthesis (production of a chemical compound by a living organism); defense (inflammation); and communication (redox signaling). The investigators' unique insight is that the electrical features of this redox modality--the ""flow"" of electrons through redox reactions--is accessible through simple electrode-based instrumentation and that applications can be developed to both observe (sense) and intervene-in (actuate) biological systems. The research team plans to develop the fundamental theories and methods needed to build and characterize a materials-interface for the ""redox-based translation"" between the molecular language of biology and the electrical language of modern devices. The investigators envision that redox-linked bioelectronics will enable a new generation of bioelectronic applications for medicine (e.g., for point-of-care diagnosis), commerce (e.g., wearable electronics), and the environment (e.g., remote sensing). Through this project the investigators will continue nurturing their research ecosystem that: (i) crosses disciplines and spans the globe; (ii) generates new theories/methods and iteratively accelerates their testing through diverse collaborations with problem-focused researchers; (iii) leverages contributions from basic and applied scientists/engineers from government, academia and the private sector; and (iv) disseminates these advances through individualized training (e.g., of graduate, undergraduate and high school researchers as well as teacher-training summer programs), integration into undergraduate curricula (at the community college, undergraduate college and minority serving university levels), and transfer to the public (by hosting specialized technical conferences and generating videos for the general public).

The long-term vision of this project is to fuse the orthogonal information processing capabilities of biology and electronics through redox-linked bioelectronics.  The focus of this project is on a subset of problems involving communication through a redox-signaling modality that is used by the immune system for inflammation and wound healing.  The Research Plan is organized under three objectives.  The FIRST objective is ""Electro-bio-fabrication to Build the Bio-Device Interface."" Hydrogel-based interfaces (i.e., films) will be created using an iterative approach that ""teaches"" how electrical signals can guide the emergence of complex structure from self-assembling polysaccharides (chitosans).  The investigators propose to optimize the chitosan-based fabrication by controlling the local electrical field, salt concentration and electrostatic crosslinking. Advanced computational simulation and machine-learning will be implemented to gain mechanistic understanding of the fabrication process.  The ability to controllably organize and reconfigure bio-based soft matter will enable the creation of adaptive, compatible, high-performance and sustainable materials systems for a range of life science applications. The SECOND Objective is ""Electrochemistry to Discover and Characterize Materials."" Novel electrochemical methods will be used for the automated, adaptive and ultimately autonomous discovery and characterization of materials that can control the transport (i.e., flow) of electrons and molecules. The simplicity, speed and data-richness of redox-based electrochemical measurements facilitates coupling to machine learning, and these capabilities could shift the paradigm for ""chemical information"" from a chemistry perspective (composition and concentration) to an information theory perspective. Such a paradigm shift could both improve reliability and facilitate translation for point-of-care and wearable electronics.  The THIRD Objective is ""Redox to Link Bio-electronic Communication."" Test bed demonstrations will integrate activities across objectives. Synthetic biology constructs will be generated as observable ""information processors"" for a microfluidic gut-on-a-chip model of the microbiome. The immediate goal is to demonstrate that these multilayer films allow a bi-directional ""flow"" of molecularly-based redox information.  These test bed studies are expected to  provide the technical knowledge needed to build devices (e.g., capsular endoscopy systems) that can survey a redox environment and contribute to sculpting this environment.

"Ceramics and brittle polymers play a pivotal role in biomedical, automotive, and aerospace applications. Their catastrophic failure when undergoing thermal and mechanical stresses is a concern. In contrast, although marine spicules are also made of a brittle ceramic (silica), they show unusual toughness and flexibility due to their nested cylindrical structure. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will initially focus on investigating the microstructure, micromechanical properties, and crack development patterns and mechanisms in marine spicules found in a marine sponge, Euplectella aspergillum. The research findings will be subsequently used to design and fabricate similar structures from brittle materials such as rigid polymers and ceramics and explore their potential for bone tissue engineering and other applications. As part of the project, research will be integrated in the curriculum to train next-generation engineers. Undergraduate and graduate underrepresented minority and female students will be recruited into the research effort. There will be summer programs and workshops for K-12 students to learn about additive manufacturing. Lastly, high school teachers will be invited to summer research programs and industrial connections will be strengthened through collaborative research.  
 
The objective of this research is to investigate the role of architecture in the facture behavior of bio-inspired nested cylindrical structures made of brittle materials. The inspiration comes from marine spicules composed of silica that resist the propagation of cracks due to the layered structure. The plan is to mimic and engineer similar structures with lower weight and improved fracture performance. First, a combination of scanning electron microscopy and finite element modeling will be used to extensively examine the toughening effect of various geometrical configurations, roughness, and morphology of the surface of cylinders and materials properties of marine spicules. These findings will form the basis of various spicule-inspired structural configurations made of tough polymers and ceramics, which will be fabricated with stereolithography 3D printing processes. An extensive experimental program based on the Taguchi method and finite element analysis will be used to understand the operative deformation mechanisms. Lastly, the analysis of variance will be performed to find the critical parameters most affecting the fracture behavior.

"Metal oxide nanoparticles coupled with metal-reducing bacteria can generate reaction processes for applications in bio-remediation of contaminated soil and water. The challenge is to increase the currently low efficiency of these reactions, which critically depend on how nanoparticles interact with the outer membrane proteins. This CAREER project will investigate iron oxide nanoparticle-protein electron transfer reaction for the purpose of developing more efficient technologies for environmental applications. The knowledge obtained from this project is also highly desirable and applicable to technology development in bioenergy, biocompatible materials and biosensors. This research will greatly impact the scientific exploration in many disciplines, including chemical and biomedical engineering, material science, chemistry and biology. Through targeted efforts that integrate research and education, this project will provide cutting-edge research opportunities to promote STEM education for undergraduate and graduate students, particularly those from underrepresented communities, and will offer education activities to broaden STEM experiences for K-12 teachers and students as well as for the general public.

The overall research goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanism of iron oxide nanoparticle-protein electron transfer and redox, which is greatly needed for environmental applications utilizing coupled iron oxide nanoparticle-dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria. Due to the lack of a proper simulation approach and parameters for nano-bio systems, there are few synergistic theoretical studies in this area. To tackle computational challenges at multiscale levels, involving protein conformation changes, chemical reactions and electron transfer, this project will incorporate multiscale simulations at the quantum, atomistic and molecular levels, complemented by experiments of cyclic voltammogram and linear and nonlinear vibrational spectroscopies as well as virtual visualization. Simulation parameters of electron transfer and nanoparticle-protein interactions and reactions will be developed based on theory and quantum computations. The underlying mechanism of the abiotic-biotic interfacial electron transfer and the associated molecular details of nanoparticle-protein's physical interactions and chemical reactions at multiscales will be investigated. The effects of lipopolysaccharide, phospholipids, outer membrane and properties of nanoparticles on protein interfacial behavior and the interfacial electron transfer will be studied. The simulation results of nanoparticle properties, protein secondary structure, orientation on nanoparticle surfaces and electron transfer properties will be verified by experimental measurements. Simulations will also help interpret experimental cyclic voltammogram signals and linear and nonlinear vibrational spectra. This work will provide valuable insights into physics and chemistry regarding nano-bio interfacial phenomena and will promote the development of efficient bio-nano technologies. The educational goal of this project is to enhance STEM education for underrepresented minority students at university and K-12 levels by providing world-class engineering education and research opportunities. The research activities and results of this project will be incorporated into new courses and student research opportunities to recruit and retain minority students in STEM fields. This project will also offer STEM teacher workshops, introduce high school students to research projects, and promote the scientific literacy of the general public.

"The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the creation of a scalable platform technology to deliver new therapies and vaccines through manufacturing viral vectors. This sector has been hampered by inefficient manufacturing methods designed for small molecules 10,000 times less complex than the current effort. The technology developed herein will provide a durable competitive advantage by offering “plug and play,” broad compatibility, and improved productivity for virus manufacturing compared to existing industry solutions. The technology will improve yields, shorten manufacturing lead times, and accelerate time-to-market for potentially life-saving therapies and vaccines. This research project seeks to validate scalability and establish a production method to deliver quality reagents to developers of adenoviral vectors.  

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to advance a scalable downstream purification process for gene therapy vectors.  Viral vectors have remarkable utility as therapeutics and vaccines, but their impact has been plagued by downstream purification inefficiencies that lead to single digit yields.  The technology developed in this project will address this bottleneck using a polypeptide-based reagent that combines affinity-capture with phase separation and filtration equipment. The technology aims to improve capacity, step yield, final vector purity, and productivity. To validate the lead adenovirus reagent, a tangential flow filtration process will be optimized using harvests with a wide range of starting impurities and across various adenovirus serotypes to ensure a broadly compatible product. The reagent’s ability to stabilize adenovirus will be further explored toward an efficient and scalable filtration process. Finally, a method for reagent manufacturing will be developed to ensure consistent and low-cost supply. Completion of these objectives will yield a mature downstream process for one-step adenovirus purification, a manufacturing method that ensures sufficient quantity of quality reagents to support adenovirus clinical development, and rapidly deployable adenovirus vaccine manufacturing to meet future needs.

"The broader impact of this I-Corps project will be to enable bio-sensing earphones for personalized healthcare. It can benefit a wide range of systems and applications that require continuous and long-term personal monitoring, such as user behavior analysis, seizure suppression, sleep improvement, and personalized education. Currently, there are 3 billion people without access to healthcare who could potentially benefit from the device.  Mobile healthcare is rapidly growing, emerging industry in need of a socially acceptable, platform technology to enable healthcare applications outside the hospital. This project will directly support national level initiatives on improving healthcare practices and enhancing future workforce capability. To make the broadest impact possible, the project will initially focus on individual customers, to improve lives in ways that were technologically impossible before.   The potential innovation enables a mobile healthcare platform for everyday use with high accuracy, low cost, and high comfort to users.

This I-Corps project includes several innovations to enable previously impossible mobile physiological sensing. This ear-worn device enables everyday users to access the medically valuable physiological data from the human head in a comfortable, small, and wearable form factor placed in or around the ears. The project's algorithms, hardware, and software can infer the wearer's mental, physiological, and physical states from the ears. The resulting innovation enables immediate access to vital health information such as sleep deprivation, attention, and even seizure onset without using obtrusive, expensive hospital equipment. The team will evaluate the platform through customer discovery and other commercialization focused evaluations.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the use of special molecules known as peptides. The last twenty years have seen extensive academic research on bioactive and structural peptides for applications ranging from antimicrobials, vaccines, scaffolds for tissue engineering and drug delivery, growth factors for cell culture media, and bioactives for medical nutrition or the control of chronic diseases. However, despite their great potential, few have advanced to translation at scale, due in part to the prohibitive cost of peptide synthesis.  This project advances a peptide production system.

The proposed project aims to develop a recombinant technology platform that will dramatically decrease the cost of manufacturing of peptides beyond what is currently commercially feasible. It addresses peptide production from a different perspective than that of current recombinant peptide production technologies. Specifically, taking advantage of the fact that peptides can be treated as polymers rather than as folded proteins with a complex structure, novel microbial cell factories will enable the peptide production and purification.

"The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a safe and effective therapeutic for spinal fusion surgeries. Over 500,000 people undergo spinal fusion surgery in the U.S. every year to treat debilitating back and neck pain. Compared to harvesting bone from a donor site on the patient, spinal biologics are popular among surgeons because they offer a synthetic, off-the-shelf implant requiring a single surgical site and offering consistent clinical outcomes. However, safety concerns surrounding these therapeutics have limited its approval for use only to the lumbar region of the spine, and high manufacturing costs of recombinant proteins can be prohibitive for widespread adoption. This project advances a technology that is safer and less expensive than the currently used biologics in spinal surgeries.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops large-scale manufacturing methods for peptide amphiphile (PA) molecules, which self-assemble into supramolecular polymers that can reduce the dose of the biological necessary to achieve successful spinal fusion as demonstrated in preclinical large animal models. While highly promising, manufacturing supramolecular polymers at large scale presents challenges because supramolecular self-assembly is highly sensitive to processing steps and conditions. The project goal is to develop a scalable manufacturing method that results in PA assemblies with efficacy equivalent to PA assemblies produced in the research laboratory setting. To achieve this, PA molecules will be synthesized using industry-compatible methods to improve the scalability.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a proposed aerogel wound dressing that may help heal patients with chronic wounds. The total treatment cost for patients with chronic wounds could be reduced as they may heal faster but also possibly require fewer dressing changes eliminating the use of multiple dressings. Since the proposed technology is biodegradable, it is also possible that the technology makes the wound healing process more sustainable.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a class of novel bio-based aerogels for wound dressings, which could help address the current issues in chronic wound-healing today. Aerogels possess a unique combination of high porosity, high surface area, an abundance of mesopores, and capillary action that result in properties like high absorbance, gas exchange, and moisture balance at the wound interface which may create an incubator-like environment that possibly reduces the formation of biofilm and protects the wound from pathogens. Being bio-based the proposed technology may possess increased biocompatibility and biodegradability, as well as possibly providing the wound site with necessary proteins that may improve the healing process. Bio-based aerogel materials have absorbance capacities up to 50 times their weight compared with 7-8 times for popular commercial chronic wound dressings. The physicochemical properties of these materials may be useful for the wound healing environment.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project isto improve the outcomes for implant procedures for soft tissue healing. More than 2 million musculoskeletal repair surgeries are performed in the U.S. each year, representing a $5 B market. Instead of conventional 3D printing that completely melts or fuses synthetic biopolymers into solid and rigid objects, this project will develop a novel 3D microfiber printing process project to rapidly and economically produce clinical-grade printed implants with better performance.  This technology will offer a significant reduction in the cost of goods and a faster product development cycle. The novel implants will be available in markets wherein existing products are prohibitively expensive, including ambulatory surgical centers, wherein most of these surgical procedures are performed.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will progress the design and engineering for a novel 3D microfiber printer that can assemble clinically relevant synthetic biopolymer filaments into fibrous, flexible, high void/porosity implants to promote soft tissue healing. This approach offers improvements in quality, cost, speed, and manufacturability. This project will explore the material strength, cytocompatibility, and biocompatibility using industry-standard testing. Expected technical results include quantitative measures for a controlled fibrous 3D printing method compatible with diverse synthetic biopolymers and across clinical indications. This project will optimize the hardware engineering, polymer, and print configuration.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to help address the issue of non-bio degradable plastics polluting the planet through the development of biodegradable urethane monomers, formulations yielding industry standard performance metrics for their application.  There are 2,600 pounds of plastic trash accumulated for each living person today, with at least 18 billion pounds of plastic entering our oceans every year.  Sustainable products have yet to be commercialized at scale due to high cost and low quality.  We will change the urethane industry through the commercialization of high-performance biodegradable materials and development of high value consumer products.

This project proposes to address the lack of biologically based materials in consumer products by utilizing algae polyols, and their formulation chemistries, to develop and optimize appropriate bio-based formulations, specifically polyurethane foams, for consumer use as footwear.  The company will demonstrate biodegradability of the product.  The company will also develop the supply chain and associated processes for their algae raw materials to produce algae polyols at scale.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to improve manufacturing technology for the purification of monoclonal antibodies, which are important therapeutics as well as valuable tools in research and diagnostics. Approximately four new antibody drugs are approved every year, and while they can have tremendous clinical outcomes and are sometimes heralded as ""magic bullets,"" they often come with a significant price tag. This puts a strain on patients and insurance companies, limiting the accessibility of antibody-based drugs. Furthermore, antibodies are critical research tools that enhance the understanding of biology. The technology developed in this research project will provide a completely novel method for the purification of antibodies from cell culture that will lower cost, increase manufacturing throughput, and accelerate the time to market for new therapeutics. Commercially, this technology will disrupt the current gold standard - Protein A resin - making antibody purification simpler, faster, and cheaper at all scales: research, clinical, and industrial. 

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop technology for improved purification of monoclonal antibodies.  Although upstream production of antibodies in cell culture has improved dramatically, downstream purification has not kept pace, resulting in a production bottleneck and a major market opportunity. The objectives of this SBIR Phase I project are to demonstrate technical and commercial feasibility of a new technology that combines affinity with liquid-liquid phase separation to separate antibodies from cell culture contaminants. It involves an antibody-binding domain fused to a biopolymer with stimulus responsive phase behavior. When this fusion protein is added to cell culture harvest, it binds the antibody and, after triggering the phase separation with salt, pulls the antibody out of solution. The purified antibody can then be eluted from the fusion by lowering the pH. This project aims to 1) optimize regeneration conditions so that the fusion can be reused, 2) evaluate long-term stability, and 3) validate the technology at scale and conduct a head-to-head comparison to the industry gold standard, Protein A resin. The goal is to identify storage conditions that provide a long shelf life for a product that can be reused 10-100 times without compromising antibody yield or purity. The focus of the project is to demonstrate promising capabilities of the technology for use in industrially manufactured monoclonal antibodies, replacing conventional chromatography steps with a simpler and more cost-effective method.

"The broader impacts and commercial potentials of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project will significantly reduce the nitrogen fertilizer usage, thus reducing the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Overuse of nitrogen fertilizers leads to nutrient losses that contribute to climatic change that in turn negatively affects agricultural productivity and environmental health. This project creates a new nanofertilizer from underutilized biomass feedstocks and wastewater nutrient recovery.  Furthermore, this project trains future leaders in agricultural entrepreneurship and innovation management.

The proposed project advances a simple approach using nitric acid-sodium nitrite mixtures (both are key ingredients for N-fertilizer synthesis) that can extract nanocellulose directly from untreated non-woody plants (e.g. agricultural residues) with significant reduction of chemical, water and energy needs. This nitro-oxidation process (NOP) approach combines the steps of pulping and cellulose oxidation. In addition, the spent liquor in the process can be readily converted into plant fertilizer. Nanocellulose has been shown to be an effective scaffolding material to host a multitude of organic and inorganic nanoparticles and to create low-cost and environmentally friendly nanocomposite. The proposed activities will (1) demonstrate and evaluate the scale-up of NOP operation, involving process optimization, safety procedure development, efficient conversion of spent liquor and understanding of the structure-functionality-process relationships from various  non-woody biomass feedstocks, and (2) synthesize a new kind of nanocellulose-enabled bio-nanofertilizer, including ammonium-nanocellulose, ZnO nanoparticle-nanocellulose, and CuO nanoparticle-anchored nanocellulose composites. The proposed research will provide new knowledge for creating effective nanofertilizers and for overcoming technical hurdles to upcycle two major waste streams i.e., underutilized biomass, and excess N-nutrients in wastewater.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has undermined national capacity to offer onsite Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites. Due to the rapid onset of the pandemic, BIO-REU principal investigators (PIs) were caught largely unprepared to deliver REU learning through distance technologies. This proposal will capitalize of the organizing activities started by BIO-REU PIs to provide distance REU programs. Specifically, PIs are making substantial changes to their programs to engage students in research at a distance, including shifting to research projects that can be conducted at a distance, offering research mentoring and professional development online, and providing informal avenues for communication at a distance. The shift to distance programming is both necessary and unprecedented. Substantive evaluation is needed in order to refine these approaches to maximize student learning and minimize disruption to REU offerings, which play a critical role in developing the research workforce. This project will improve student learning and development in distance BIO-REU sites by carrying out such an evaluation. First, the distance REUs will be evaluated early in their programming through virtual focus groups with students and mentors as well as observations of synchronous, distance activities. The results of these evaluations will be reported rapidly to the BIO-REU PIs to enable prompt adjustments and refinements of distance program activities. Then, additional focus group and survey data will be collected to determine the extent to which distance REUs are able to (a) build a sense of community in their cohorts, (b) ensure student ownership of their research projects, (c) provide quality mentorship at a distance, and (d) influence students’ professional growth and their education and career interests. Data will be compared across REU sites and with published studies of in-person REU sites to identify strategies useful for improving student learning in distance REUs. Results will be shared in reports to each REU site in order to make improvements and published for the undergraduate STEM education community to apply lessons learned in future undergraduate research programming. 

This project will accomplish two major goals: (1) evaluating distance REUs in order to improve student learning and research workforce development and (2) producing new knowledge about the effectiveness of distance REU programming. Using established approaches and measurements for evaluating undergraduate research experiences, the project will involve conducting focus groups, observing program activities, and collecting survey data from undergraduate researchers and their research mentors at REU sites across the country that are operating at a distance due to COVID19. Results from analysis of focus groups and observations will be rapidly reported to REU site leaders to make immediate improvements to better support student learning. Results from surveys and focus groups will be used to determine the extent to which distance REUs are able to achieve similar goals to in-person REUs, including building a sense of community, ensuring robust student involvement in research, providing quality mentorship at a distance, and influencing students’ professional growth and their education and career interests. The project will produce tested strategies for engaging undergraduates in research at a distance, which could be applied to other circumstances such as serving students who are not able to travel to a distant REU site or engaging students following natural disasters. The project will be conducted in the context of biology, which is the domain of STEM with the largest number of undergraduate researchers.

"The objective of this project is to provide a unique opportunity for undergraduate engineering design teams and trainees with a disability, including those from Historically Black Colleges and Universities and primarily undergraduate institutions, to showcase their product innovations in rehabilitation and assistive devices. This objective will be accomplished through a two-year commitment to support a national design competition to be hosted at an established venue such as the Summer Biomechanics, Biotransport and Bioengineering Conference (SB3C) where undergraduate teams from across the country can submit their designs. The abstracts will be reviewed by faculty experts and the top six teams will be invited to attend the venue and present their work in a special podium session. Each of the finalists will receive $3000 for travel and prototype development. An innovative element of this year’s podium session is the inclusion of an invited motivational with a disability. As a role model, this speaker will kick off the session while presenting their scholarly contribution in areas that promote device design in rehabilitation engineering or assistive technologies. The stability of the competition for the next two years allows the organizer to recruit earlier and be able to confirm with teams that funds will be available for travel and prototyping in advance of the submission deadlines. This competition will provide an opportunity for faculty across the country to use it as a motivational component in the process of fostering creativity. Undergraduate students attending the conference through their involvement in the competition will learn about bio-solid mechanics, bio-fluid mechanics, device design, rehabilitation, cellular and molecular mechanics, functional tissue engineering, bio-heat and mass transfer, and bioengineering education. Numerous podium sessions, poster sessions, workshops and plenary talks are designed to engage and excite the attendees including the session for the undergraduate design competition.

The undergraduate design competition will broaden the benefits of the component of motivation to other undergraduate students and their faculty mentors across the country. Further, the materials developed as part of this project will be shared with all faculty mentors involved in prior and future competitions. This competition provides a national venue (with many international attendees) for teams to showcase their innovations in the areas of rehabilitation and assistive devices and compete with their peers. Undergraduate students attending the conference will participate in a research-driven event with technical sessions, workshops and presentations by faculty, clinicians, and industrial representatives who have expertise in device design, rehabilitation, disabilities, and numerous other areas. Also, funding will make travel possible for students who otherwise might not attend an academic conference. Attendance at the conference provides valuable networking opportunities for the students, including contacts for graduate school and employment. The inclusion of the competition at the conference also exposes attendees to innovative solutions for the needs of individuals with disabilities, or those undergoing rehabilitation.

"The original minerals from Earth’s primordial ocean preserve signals of the evolution of early life and ocean chemistry. To fully understand the implications of these minerals, it is necessary to recreate these phases in controlled laboratory conditions. This study focuses on the formation of iron silicates, recently identified as early minerals from marine sediments deposited during the first two billion years of Earth’s history. We will simulate the ancient ocean surface water in which a portion of iron is oxidized, the descent of the particulate products through the deep ocean, and the hypothesized respiration of the oxidized iron by microbial life in the sediments, characterizing the solid products of each step. This project will support two graduate students to lead this research and receive training in experimental geobiology. Researchers will additionally demonstrate how it is possible to recreate ancient iron precipitates in the lab and perform electron microscopy of ancient sediments with students in U-Michigan’s Earth Camp program, a summer program to expose underserved high school students to Earth and Environmental Sciences. An alum of this program who attends U-Michigan will receive a paid opportunity to assist with the proposed research, giving them valuable lab experience and a supportive laboratory community to assist in the retention of underrepresented students in the department.

This project will identify likely (bio)chemical reactions that occurred in the ancient ocean and sediments, enabling to update the investigator’s model of the early iron (bio)chemical cycle. Iron-rich silicates appear to be early minerals in marine Archean (4.0 – 2.5 Ga) chemical sediments known as ‘Banded Iron Formations (BIFs)’. However, it is unknown whether reduction-oxidation (redox) processes, hypothesized to be present in the Archean ocean and often mediated by life, promoted the formation of such silicates. The proposed work will investigate what solid products are formed from plausible processes in the Archean ocean, thereby generating predictions as to which of these pathways contributed to the Archean iron cycle and how BIF minerals, particularly iron silicates, may reflect ancient (bio)chemical reactions. Specifically, researcher will answer the questions: 1) What are the initial solid products of partial Fe(II) oxidation under hypothesized Archean ocean conditions? 2) How are the initial solid products of partial iron oxidation chemically modified under Archean oceanic water column conditions? 3) How does microbial respiration of Fe(II,III)-silica products transform their chemistry and mineralogy? The experiments will address these questions by replicating Archean water column environments with trace levels of O2, then exposing these solids to anoxic water column conditions to simulate exposure during particle descent, followed by simulating early diagenesis by feeding these precipitates to an iron-reducing bacterial strain. This process-based, mechanistic approach will determine which plausible redox reactions in the Archean ocean produce iron silicates or other minerals found in BIFs, yielding insights into the interplay between life and geochemistry in the Archean Eon.

"The practice of biology has transitioned over the last two decades to become increasingly reliant on quantitative approaches to drawing conclusions from data. Consequently, an introduction to both descriptive and inferential statistical thinking is now standard practice for the undergraduate biology course ""Bio 101"" - a course taken by over 1.2 million students in the U.S. annually. Despite the large numbers of students in introductory biology courses, there is a dearth of active discussion about teaching and assessment when integrating statistical thinking into biology courses. Recently, the statistics education community has established guidelines for assessment and instructional best practices when teaching statistics. Furthermore, there is a prominent movement to use modern, computationally-intensive statistical methods (simulation, randomization tests, and bootstrapping) that utilize active learning pedagogical strategies and have preliminary evidence of improving student learning. Despite these recent changes, there are limited venues to discuss and coordinate best practices for the teaching and assessment of statistical thinking for biology students - many of whom may never take an Introductory Statistics course or will take such a course at a very different time than their introductory biology course. To address these challenges, the Statistical Thinking in Undergraduate Biology (STUB) network will be formed, consisting of over 500 biology and statistics instructors. The network will directly impact over 100,000 students during the five-year period of the award, with many thousands impacted in the following years. With particular focus on a diverse set of institutions, backgrounds, and learning environments (e.g., institutions serving large numbers of underrepresented and underserved students, including two-year colleges), the project has the potential for effecting a substantial change in the content and focus of the teaching of statistical thinking in undergraduate biology across the country.

As part of the network, participants will engage in workshops and an online learning community dedicated to the discussion and sharing of ideas, resources, and techniques. A key tangible outcome of the workshops and online learning community will be freely available, class-tested, and edited modules co-developed by biologists and statisticians for use in teaching statistical ideas. The STUB network will also serve to assist in coordinating the assessment of statistical thinking and student attitudes in introductory biology courses. The network will share best practices on assessment, vet potential assessment items, and share assessment results, as well as evaluate the efficacy of the workshops and the online learning community in improving instructor and student outcomes. The STUB network will provide a forum for serious and impactful discussions about teaching statistics in introductory biology courses, resulting in (a) the development and wide dissemination of numerous freely available modules and assessment items for teaching, (b) published peer-reviewed articles on teaching best practices and assessment results related to statistical thinking in undergraduate biology courses, (c) a long-lasting improvement in the teaching of statistical thinking in the undergraduate biology curriculum, and (d) introductory statistics courses reflecting the needs and perspective of biology (and other quantitative science) students.

"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).  In this project, funded by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and housed in the Chemistry Division, Professor Binglin Sui and his students will work to develop a series of stimuli-responsive, biocompatible and biodegradable polymers and polymer-based nanomaterials that can be extensively utilized in the biological and medical worlds. Biosafety and sustainability have become two critical issues of bio-oriented nanomaterials with the rapid development of nanotechnology, resulting from the fact that those materials with nanoscale sizes could not be eliminated from the body and their accumulation in the body is likely to induce chronic systemic toxicities. The new polymers that Prof. Sui will develop consist of biodegradable polymer chains containing bio-cleavable chemical bonds. Therefore, in biological and physiological environments, the polymers and polymer-based nanomaterials will gradually break down and eventually turn into nontoxic small molecules in the body, devoid of biosafety and sustainability concerns. Prof. Sui will use cancer-related biomedical applications of the new materials to promote students’ awareness of human health issues and to get graduate and undergraduate students as well as the underrepresented Native American students from tribal colleges in North Dakota engaged in the research. 

Prof. Sui proposes to address the challenges of nanomaterials that are currently preventing the majority of materials with nanoscale sizes from biomedical applications, especially for bioimaging and nanomedicine. To that end, the new polymers are composed of biodegradable backbones containing bio-cleavable chemical bonds and stimuli-responsive and self-immolative side chains, bestowing the polymeric nanosystems capabilities of covalent conjugation of diagnostic, therapeutic, and genetic agents; controllable traceless-release of the conjugated agents on demand with maximal agent-releasing efficiency; and decomposition into nontoxic small molecules in the body after liberating loaded cargos, inducing no long-term concerns of biosafety and sustainability. The development of such materials expects to advance the evolution of bioimaging and nanomedicine into a biosafe, more reliable, and more efficient technique compared to traditional medicinal methods for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases. Furthermore, the proposed strategy for solving the critical issues will pave the way for the development of more and more biosafe and sustainable polymers and nanomaterials. Prof. Sui plans to involve graduate and undergraduate students, especially underrepresented minority students in STEM fields, as well as high school students in the project to broaden the integration of research and participation-oriented outreach activities.

"This award will promote the progress of science and contribute to the advancement of national prosperity and health by introducing new computational methods to guide the design and control of modern manufacturing facilities, such as complex bio-manufacturing processes that produce personalized medical treatments. High-fidelity simulation models that can be used to evaluate the performance of a manufacturing system are computationally intensive and often require expensive data collection, limiting their use. On the other hand, queueing models use less computation time but are less accurate.  There is a substantial gap in understanding how to effectively make use of both high- and low-fidelity models to design and control such systems. This award supports advancing theoretical foundations and algorithm development for large-scale global optimization enabling the use of multiple models of varying accuracy and computational effort. This research will have broad impact on the growth of bio-manufacturing in the U.S., and will provide a diverse population of students with the education and training needed to deploy and extend these tools, advancing the national economic welfare.

This project will create a new Multi-fidelity Accelerated Global Search (MAGS) framework for stochastic global optimization that will intelligently combine high- and low-fidelity models to dynamically allocate computational effort guided by statistical analysis of solution quality. The goal is to reduce the number of high-fidelity simulation evaluations by taking advantage of low-fidelity models, thus integrating model approximation (learning) with optimization (search). This research addresses algorithmic design, scalability, and finite-time stochastic analysis of MAGS.  The project will provide a theoretical foundation for computational complexity and aid in deriving a dynamic and adaptable decomposition scheme to realize large-scale optimization.  The design and operation of an individualized bio-manufacturing system will be used to test and refine MAGS throughout its development.

"This project aims to explore an innovative bio-mediated fiber reinforced soil concept that can significantly improve soil erosion resistance. Soil erosion by stream or wind causes significant environmental and economic consequences. The estimated cost of soil erosion on the US farmland is as high as $44 billion per year. Wind-induced soil erosion associated with construction or mining activities, i.e., dust, negatively impacts air quality and consequently the health of workers, their communities, and the environment. Soil erosion around bridge foundations (i.e., bridge scour) is the No. 1 cause of bridge failures. Improvement of soil erosion resistance requires enhancing the inter-particle bonds, which is commonly achieved by use of chemicals such as lime or cement. Such treatments, however, are not sustainable since the production of these chemicals consumes nonrenewable resources and produces significant carbon footprints. This innovative research will leverage fibrous fungi, a microorganism abundant in soils, to achieve environmentally-benign, sustainable soil improvement by: 1) reinforcing the soil microstructure with the fungi-induced bio-adhesion and fiber network, and 2) leveraging the hydrophobic nature of fungi fibers to reduce the interfacial erosive shear stress induced by flowing water. The project will provide graduate and undergraduate students opportunities to work on an interdisciplinary research topic. The recruitment efforts will emphasize involving female and minority students. The research will be incorporated into instructional materials. The project outcomes will be disseminated via a variety of outreach activities on the Case Western Reserve University campus and in collaboration with local communities.  

The goal of this research is to understand the multiscale interactions between fungi and soils, and therefore, offer insight on how fungi-soil interactions can be tailored to improve soil erosion resistance.  The research objectives of this research include: 1) the study of topological interactions between fungi and soil, fungi adaptation to soil microstructure and response to bio-stimuli to design tactics to tailor the growth of fungi fibers in soil; 2) the understanding of the physico-chemical interactions between fungi and soil particles to guide the development of  models describing the effects of fungi fiber on soil engineering behaviors; 3) the assessment of the effects of fungi on soil macroscopic performance properties, such as the soil aggregation, fiber reinforcement, soil water characteristics, and transport properties and how these improve the soil erosion resistance. The research will generate foundational knowledge on fungi-soil interactions and quantify their impacts on the soil engineering properties. It will break new ground in biomediated geotechnical engineering for sustainable soil improvement.

"This project supports partial travel for 19 U.S. students and early career engineers/faculty to the 2nd Micro Flow and Interfacial Phenomena (μFIP) Conference. The conference, one of the premier annual events for researchers in the fields of transport phenomena, will be held in Irvine, CA, from June 20 to 23, 2022. The μFIP Conference provides a platform for researchers to exchange information and identify research needs in emerging areas of phase change, micro flows and interfacial phenomena, encompassing engineering, basic sciences, and bio-medical disciplines. Eight technical tracks in fundamentals, applications, and emerging innovations, as well as three panels on leadership, government funding, and students, are organized in the conference. This μFIP conference emphasizes on energy applications and promotes interdisciplinary research to address climate change and water-energy nexus. The in-person platform offered by the conference is expected to lead to interesting and fruitful technical conversations that are important and timely.

Micro flows and interfacial phenomena affect a broad spectrum of the industry and life in general. Advances in this field enabled by the conference may help improve and optimize a large number of applications that benefit the society. Both fundamental and applied sciences will be disseminated, with academic, national lab, and industrial participation. It is expected that the conference will lead to novel, collaborative approaches for addressing fundamental and applied problems in phase change and single-phase heat transfer, single- and multi-phase flows, bio-chemical and bio-medical engineering, and microflow processes including microchannel flows and microscale surface phenomena. A special emphasis is on formal and informal exchanges of ideas between junior researchers and established researchers in a friendly environment, with a focus on advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion. Student networking events that consist of a student presentation session and a student panel will be organized to allow for ample interactions among the youngest generation of researchers.

"This research will develop the scientific and technological foundations for design of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with bat shapes and flying abilities. These bat-like UAVs will be non-intrusive and safe to operate in shared spaces to provide situational awareness to humans. Our bat-inspired design will also be collision-tolerant to negotiate cluttered, hard-to-access environments in the physical world. The resulting technology can significantly improve public safety and vehicular dynamic traffic control in smart cities and cost-effectiveness associated with monitoring environmental disasters. Ultimately, the UAV can provide computing, communication and sensing capabilities in large-scale systems such as, residential buildings, streets, construction zones, and state parks. These capabilities should result in enormous societal impact and economic benefit. In addition, as the result of this project, a new generation of scientists and engineers will be trained in addressing multidisciplinary challenges at the intersection of theory and experiment. The project will create programs and tools to train workforce with new skills including bio-inspired robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and nonlinear control theory. 

This research adopts an artificial intelligence-guided framework to study bat's flight maneuvers including perching (i.e. upside-down landing), zero-path flight, and hovering. Due to the fact that the salient aspects of the bat's wing motion can be represented in a low-dimensional subspace, we will apply an auto-encoding variational inference approach on the flying data from real animal  in order to extract low dimensional, yet interpretable, embedding of the its underlying flight model. We will also use a high-fidelity virtual environment for 3D modeling, synthetic design and validation of the extracted low-dimensional latent variables. This will also lead to better understating of the bat sensory feedback mechanism through a data-driven procedure. Our research objective will simplify the engineering procedure to design bio-inspired aerial co-robots that closely mimic the flight behavior of a target animal, therefore is directly towards lowering the barriers for understanding fundamentals regarding closed-loop control and design of bio-inspired multimodal co-robots. In order to achieve the proposed research objectives, we will center our effort around conducting two main phases during the one year timeline of this project: first, AI-guided analysis and modeling of bat's various flight maneuvers, and second, development of a soft and collision-tolerant bat-inspired aerial agent capable of landing on structures. These two phases will be accomplished by team's cross-disciplinary collaborative, as components are highly interlinked and dependent.

"Ubiquitous sensing and computing, leading to rapid growth of big data analysis, will potentially transform the world. That vision creates new challenges for pervasive sensory interfaces to enable the always-on feature, rapid analysis of information, and design for security to prevent cyberattacks. In the meantime, however, significant power will be consumed to run machine learning and complex cryptography algorithms. Critical challenges also exist in integrating classifiers and security measures into sensors to enable continuous monitoring. This project proposes an integrated program of research, education, and outreach to develop low-power sensory systems with theory, algorithms and architectures to enable in-sensor intelligence and security. The transformative aspects of this research project include fundamental understanding of bio-inspired computing, discovering useful intrinsic device characteristics, analysis of real-time data with adaptive machine learning, and exploring chaotic behaviors for efficient encryption. This research will have a significant impact on the needs of society for secure and continuous real-time monitoring to improve health, transportation, and environment through the developments of ubiquitous sensing and computing. This project also incorporates an integrated education plan to inspire and motivate younger generations with diverse backgrounds, in particular women and underrepresented minorities, to pursue education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The plan will introduce the concepts of secure ubiquitous sensing and computing to undergraduate and graduate students, and create strong outreach activities to local K-12 students by illustrating easily-understood concepts of fundamental electronics and mathematics with compelling examples.

The goal of this project is to develop ultra-low-power sensory interfaces that integrate autonomous sensing, classification, and secure measures into a single hardware platform. The bio-inspired classifiers incorporating combinatorial intrinsic characteristics emulate sophisticated biological systems where sensing, learning, and decision making are carried out through nonlinear and adaptive analog computing. The proposed architecture is driven by fast regeneration to extract relative timing information for hierarchical classification. Instead of using linear amplification and fine integration, inherent device mismatch and nonlinearity are exploited in time domain to achieve energy-efficient computation under low supply voltages. To process real-time data in sensors, Bernoulli variational distributions are employed for approximating the posterior to develop a computationally-efficient multi-layer neural network with Bayesian methods. The algorithm integrates medical knowledge and statistical analysis into the training process for adaptation to incoming signals. The proposed algorithm explores maximum sparsity in both sample and feature spaces, where regularizations of hardware constraints are included in the model to ensure robustness. Moreover, to perform encryption in sensors, the information will be randomized into deterministic noise for transmission. The pipeline chaotic system can be trained with time-varying maps to enhance the strength of the security without creating observable patterns to counter side-channel attacks. The transformation function is built with combinatorial intrinsic characteristics, which are physically unclonable to ensure complete security measures. This ensures data integrity and basic authentication for multi-layer security schemes from the edge sensors to the cloud while classification algorithms are performed locally in sensors to achieve rapid analysis and data reduction for wireless communications.

"<p>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY
Many organisms in nature have adapted microscopic hairs and fibrils as robust adhesives for locomotion purposes and/or securing a strong attachment. Geckos are among the most studied species for developing bio-inspired dry adhesives due to their fairly large body size and sophisticated toe pad structure. Despite great improvements on adhesion strength, the durability and reusability of many lab-scale 'proof-of-principle' artificial adhesives still lag behind their natural counterparts, even being tested on smoother and cleaner substrates. In this project, adhesive arrays with controlled contact shapes and geometries will be fabricated using template-assisted cast molding and advanced micro-fabrication techniques. Adhesive behavior will be characterized to simultaneously measure adhesion and friction under non-idealized conditions (e.g., on non-dust-free surfaces, and at different temperatures and humidity). Computer simulation will be performed to explain the experimental results. Overall, the proposed work provides an alternative approach to study surface and interfacial phenomena of advanced smart superstructures mimicking nature. Students will examine problems at the crossroads of engineering, materials science, physics, chemistry, and other related disciplines. Exploring a broad range of applications by building up state-of-the-art versatile mechanical system and simulation tools will substantially enhance research productivity, and provide essential research training to undergraduate and graduate students at Cal State LA and in the Southern California region. The educational plan contributes to Cal State LA's long tradition of educating local minority and underrepresented students to become the next generation of engineers, scientists, and educators whose vision is to link science priorities to the solving of societal problems.</p>

<p>TECHNICAL SUMMARY
Efforts to mimic gecko toe pad structure and function seek to develop a new class of advanced adhesives that are not only sticky and easy to unstick, but also non-fouling. Current synthetic dry adhesives suffer from large required preloading and intolerance of dusty environments, which significantly limit their use for sticking to or manipulating fragile and non-dust-free objects. This project focuses on understanding the engaging and disengaging mechanisms of anisotropic fibrillar adhesive units featuring a variety of contact shapes/geometries and structural/materials gradient across multiple lengths and temporal scales. The proposed dry adhesive design incorporates both the geometrical anisotropy seen at the setal level and the special contact shape of the setal branches at the spatula level. The ultimate goal is to elucidate how adhesion and friction are coupled and may be better controlled by rationally designing the geometry dependent dry adhesive units. Adhesive performance will be evaluated under cyclic loadings and non-dust-free environments, as well as different temperatures and relative humidity, using a custom-designed surface force apparatus. Multiscale anisotropic finite-element cohesive-zone modeling will be implemented to parameterize the contact shape dependent interfacial behaviors, and to analyze the adhesive mechanisms, fracture and failures. This project will yield both basic and applied advances in biomimetic research, e.g., development of switchable and self-cleaning surfaces; micro-/nanomanipulations; and high tolerance dry adhesives and drug delivery systems for robotics, energy and biomedical applications.</p>

"Carbon-based waste from everyday sources, like landfills, agricultural processes, wastewater treatment, and more, are typically “wet” wastes, which makes them difficult to convert to biofuels using traditional methods. This work focuses on a process called “hydrothermal carbonization” (HTC), which converts these already wet bio-materials into high-grade fuels, which is both more efficient and cost effective than typical methods. The resultant fuel is known as “hydrochar,” a carbon-condensed solid often referred to as bio-coal for its “coal-like” properties. Compared to coal combustion, hydrochars emit fewer hazardous air pollutants and have a near net-zero CO2 impact. During the formation of these hydrochars, however, a tar-like substance forms on the surface, which initial research suggests could significantly change their combustion behavior. The goal of this work is two-fold: first, understand the formation pathways and chemical composition of the tar-like substance and second, understand the impact that the tar-like substance has on important combustion behaviors like ignition and particle burn-out. The work will include a close collaboration between different fields, bringing the fields of fuel synthesis and combustion closer through carefully-designed experiments. Significant outreach to both technical communities and the industries they support will support the adoption of hydrochars as a replacement for coal in energy production. The ability to use such renewable solid fuels for energy generation can help mitigate climate change and transform the U.S. into a green energy exporter and job opportunity creator. To fill such high-tech positions, we need a diverse workforce; the PIs – tenure-track female professors at Cornell and Penn State – both have strong track records training students from under-represented groups. At least two graduate and two undergraduate students will be trained on this project.

Hydrothermal carbonization is widely touted for its ability to transform moist biomass streams into renewable solid fuels that could be used as replacements for coal in energy generation. Despite the potential benefits of HTC for waste management, a reactive amorphous secondary char often forms on the surface of the solid hydrochar during carbonization. This secondary char may hamper the ability of these “bio-coals” to be used as drop-in fuels for combustion due to the drastically different reactivity of the secondary char. To date, the renewable fuels literature characterizes hydrochars only through thermogravimetric analysis of rapid oxidation, not true combustion behavior. As such, we know little about their combustion behavior, relying only on basic fuel characterizations to gauge this renewable solid fuel’s potential. The goal of the work – the first study of its kind – is to understand the fundamental combustion behavior of biomass-based hydrochars, a solid fuel with unique burning characteristics. The work will improve our fundamental understanding of (1) the mechanisms of hydrothermal carbonization and (2) the combustion behavior of renewable solid fuels with condensed tarry phases. A key broader impact of the proposed work is to rigorously connect two (surprisingly) disparate fields – Renewable Fuel Science and Combustion Science. The closely-coupled work between the PIs will provide not only a scientific foundation for linking these two communities, but the PIs will actively participate in each other’s research communities to bridge the gap. The PIs will work with an HTC technology development firm to disseminate information to the designers of large-scale HTC processing equipment and potential customers interested in firing hydrochars for energy generation.

"Congestive Heart Failure affects nearly six million Americans, with 670,000 diagnosed annually. Heart failure is one of the leading causes of hospital admission and readmission and death in the United States and one of the costliest disease syndromes. A major portion of this high cost of care is related to managing episodes of heart failure decompensation in the hospital. These recurring hospitalizations reduces the quality of life of heart failure patients, preventing them to lead productive and fulfilling lives. Ever rising costs, growing population of aging adults with chronic conditions necessitate new predictive, personalized and proactive approaches to cardiovascular health. The standard care to heart failure management relies on readily observable symptoms such as weight gain and labored breathing. Unfortunately, because these symptoms appear late in the course of heart failure decompensation, intervention is applied after hospitalization. In this proposal we pursue a proactive approach to care supported by innovations in noninvasive multimodal sensor systems paired with machine learning models for assessing the risk of heart failure decompensation and supporting interventions to prevent hospitalization in heart failure patients. 

The aims of this project are (a)  Design, fabrication and validation an easy to use sensor patch that combines four key modalities to assess cardiac and lung function: Electrocardiogram (ECG). Bio Radio Frequency(RF), Bio-Impedance, and Seismocardiogram( SCG) (b) Learning  of latent variable models for linking sensor measures to the risk of developing decompensated heart failure events with contextual information from electronic health records (EHR), and (c) Development of interpretable Deep Learning models for combining EHR data with multimodal sensor data for risk prediction and guiding therapy. The design of the sensor patch will explore new techniques integrating signals from a wide range of frequency bands into a single flexible board operating autonomously under a power budget. The joint sensor models developed in this project for ECG, SCG, Bio- RF and Impedance will provide insights into the noninvasive measures related to cardiovascular health previously only available to invasive methods such as implanted sensors and catheterizations. These non-invasive measures of cardiac health will be used to develop a learning based data fusion model for inferring latent health status quantified as decompensation risk. The project will result in interpretable deep learning models for combining multimodal EHR data with multimodal sensor data for early detection of compensated state and guiding medical interventions. These models will account for the sparse and non-uniform sampling of patient data in time, and employ learning of multi-modal embeddings for interpretability.

"NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:

Natural killer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (NKE) are natural nanoparticles that are inherently biocompatible, stable in vivo, and contain anti-viral components. As such, investigating the materials properties of NKE will be critical to informing the design of synthetic, biomimetic nanoparticles that can be scaled-up for anti-viral application including COVID-19. To meet these needs, the overall goal of this EAGER award by the Biomaterials Program is to study the nanomaterial properties, membrane composition, and cargo of NKE. Using this new knowledge, the PI and her lab will test how these material properties affect membrane fusion, as well as cell internalization and anti-viral function against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since NK cell activity has been found to differ among various patient populations, the PI will also elucidate how the materials properties of extracellular vesicles vary with biological factors, and can be used to obtain new knowledge that is critical for compatibility, stability, and overall performance of drug delivery systems. These research efforts will be integrated with education and outreach initiatives for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students and for the public. The activities at the college and graduate levels are centered on recruitment, mentorship, and training women, URM, and LGBTQ students through in-depth research experiences, while K-12 activities are based on classroom lectures and hands-on demos. In addition, the PI will interact with the public through an established collaboration with the California Science Center and a social media platform for K-12 students. The goal is to inspire, engage, and prepare the next generation of scientists and engineers from diverse backgrounds to develop innovative solutions that can benefit global public health.

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:

Natural killer (NK) cells are the first line of defense against viral infections and helps eliminate unhealthy host cells. Although NK cells have been proposed as a cell-based therapy against diseases caused by viral infections such as COVID-19, cell therapy has challenges including limited cell survival in vivo, short shelf-life, and high cost. Instead, the cytotoxic, extracellular vesicles (EVs) that endow natural killing properties to NK cells have the potential to be scaled-up as long-term, off-the-shelf drug delivery carriers and can be used to inform the design of stable, biomimetic drug delivery carriers for anti-viral application. To that end, the PI and her lab will first 1) characterize the material properties, as well as lipid, protein, and RNA membrane and cargo composition of NK EVs (NKE) originating from several human sources. Then, the PI and her lab will 2) evaluate NKE cell internalization and anti-viral activity in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and assess how differences in NKE composition and materials properties influences their function. Success of the research plan is anticipated to advance fundamental knowledge of NKE, and elucidate their material properties as it relates to anti-viral function. Thus, the results from the research proposal may be significant during the current pandemic (e.g. COVID-19) in evaluating NKE as a novel source of anti-viral therapy, but will have potential benefits for immunotherapy in other viral infections. The research plan is integrated with the education and outreach plan which includes: 1) recruitment, training, and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds including women, URM, and LGBTQ groups through in-depth research experiences, 2) classroom lecture and hands-on activities regarding bio-nanomaterials including nanoparticle carriers in recent COVID-19 vaccines (32nd Street School, Los Angeles Unified School District), and 3) NanoDays, an annual program that will include bio-nanotechnology demos at the California Science Center, and NanoPeek, our social media platform that showcases bio-nanotechnology content. Together, these initiatives aim to excite, engage, and disseminate knowledge to a diverse audience ranging from K-12 to the public regarding bionanomaterials in medicine and its potential to solve global public health issues such as pandemics. The effectiveness of the programs will be evaluated for each activity.

"Over the past 50 million years, the near-field auditory system of aye-ayes, one of the most unique and endangered primates in the world, has evolved to perform an exceptional foraging behavior called tap-scanning.  As the aye-aye moves along the surface of a tree, it taps the wood with its unusual middle finger while keeping its nose near the tree’s surface and its large ears bent forward to detect deep cavities in tree bark that contains the worms they eat. This behavior is very similar to what is done in nondestructive evaluation (NDE), a process where an active acoustic wave is generated and the response from a material (e.g., echo) is used to characterize material properties as well as to detect and evaluate defects (e.g., cavities). The aye-aye’s tap-scanning behavior is unique, making it particularly valuable for creating new NDE technologies. The main goal of Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) research is to understand the exceptional near-field acoustic-based sensing and detection capabilities of aye-ayes, inspiring the creation of new NDE methods. This grant will help support research that will provide a foundation for developing bio-inspired NDE methods, both promoting science and ensuring the safety of our nation’s aging infrastructures. Reliable NDE methods are needed to inspect aging structures, such as bridges, pipelines, power plants, and aircrafts, as well as provide quality control assessments for complex manufactured components. Therefore, this research will benefit both the U.S. economy and promoting the safety of U.S. society by circumventing catastrophic failures of critical aging infrastructures. 

The principal hypothesis of this research is that the exceptional near-field auditory system of aye-ayes has resulted from two marvelous adaptations: (i) shape and morphology of the aye-aye’s pinnae, ear canals, and head have adapted to enhance the noise reduction and reception of sound reflected from tapping and increase the near-field acoustic beam resolution and (ii) morphological features of the aye-aye’s middle finger have adapted to provide unique acoustic cues during tap-scanning. To test these hypotheses, the research team will perform bio-mimetic and numerical studies. First, a robotic platform will be used to mimic the aye-aye’s middle finger during tap-scanning. The effects of the pinna, head, and ear canal in enhancing the aye-aye’s acoustic near-field sensing will be evaluated experimentally. Second, finite element models will be used to numerically analyze the acoustic field of the aye-aye’s auditory system. Finally, a bio-inspired tap-scanner will be designed and manufactured to be used to inspect composite materials.

"The ability to integrate living tissues with electronic and photonic devices has potential to impact many aspects of human health, including neurological/neuromuscular disease and injury, such as spinal cord injury and Alzheimer's disease and secretory pathologies, such as diabetes and glaucoma. To date, bioelectronic devices have been employed in several arenas, most notably cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants, which have enabled tens of thousands of profoundly deaf people to communicate in a hearing world, and deep brain stimulation, which became widely used in the 1990’s to treat Parkinson disease and essential tremor. Despite the success of these devices, the potential for bioelectrical and biophotonic devices has scarcely been realized, limited in part by challenges in interfacing devices with living tissues and the potential tissue damage due to device insertion. This future manufacturing seed grant will develop new manufacturing methods to create electronic and photonic devices that are biocompatible (i.e., able to facilitate growth and function of healthy biological tissues) and are bio-resilient (i.e., able to withstand the wet, salty, proteinaceous chemical environment of biological systems). In addition, it will address how to interface the living tissue with electronic and photonic devices so that information (e.g., brain electrical signals, muscle stimulation, neuronal responses) can be transferred between the electronic or photonic device and the living system. This project will build on existing advanced technical education programs in semiconductor technologies and biomedical advanced technologies to identify the core competencies required for the field of manufacturing and train a workforce at the community college, bachelors, masters, and doctoral degree level, broadening participation through our interactions with community college partners and engaging with industry to ensure that the curriculum developed remains responsive to industry needs. Finally, a detailed curriculum based upon core competencies identified by the project team in conjunction with the Industrial Advisory Board will be developed and piloted at key community colleges and in bachelors and masters level programs at SUNY Polytechnic Institute and Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. Feedback from trainees and the Industrial Advisory Board will be used to refine the curriculum for wider deployment in the Future Manufacturing Research Grant phase. This Future Manufacturing project is jointly funded by the Divisions of ECCS and CBET in the Directorate of Engineering. 

Leveraging the strengths of SUNY Polytechnic Institute, AIM Photonics (a federally-funded American Institute for Manufacturing entity located at SUNY Polytechnic Institute), the Northeast Advanced Technological Education Center (an NSF-funded training program) and partners including Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences and the Neural Stem Cell Institute, this future manufacturing seed grant will focus on design and manufacturing of silicon-wafer electronic and photonic devices with two technical objectives: 1) Design and manufacture of silicon-wafer electronic and photonic devices to interface with biological materials and 2) Development of interfaces for electrical and photonic interaction and measurement of 3D cultures. To identify the barriers to addressing these challenges at the manufacturing scale, the project will include preliminary research focused on two testbeds: 1) Implementation of a pressure sensing device that can measure outflow from ocular tissues to address development of glaucoma therapeutics; 2) Creation of multielectrode arrays interfaced with three-dimensional cell cultures (e.g., neuronal organoids) for electrical stimulation and observation. A significant focus in these testbed experiments will be on design for manufacturability, to enable the transition from laboratory devices to manufactured devices. In addition, a series of workshops with a wide range of academic and industrial partners will be conducted to identify additional research and manufacturing issues to be addressed in a subsequent Future Manufacturing Research Grant.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is related to the use of a patient’s own fat tissue for repair after injury or surgery. Removing tissue to eliminate damage through disease or trauma is universally followed by repairing tissue to restore form and function. While a broad range of materials are available, the use of a patient’s own fat for these procedures has long been considered an obvious option. Fat can be safely harvested, is rich in stem cells and growth factors and has other desirable properties, depending on the location from which it is harvested. The use of this material for surgical procedures has been inhibited by a loss of specific physical properties during the harvesting procedure. Providing a matrix to reconstruct these properties is likely to render fat grafting a more commonplace procedure. By optimizing structure and formulation of this matrix material, tissue engineering can be disrupted with an off-the-shelf option enabling harvested fat from a patient to address the hundreds of thousands of reconstructive procedures undertaken each year.

The proposed project is based on the use of elastin-based recombinant proteins to address the current limitations of tissue repair scaffolds. The proposed technology uses highly disordered proteins to produce defined 3D structures to replicate mechanical and biological activities of the body. Using iterative design and molecular engineering, the team has generated a new class of biomaterials that are uniquely suited to meet the key criteria for a fat grafting support matrix, including injectability, in vivo phase transition to a firm solid, and biocompatibility to allow cellular viability and vascularization. This project focuses on optimization of the matrix for reconstruction procedures, including facial, breast, amputation sites and foot pad tissues. A range of materials with unique biomechanical properties are likely required to address each of the target use cases.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is substantial improvement in artificial intelligence. Despite advances in AI, the current state-of-the-art platforms are still weak in learning and require large amounts of training data. The proposed system creates a better AI system by exploring more relationships within complex data sets.  The initial application is cancer detection in genomic data. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel relation-oriented machine learning platform. Current platforms are object-oriented, where objects (e.g., words, sequence data, etc.) are represented as feature vectors. The feature vector representation is powerful in performing tasks such as pattern recognition, classification, and regression but ineffective in learning the interrelationships of objects in great detail. An in-depth understanding of objects is paramount in learning. Also, the meaning of objects is defined and can only be defined through their interrelationship with other objects. Based on category theory in mathematics and quantum physics, the proposed platform is relation-oriented. It maps and preserves the interrelationship between objects in all dimensions. Based on the observed concurrences of objects and their relations, the platform fuses them to create more complex objects progressively and learns their interrelations iteratively to form a hierarchical structure associated with the dataset. This platform automatically learns the meaning of objects and the governing rules between them.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve and accelerate the development of antibody therapies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Antibody therapies are in development to target SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, but emerging virus mutations may result in resistance and require the development of new therapies. Antibody therapies typically enter the clinic after a year of development or longer, and the medical and economic consequences of this delay are severely felt throughout the world. To reduce the time to produce an antibody against an emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutant, this project develops a computational platform trained using massive experimental datasets to rapidly predict the therapeutic potency. This platform will enable drugs against SARS-CoV-2 mutants to more rapidly reach the clinic, saving thousands of lives.  Moreover, the proposed platform can be utilized to predict therapeutic efficacy against future coronavirus strains unassociated with the COVID-19 pandemic, providing an invaluable tool to fight future pandemics.

The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of using quantitative and library-on-library protein interaction datasets to train machine learning models for predicting antibody binding to novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Existing approaches to build computational predictions for antibody drug development have been limited to few target variants, since datasets with binding measurements against hundreds or thousands of targets are not available. This project involves optimizing and validating a cell-based platform for generating a sufficient quantity and quality of antibody-antigen binding data for training computational models. The platform uses genetically engineered yeast cells and next generation sequencing to link protein interaction strength with cellular mating frequency. To demonstrate feasibility, large multi-chain antibody libraries will be genomically integrated in yeast and enriched for binding to SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. Next, a large network of antibody-antigen interactions will be measured and validated for quantitative accuracy by comparing to biophysical measurements. Finally, the resulting data will be used to train machine learning models and evaluate their predictive power using cross-validation. Training of computational models with sufficient predictive power will demonstrate the feasibility of using quantitative and library-on-library binding data coupled with machine learning to develop a platform for rapid antibody development to a novel SARS-CoV-2 mutant.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve clinical care for patients requiring blood vessel grafts that are autologous, or come from the same patient.  In the United States,1.4 million patients need arterial replacements each year. Bypass graft surgeries and reconstructive surgeries often involve the replacement of diseased or damaged blood vessels with a graft of an artery or vein taken from another part of the body. These procedures are invasive and dangerous. In addition, using autologous grafts to reconstruct branched vessels in certain indications (e.g., in hand reconstruction surgeries or free-flap procedures) prolongs the surgery and may increase the risk of post-operative complications. The proposed technology allows for creation of engineered systems that can be used as grafts. More over, they can be used for pre-clinical testing of cardiovascular devices, limiting the need (and costs) associated with animal studies, as well as potentially other systems, such as the lung and trachea.

This project advances a process to manufacture a system that follows the complex geometries and characteristics of native blood vessels. Current practice to create artificial blood vessel grafts is limited to simple shapes or systems with non-optimal mechanical/structural properties.  This project develops a new method for creation of nanofibrous vessels with complex geometries via 3D printing, creation of sacrificial collectors, and electrospinning. The first objective will be to develop nanofibrous vessel scaffolds with different geometries (cylindrical, bifurcated, and trifurcated) and diameters using sacrificial collectors and evaluate microstructural and mechanical characteristics of the vessels. The second objective will be to evaluate biocompatibility of the nanofibrous vessels by testing the viability, adhesion, and proliferation of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of applications of differential geometry and optimal transportation toward solving complex optimization problems. The focus of this project is understanding which bio-mechanical parameters capture the key features of complex human motor activities in the area of sports training and recruitment.  The proposed technology may have numerous applications for professional sports as well as for aspiring and amateur athletes. Moreover, it may be beneficial for reducing injury risk for athletes and reducing recovery times for athletes returning from injury. The proposed technology also may be used for player skill development, which plays a central role in sports at all levels. Talent evaluation and player recruitment, which also receives significant resources both at the professional and collegiate levels may also be impacted.  Other fields that may benefit include weather forecasting, optimal network design, economics, physics, and optics.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of mathematical tools and algorithms inspired by the deep theory of the fully nonlinear Monge-Ampere equation that is a common denominator for the vast fields of Differential Geometry and Optimal Transportation.  Differential Geometry is combined with data-analytic tools from Machine Learning and state-of-the-art bio-mechanical research in order to analyze in-depth and develop a new bio-mechanical understanding of certain complex human motor activities that involve the simultaneous use of multiple limbs.  The proposed technology is focused on activities that require a high degree of skill and coordination and that are challenging to train and learn. Understanding whether a specific equation may be used to give mathematical insights on optimizing complex human activities could provide yet another real-world application of this equation and the deep theories used to study it. Iterative processes from Differential Geometry such as the Ricci iteration and flow provide inspiration for training models in infinite-dimensional configuration spaces that may model complex human activities and optimization algorithms.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a rapid, inexpensive, and ultra-high throughput test to screen patients for antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. The proposed test will facilitate population-wide screening for prior exposure, giving epidemiologists and policy-makers insight into the virus's spread and the frequency of asymptomatic cases. Individuals will understand their levels of risk (e.g., someone with strong immunity may be protected from re-infection in the near-term) to make informed decisions.  The proposed technology will be a quantitative test, which may allow immunity level to be correlated with disease severity or other parameters. The proposed test can be adapted easily to query multiple antigens simultaneously to address more complex medical assessments. Beyond the current pandemic, this flexible technology will be useful for exposure testing for diverse pathogens and immunogens in applications ranging from epidemiology to vaccine development.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores a novel method for ultra-high throughput serology testing.  Briefly, high density arrays of patient samples will be queried with fluorescently labeled COVID-19 antigens to identify patients with antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For the proposed project: Sample preparation and arraying (printing) techniques and workflows will be optimized. Assay probes (Covid-19 antigens) and conditions will be optimized using spiked samples and commercially purchased sera from patients, purchased commercially and deidentified.  The assay's sensitivity and specificity will be measured using anti-COVID (50 samples) and non-reactive (100 samples) sera. Finally, given that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is related to other coronaviruses––some of which regularly circulate in humans, the potential for assay probes to cross-react with antibodies raised against previous (i.e., non-COVID) infections will be determined. The results of the proposed work will provide proof-of-concept for massively parallel, population-level serology screening.

"The goals of this project are to use the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition, a global undergraduate research activity at the interface of biological sciences and synthetic biology, as a tool to recruit and retain diverse students in STEM and give them meaningful research experiences through participation in the University of Virginia iGEM team. Participation in the iGEM competition enables and broadens undergraduate participation in synthetic biology research at the University of Virginia, enhancing access for women and individuals under-represented in STEM.  The project develops an inter-disciplinary STEM workforce from a diverse cohort of science and engineering students by providing an opportunity for cross-discipline communication and problem solving. The project also supports the bio-economy by introducing students to and creating an opportunity for student-driven entrepreneurship within the field of synthetic biology.  

The University of Virginia iGEM team has a long and successful of engaging students projects in the field of synthetic biology. The current project concerns the use of synthetic biology for the commercial production of various pharmaceuticals, reagents, and other organic compounds. A major impediment in such commercial productions is the lack of a versatile, reliable, and efficient method to increase the flow of molecules through specific biochemical pathways within a cell.  This problem is addressed in this project with the use of the biosynthesis of resveratrol as an experimental model. Specifically, mathematical modeling combined with existing knowledge of molecular structures is being used to design small artificial compartments within bacteria that serve as a foundry for resveratrol biosynthesis. Once designed, the compartments are assembled in cells, through the regulated expression of synthetic genes, and tested for efficiency, reliability, and versatility. The project builds basic research into a foundational technology to expand the applications of synthetic biology, especially in the area of bio-manufacturing.

The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to understand, and eventually manipulate, the immune, metabolic and microbial activities that occur in the intestines for the purpose of improving human health. Many important diseases are caused or regulated by activities in our intestines, yet very little is known about this hard-to-access organ. This project will develop a pill-sized gastrointestinal sampling device for routine, non-invasive sampling of the human gut and the analysis of its metabolic, microbial, and immunological content for the first time. The discoveries enabled by this project may lead to new commercial opportunities in diagnosing and treating important disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease.

The proposed project seeks to perform validations of a pill-sized gastrointestinal sampling device for routine, non-invasive sampling of the human gut using bench testing and evaluations of clinical samples.  The team will also prepare the collected data for submission to the Food and Drug Administration for market clearance. Sampling the human intestinal tract safely, non-invasively and reliably is a daunting challenge due to the constraints on the size of a device that is safe to swallow and the variability of human physiology. The technology will lead to the commercialization of the first gut sampling device in the market. The device may help elucidate the roles of the gut microbes and their interactions with the immune system and metabolic processes in human health and disease.

"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will promote the progress of science and advance the national health and prosperity by providing new knowledge related to wearable robotics. Wearable robots, such as powered exoskeletons, promise to improve our productivity, health, and independence by augmenting, preserving, and restoring our ability to move. However, existing powered exoskeletons are heavy and inefficient, which largely prevents them from being used in real life. Existing powered exoskeletons apply assistance to each wearer's joint separately, which requires many actuators and large batteries. In contrast, the powered exoskeletons created in this project will use bio-inspired actuation systems that concurrently assist multiple wearer’s joints, much like human muscles. Because one exoskeleton actuator assists multiple wearer’s joints, fewer actuators will be needed. Because energy is transferred between joints instead of being dissipated, smaller and lighter actuators and batteries will be needed. The multidisciplinary research team of roboticists, movement scientists, and clinicians will work closely with individuals with disabilities, broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education.

Ambulation requires considerable energy to accelerate and decelerate the limb segments and to dynamically support the body against gravity. Human ambulation is highly efficient and stable because of the passive dynamics of the leg and the elastic properties of the muscles, and also because many muscles span multiple joints, actively transferring energy between joints. In contrast, existing powered exoskeletons are designed and controlled considering each actuated joint as a separate unit, independent from the others, even when multiple joints are actuated. This approach disrupts the natural dynamics of ambulation, resulting in less efficient and less stable gait. The goal of this project is to address this fundamental gap by developing energy-conserving mechanisms and control algorithms inspired by human ambulation. We will optimize the energy exchange across multiple joints for the design and control of powered exoskeletons by studying how humans adapt to the assistance concurrently provided by a powered exoskeleton to multiple leg joints, on different anatomical planes, or during different ambulation activities. We will then design powered exoskeletons that can allow for energy transfer between different joints, conserving energy within the system, while improving metabolic cost, muscle effort, and stability of the wearer.

"This Future EcoManufacturing research grant will develop sustainable, self-morphing building blocks from the nano to macro scales inspired by the biological systems to devise novel manufacturing processes of highly efficient structures and components from centimeter to meter scale. These systems will be lightweight, yet ultrastrong, self-supportive, adaptive and energy efficient. Using common construction materials such as concrete, steel, aluminum, carbon fibers in constructing sustainable buildings, bridges, and other products involves a lot of construction waste and energy consumption. Polymers and their composites potentially offer strong and lightweight alternatives, however, none has matched the performance of steel and concrete. Natural materials are known for their lightweight yet astoundingly high strength, stiffness, and toughness, such as spider silk, dragonfly wings, and trees, where the intricate nano- and microarchitectures can prevail into meter scale. Inspired by natural materials, this project will develop new rules, new bio-based and bioinspired composite materials, and new eco-manufacturing methods to create low-cost, high-performance structural components for reuse, repurposing, and upcycling. It will bring researchers in architectural and structural designs, chemistry, physics, materials science, bio-, chemical and mechanical engineering, computation and economics together. It will also train an inclusive and responsible future Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) workforce and K-12 through curricula innovation, science demos, public exhibitions, workshop, and underrepresented minority outreach and internship. 

This Future EcoManufacturing research aims to bridge the nanometer- and meter-scale by addressing common questions in design and manufacturing, while overcoming existing challenges at the macroscale such as gravity versus internal structural forces. Several types of nano- and microstructured design elements will be manufactured from scalable bio-based and bioinspired composite materials with intrinsic anisotropy, followed by eco-construction via origami/kirigami engineering, modular assembly, and on-demand printing. By fine-tuning the material’s interfacial interactions to program the dynamic and active behaviors for reuse, repurpose and upcycling, and use of form-finding and topology optimization techniques, the project will achieve higher performance (e.g. lower weight, higher precision, high strength, novel wave-matter interactions) with fewer parts and reduced assembly. The project will involve four highly synergistic thrusts, including 1) multi-scaled design, modeling, prediction and optimization of stimuli-responsive structures at multi-scales, 2) assembly of anisotropic, responsive and high strength multi-materials at the nano-/microscale, 3) proof-of-concept, reduction-to-practice eco-manufacturing of materials developed in 2) into structures designed in 1), and 4) pushing the envelope to achieve additional performative function with reduced material via wave-matter engineering.  This Future Manufacturing research is supported by the Divisions of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (ENG/CMMI), Materials Research (MPS/DMR), Chemistry (MPS/CHE), Engineering Education and Centers (ENG/EEC), and the Division of Undergraduate Education (EHR/DUE).

"This project aims to increase the scalability of synthetic-biology debugging systems that could have broad applications in extending capabilities for cell-based sensors and actuators in medicine and agriculture, as well as for addition to new knowledge generation in molecular-biology research. This will be accomplished by building an end-to-end biomolecular-silicon hybrid system. Broadly, the resulting system will: (1) explore new ways to build hybrid bio-molecular silicon computer systems by integrating bio-molecular storage and computing with electronics, and (2) automate closed-loop synthetic biology design-build-test-learn processes. Importantly, this project will also train students and professionals in the intersection of biology and computing, which is a very promising new area of scientific and economic development. Results from this work will also be incorporated into new course materials at the intersection of embedded computing/fluidics, molecular biology and machine learning, with the goal of training students to quickly prototype ideas in molecular computing/synthetic biology.

The investigators will design and build scalable bio-molecular computing and debugging tools on top of a closed-loop system that integrates a nanopore sensor array for biomolecule-to-digital read-out (DNA and protein) with a DNA synthesizer for digital-to-biomolecule interface, automated with a digital/droplet microfluidic system and an integrated programming model (PurpleDrop+Puddle). The digital fluidics system will employ computer-vision techniques for reliable control of droplet movements. The investigators will develop machine-learning techniques to analyze raw nanopore sensor data for low-cost and high-throughput identification of molecular outputs. Specifically, the system will achieve two main objectives. The first objective will combine DNA synthesis and digital microfluidics for assembly of biological parts to implement automated cloning, in-line with DNA sequencing-based quality control. The second objective is transcriptional circuit auto-tuning, which will carry out automated characterization and parallel component debugging/tuning of designed in-vivo transcriptional circuits using a library of new genetic reporter proteins. For each objective, the nanopore sensor array will read-out the molecular results (DNA or protein); the control system (Puddle) will then interpret the data and determine the next fluidic manipulation actions as well as the production of additional synthetic DNA to guide the design or discovery process.

"This project is focused on the mathematical prediction of mechanical behavior in highly deformable elastic structures and solids, including both soft elastic systems and brittle materials.  Soft structures occur naturally in biological systems such as skin and bio-membranes and are also manufactured as thin films and elastomers.  The prediction of their initial instability, such as wrinkling, and post-critical pattern formation under loading and/or growth play a prominent role in this part of the project.  For brittle solids (such as ceramics or steels at low temperature), we will use a new approach to fracture, predicting the initiation and formation of cracks under incremental loading.  Overall, the project aims to provide new classes of continuum-mechanical models and novel approaches to their analyses, leading to a quantitative understanding of the mechanical behavior of these systems.  The work has a range of potential applications – from bio-molecular structures to engineering machines and structures.  This project includes opportunities for the research training of graduate students.
   
Classes of nonlinear models of elastic-surface structures, soft elastic solids, and brittle solids will be analyzed.  The main goals of the work are: (i) To provide properly formulated mechanics-based models.  (ii) To obtain rigorous mathematical results, viz., establish existence theorems – the only true way to “ensure that the mathematical description of a physical phenomenon is meaningful” (R. Courant).  (iii) To detect new phenomena.  Goals (i) and (ii) inform and enrich each other; goal (iii) is enabled by goals (i) and (ii).  This research is highly interdisciplinary, requiring tools and perspectives from several fields, e.g., nonlinear continuum mechanics, elliptic PDE systems, bifurcation theory, calculus of variations, numerical methods, symmetry ideas and biophysics, while providing new links between them.  The project will provide new results and insights pertaining to surface-creasing formation in soft elastic solids, fracture of brittle materials, post-critical growth in elastic solids and pattern formation in lipid-bilayer structures or bio-membranes.

"This project uses locomotion by lateral undulation in snakes as a model system for investigating how animals meet and prioritize mechanical and control demands, especially when these demands are constrained or conflicting. Terrestrial limbless locomotion, despite being used by almost 20% of terrestrial vertebrates, remains understudied. In lateral undulation, the most widespread and common mode of limbless locomotion, waves of bending pass down the body, pressing against structures in the environment (e.g. plants, rocks) to propel the snake forward. Lateral undulation poses several simultaneous challenges, including meeting mechanical power demands, overcoming the force of friction, and controlling forces at multiple, constantly shifting contact points. These demands may conflict; for example, the body posture that generates the most effective propulsive force from a contact point might reduce muscular force or power output. This project addresses how snakes handle this conflict and investigates whether mechanisms exist to mitigate or avoid potential tradeoffs, by testing animals in environments that impose different mechanical and control demands. This research will provide general insights into how animals manage competing demands during locomotion, particularly the need to simultaneously meet mechanical and control demands. Understanding limbless locomotion can also benefit snake-inspired robots, a target of bio-inspired robotics due to the exceptional ability of snakes to move through complex, cluttered, and confined spaces. In partnership with the University of Akron field station, the project also provides a unique outreach opportunity in bio-inspired robotics to nearby high schools serving economically disadvantaged youth, by leveraging a new type of feedback-based robotic programming based on stop-motion animation to eliminate the need for students to learn how to write code.

A central challenge of biomechanics is understanding how the physiological properties of muscle influence the movements of animals, often examined in specialized systems adapted to maximize a particular metric (e.g., power or cycle frequency). However, most animals must meet numerous independent mechanical and control demands simultaneously and can modulate their movements in a wide variety of ways to accomplish this. This project uses terrestrial lateral undulation in snakes as a model system to understand how animals meet these demands, particularly when the demands conflict. The friction-dominated mechanics of terrestrial limbless locomotion impose straightforward demands on mechanical force and power output, which will be directly measured from instrumented test arenas. The highly variable patterns of midline bending in snake locomotion suggest correspondingly variable muscle strain trajectories, which will be measured via fluoromicrometry. The multiple propulsive reaction forces depend upon local posture at each contact location. If both muscle mechanical output and control are determined by body kinematics, there is potential for conflict between these goals: control of reaction force orientation may compromise muscle mechanical outputs, and vice versa. This project involves a novel outreach program using a combination of live-animal demonstrations and robotics to provide students with a bio-inspired robotics design experience in which they observe a snake’s movements, hypothesize mechanisms, and test those mechanisms using snake-inspired robots. Two post-doctoral fellows and a graduate student will contribute to the research, thereby benefitting from interdisciplinary training and mentoring.

"With support from the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Dr. Gayan B. Wijeratne at the University of Alabama at Birmingham will investigate the chemistry of small molecules with heme iron centers such as the ones that activate oxygen in human biology. These model systems can be extremely versatile, yet straightforward probes for comprehending the complicated mechanistic details that govern oxygen mediated reactivities in biology. Dr. Wijeratne and his team will utilize these powerful tools in shedding light on yet unknown knowledge that can lead to pathways for efficient syntheses of complex molecules, and the discovery of catalysts that can enhance the efficiency of catalysts of oxygen reduction benefiting alternative energy applications. This work will involve bio-inspired design and synthesis of fresh model systems that combine organic and inorganic synthetic toolkits, and analyses of reactivities that draw parallels to biological functionalities. As well, a broad variety of cryogenic spectroscopic tools will be employed, offering a uniquely specialized skillset to contributing high-school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers. Outreach and educational aspects of this project will involve the orientation of Birmingham City high school students toward Regional Science Fair via a newly designed Science Club program. Proposed efforts will strive to bridge the gap of scientific literacy of youngsters in the City of Birmingham, which is one of the most income-segregated school districts in the country.   

Heme-containing dioxygenases play pivotal roles in human physiology, disease progression, and aging, consequently attracting substantial research interests within the past decade. However, exact mechanistic details concerning these are only faintly understood. Heme superoxide adducts are presumed to be active oxidants in heme dioxygenases, however, details pertaining to their definitive involvement in the actual enzymatic mechanism remain elusive. Synthetic model systems have long-served as powerful tools in addressing such mechanistic ambiguities, but synthetic heme superoxide adducts are often found to be sluggish oxidants. This anomaly calls for revaluation of explicit modeling of synthetic systems with direct relevance to their biological mode of action. Comprehension of mechanistic details of such model systems can also be of direct benefit for the design of superior synthetic methodologies targeting important complex organic molecules and homogeneous dioxygen reduction catalysts to be used in alternative energy applications. Proposed research will address this gap in knowledge by generating a library of synthetic heme superoxide model systems with divergent structural properties, and thorough investigation into how such structural modulations would influence their reactivity signatures. This work will vertically advance the fundamental understanding of reactivity-governing geometric, electronic, and non-covalent structural properties of mid-valent heme-oxygen intermediates, introducing a new era of heme-oxygen model chemistry. Outreach activities of this project will directly benefit the majority of underrepresented high schoolers in the Birmingham, Alabama area through cutting-edge research opportunities and high-quality one-on-one mentoring opportunities geared toward strengthening their preparatory phase for Regional Science Fair.

"With the support of the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor David Williams of Indiana University (IU-Bloomington) will develop new methods and strategies for the construction of complex, bio-active molecules.  These concepts are important for two principal reasons.  There is a need to devise more efficient procedures for the assembly of molecular complexity while finding environmentally benign reagents and reactions.  Secondly, there is need to expand the limits of structural chemistry to identify new scaffolds that are biologically active, both as a tools for chemical biology and as potential hit or even lead compounds for medicinal chemistry.  Multi-step synthesis pathways will be explored for the preparation of bio-active natural products; this project is especially focused on metal-catalyzed cyclization reactions of reactive compounds as a feature that may lead to the formation of two or more rings in a single reaction.  Educational aspects of this project are geared to broadly develop students as problem-solvers in the field of organic chemistry.  Most of the graduates from this laboratory experience are employed in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  Societal benefits will include the recruitment and participation of under-represented individuals and women in all aspects of the research.  Summer research opportunities will also be available for undergraduate participants in this research project. 

This research project seeks to forge new ground in synthetic methodology and particularly in strategies for cyclization reactions.  Transition metal-catalyzed reactions of strained cyclopropanes and cyclopropenes will be explored as a key element in the design of new pathways for the synthesis of complex, bio-active natural products.  The proposed activities are expected to advance knowledge regarding the synthesis of substituted cyclopropanes and the effective incorporation of these reactive building blocks into complex molecular architectures.  These investigations will also examine the propensity for reorganization of small ring metallacycles to form more stable pi-allyl metal intermediates in cyclization processes.  Project objectives seek to devise a reaction cascade concluding with intramolecular [3+2] and [2+2+1] cyclizations.  Studies are also planned on reaction scope and stereoselectivity through the examination of electronic and steric factors imposed by the catalyst and its ligands.  New synthesis strategies are proposed for the efficient  construction of tricyclic cyathanes and fusicoccanes, as well as for completion of the synthesis of daphnicyclidin A.   The project is a significant component of the Indiana University Department of Chemistry STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) commitment with an emphasis on access for women and underrepresented individuals through the IU ACS Bridging Program.  Broader scientific impacts are expected through planned collaborations with scientists in allied disciplines including biology, animal sciences, neuroscience and medicine.  Overall, this project aims to advance fundamental organic chemistry methodology and strategy and to provide a superior platform for student training in modern synthetic chemistry.

"Bacteriophages, the viral parasites of bacteria, are major agents of bacterial death in microbial communities or microbiomes. Previous work has shown that phage host range, the type of bacteria a given phage can successfully infect, can evolve rapidly. This evolution alters the impact that phage have on the composition and function of microbial communities. However, this previous work has focused on bacteria growing in well-mixed conditions while many bacteria in microbiomes exist in aggregations known as biofilms. In biofilms not only is the spatial arrangement of bacteria different, but also their physiology or lifestyle. In this project, which is a collaboration between researchers at the University of Minnesota (US), Dartmouth College (US) and the University of Exeter (UK), research will pair state of the art computer simulations with cutting edge experimental approaches to develop and test theory for predicting the impact that bacteriophage have on bacterial communities. This work will improve our ability to manage microbial communities that are vital for human health, agricultural production, and industrial applications. The project will help train the next generation of scientific leaders by working with postdoctoral researchers and graduate students to carry out the research. Additionally, it will develop teaching modules to engage high school students with the power of computational biology, preparing them to drive the bio-economy of the future.

Despite the abundance of phage and the prevalence of biofilm growth, little is known about the interaction between phage and biofilms. Specifically, there has been a paucity of investigation on how biofilms influence the evolution of phage host range. In addition to developing knowledge on a process that is critical to understanding microbiome behavior, the proposed work will also improve understanding of the evolution of generalist and specialist strategies more broadly. It will connect individual parasite movement to the dynamics of infection waves in heterogeneous environments. Additionally, it will quantify how host heterogeneity that arises from biotic and abiotic factors alters the evolution of parasite host range. The work will integrate a variety of models that span different length scales, with a powerful model system involving Escherichia coli and the bacteriophage T7. The research will develop and test theory to understand the impact of spatial organization, including the abundance of different hosts in a structured environment, the size of patches of hosts and the connectivity of these patches. The research will also develop and test theory to understand the consequences of bacterial matrix production, metabolic heterogeneity of hosts, and host mixing in biofilms.

"Facial expressions play a significant role in everyday communication among humans. Computer understanding of these complex and subtle expressions will lead to highly capable interactive cyber-human systems with proactive computers that make more appropriate responses to human interactions. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of investigators to address key challenges associated with spontaneous microexpression recognition in non-social scenarios. The project concentrates on generating bio-feedback from humans while learning skills, such as online learning, and being recorded and analyzed in continuous color and depth video streams. It will develop computer algorithms for human-machine synergy and test how this information can provide for superior learning when training applications are augmented with expression-informed bio-feedback in near real-time. This represents a significant step forward in training machines to recognize and classify facial microexpressions and maximizing the synergy of cyber-human systems that will improve the quality of life experiences. It will provide a computing environment within the reach of common people in which the interests or even the health of people can be detected and predicted, with significant impacts on skill learning, education and information retrieval.

The project develops an approach to the understanding of complex and subtle facial microexpressions and bio-feedback where the synergy between cyber and human systems can be fully exploited. It addresses key challenges associated with computational understanding and modeling of intelligence in challenging, realistic contexts. It uses assessment and intervention based on facial microexpressions to maximize synergy of cyber and human systems for skill learning. First, it considers deep learning and closed-loop video analysis for optimized skill learning in a reinforcement learning framework. Second, it develops novel representation of facial microexpressions from color and depth video streams and use them for person independent emotion recognition as well as person-specific emotions recognition when a learning task is adapted. Third, it exploits not only the color camera but also the integrated depth camera for precise measurements, which has not been used for microexpressions. The focus is to determine the extent to which real-time classification of microexpressions can provide for more appropriate interactivity that will facilitate human learning in real applications. The results will be broadly disseminated through a website that will have regular releases of databases and software tools by offering tutorials, workshops and demos at major professional meetings.

"Gene modification is a potential therapy to heal an injured human heart. Injured human hearts can create scarring, which may lead to negative cardiac remodeling and heart failure. In contrast, zebrafish hearts can fully regenerate even after severe injury. Interestingly, zebrafish cardiac genes are highly conserved in humans, i.e., they have remained essentially unchanged throughout evolution.  Thus, zebrafish is a genetically controllable model for studying heart regeneration. Despite intensive studies in zebrafish, a key regeneration process involved in proliferation of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) remains unclear. The goal of this project is to develop novel devices and optical systems to reveal the bio-electro-mechanical mechanisms that trigger cardiomyocyte proliferation during cardiac regeneration. Using an advanced flexible wireless ECG (electrocardiogram) jacket developed for zebrafish, the investigators will continuously monitor electrical conduction changes and evaluate the mechanical function during regeneration of the heart after injury. Advanced imaging will reveal the detailed molecular events and make it possible to measure biological changes along with the electrical and mechanical activity recorded via the jacket. This multidisciplinary project will provide a unique educational training experience for a diverse group of UT-Arlington’s undergraduate and graduate students. Furthermore, the undergraduate students’ names will be included on resultant publications to promote their passion of research involvement and to assist the students in their future professional endeavors. Outreach will continue by sharing research findings with local high schools through seminars or by providing a summer research opportunity.

The goal of this project is to elucidate an unrevealed bio-electro-mechanical mechanism that induces cardiomyocyte proliferation during cardiac regeneration by using novel micro-devices and optical systems. Although there are many reports about the molecular event of Notch signaling in cardiomyocyte proliferation after injury, the electromechanical aspect of promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that (a) Notch signaling is involved in cardiomyocyte proliferation after injury, and (b) Notch signaling is mechanosensitive and modulates cardiac electrical conduction.  Studies are designed to test the hypothesis that there is a closed feedback loop among mechanosensitive Notch signaling, cardiac electrical conduction, and contraction that induces expression of certain Msx homeobox genes to promote cardiomyocyte proliferation during adult zebrafish cardiac regeneration. The Research Plan is organized under three tasks.   The FIRST Task is to develop ECG acquisition and analysis from awake zebrafish during heart regeneration.  The “fish ECG jacket” with a wireless microelectrode array (MEA) of 4 gold electrodes and electronics will be fabricated on parylene C membranes that enable continuous ECG acquisition while minimizing irritation and discomfort to the fish during regeneration. The ECG data of multiple fish will be sent to a cloud system with integrated machine learning algorithms for data processing and ECG pattern recognition. The SECOND Task is to develop high resolution multi-view fusion with axially swept light-sheet based ultra-microscopy (MV-ASLUM) to image ligand dependent-Notch and its downstream Msx expressions.  MV-ASLUM will be integrated with a tissue clearing technique (CLARITY) to image in toto adult zebrafish hearts without physical sectioning. The THIRD Task is to modulate cardiac contractility and Notch signaling to regulate cardiomyocyte proliferation during regeneration via Msx expression. The Tg(hsp70:DN-MAML) zebrafish line and the CRISPR/CAS9 technique will be used to silence Notch and therefore inhibit Msx gene expression and cardiomyocyte proliferation and thereby verify the relationship between Notch inducing Msx gene expression and cardiac regeneration via cardiomyocyte proliferation. Contractility regulatory drugs (metoprolol, BDM, and isoproterenol) will be used to test the relationship of Notch inducible Msx gene expression during the regeneration process and nanoparticle (NP) targeted delivery will be used to overexpress Msx gene expression for regeneration after pharmacologically weakened cardiac contraction. This collaborative micro-device and biomedical imaging approach meets at the intersection of bio-electro-mechanics and cardiomyocyte proliferation during regeneration with a pathophysiological significance to molecular events and protection from myocardial infarction.

"Marine phytoplankton (microscopic photosynthetic algae) produce about half of the oxygen we breath and remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year. This primary productivity plays a central role in controlling atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO2) levels and the global climate. Yet, phytoplankton productivity is limited by lack of iron (an essential trace element) in about 40% of the global ocean. While phytoplankton productivity helps remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it also removes iron and other essential trace elements (like manganese, cobalt, copper, and zinc) from the upper ocean. One critical issue is, “What are the sources for these essential trace elements that are needed to replace those removed by phytoplankton to keep the annual productivity cycles going?” This is especially important in the waters of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, where ocean circulation brings deep water to the surface; water that is enriched in nutrients like nitrate and phosphate but depleted in essential trace elements. The main source for iron in the open ocean is from desert dust deposition.   In this project, scientists will collect aerosols (fine particles in the air) and rain samples over the Southern Ocean to measure how much iron (and the other essential trace elements) is depositing to surface waters. Other scientists will be measuring how fast phytoplankton are growing, and together we will learn how the input of trace elements from dust helps to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This information can then be used to help predict the future of Earth’s climate.  The scientists will communicate results of their study to the public via open house events at their respective campuses, as well as through online forums.  One undergraduate student from Florida International University, a leading minority serving university, would be supported and trained as part of this project.  

The project will measure the aerosol fractional solubility and atmospheric deposition of bio-essential trace elements as part of a multidisciplinary project studying trace element sources, transformations and sinks in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean. The research cruise track will cross the currents and oceanographic fronts that are major pathways of the general circulation in the region where we expect to find multiple possible aerosol sources, and where aerosol Fe deposition and rainfall rates are predicted to range over 1-2 orders of magnitude. Aerosol samples (bulk and size-fractionated) will be collected on a daily basis and event-based rain samples to be analyzed for total and soluble major and trace elements including nitrate, phosphate, silicate, chloride, sulfate, Na, Mg, Al, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cd. In addition, scientists will analyze the water-soluble organic compounds in aerosols, focusing on compounds such as oxalate and methane-sulfonic acid (MSA) that enhance aerosol trace element solubility. Scientists will use Be-7 concentrations in aerosols and the upper water column to calculate aerosol bulk deposition velocities and test whether the relationship between rainfall rate and bulk deposition velocity that we have previously published can be applied on a more global basis. Further, scientists will use the trace element concentration data along with air-mass back trajectory analysis to apportion the aerosols between anthropogenic and natural sources, and study how aerosol sources affect the fractional solubility. Aerosol and rain subsamples will be provided to collaborators on the cruise for the analysis of additional important parameters.

"Nontechnical Summary: Shear flow is widely present in physiological environments and contributes significantly to various normal and pathological processes, especially in the circulatory system. Consequently, biomaterials with structure and function tunable by shear represent powerful tools to detect and rectify pathological processes induced by abnormal flows in the body. For the past few decades, shear-responsive hydrogels and molecular assemblies have been widely explored. However, single-biomolecule based shear responders remains a poorly-tapped subject, despite such materials could better mimic natural functions in circulation, delivering more accurate spatial and temporal responses with function reversibility. This project will design and characterize novel Single-MOlecule based materials with switchable structures and functions REsponsive to Shear flows (SMORES). Owing to the modular design, the material concept can be generalized to other constructs capable of responding to abnormal flows in the circulatory system towards novel diagnostics and therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases in the long term. This project will provide fundamental insights into biomechanics of polymer devices under the influence of ligands and the flow environment, perspectives that have not been studied in depth before. Rational design of biomaterials containing both bio- and nonbio- functionalities to achieve predictable flow responses will advance the fields of materials science, biomechanics, bio-conjugation, molecular engineering and bio-transport. Knowledge from this work will enable new diagnostics and theranostics for hemostatic applications, advancing the national health. The PIs will actively recruit underrepresented students to their research and disseminated discoveries from the research broadly to the general public through various K12 outreach programs.

Technical Summary: The design is inspired by a coagulation molecule in circulation, the von Willebrand Factor (vWF), which executes its function of crosslinking platelets to damaged blood vessel wall at shear rates > 5,000 per sec. The function is switched on by conformational changes under high shear and is enabled by an extremely complicated molecular structure: vWF is comprised of tens to hundreds of monomer units, each of which contains more than ten domains. To demonstrate that an artificial material of modular design could achieve a similar function to vWF, i.e. binding cells at high shear, we propose the construction SMORES to inhibit or promote the cell binding activity of the vWF’s platelet binding domain under shear control. Shear dependent cell binding to the proposed material will be characterized and correlated with molecular conformations studied by single-molecular force spectroscopy, microfluidic imaging experiments and computer modeling. Besides demonstrating the material design concept, the proposed work will emphasize fundamental studies of single-molecule biomechanical behaviors in different biochemical environment, especially the presence and absence of ligands.

"Quantum systems enable some of the most accurate measurements known to man. For example, modern atomic clocks measure time with an accuracy exceeding one second over the age of the universe. Recently, a new class of room temperature, solid state, quantum systems emerged that utilize similar quantum measurement concepts, but measure magnetic fields rather than time. In principle, these quantum sensors based on crystallographic defects in diamond could enable the detection of tiny magnetic fields created by nuclear spins in an individual molecule. Such a measurement could provide important insights into complex molecular biological processes at the level of individual molecules with atomic resolution. Although powerful, current quantum technologies lack the sensitivity and biophysical tools to probe biological systems in a single-molecule regime. To overcome these limitations, this project relies on a novel, interdisciplinary approach that combines research in physics, computer science, materials science, and biophysics. The ability to probe biological systems in such a new regime would be of far reaching consequences to fundamental biological research. At the same time the concepts developed in this project will pave the way to a new generation of biomedical devices based on quantum sensing that could significantly simplify sample preparation and enable high throughput screening at a fraction of today's cost. In parallel, this research project will also contribute to training a new workforce in quantum engineering through the development of new course materials, the establishment of conferences that access the interdisciplinary aspects of quantum sensing, and the creation of workshops that enable scientists from all over the world to get hands-on training in the quantum technologies. 

This collaborative, interdisciplinary effort develops quantum sensing capabilities for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of small ensembles and individual biomolecules. Sensing based on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond enabled the detection of nuclear spins in single proteins and basic NMR spectra. However, these experiments are unable to provide biological information, require days of data acquisition, and are limited to denatured proteins. Applications to intact proteins remain an open challenge due to limitations in quantum sensing methodology, a lack of single-molecule techniques, and imperfections in diamond material engineering. This project investigates fundamental mechanisms and the engineering of systems that overcome these limitations. Specific objectives include: (1) Theoretical exploration of the fundamental limits in single-molecule NMR, (2) Investigation of quantum metrological protocols for single-molecule NMR, (3) Spectroscopic study of diamond surfaces and their functionalization, and (4) Engineering of a single-molecule platform for quantum sensing devices. Goal 1 employs theoretical methods to investigate the limits of single-molecule NMR in the context of multi-parameter sensing under decoherence. Goal 2 develops and benchmarks single-molecule NMR protocols by combining classical signal processing and experimental quantum control. Goal 3 relies on materials science techniques and quantum sensing to understand the origin of decoherence in shallow NV centers. Goal 4 combines methods from single-molecule biophysics and diamond-based NMR spectroscopy for the development of a bio quantum sensor interface. The project will advance understanding of quantum sensing at the intersection of quantum information, engineering, and biology. This will lead to the development and characterization of new computational protocols and devices for single-molecule NMR sensing. 

This project is jointly funded by Quantum Leap Big Idea Program, the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, and the Office of International Science and Engineering.

"Room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) lubricants derived from bio-based feedstock are environmentally benign and can offer lubrication performance superior to that of petroleum-based lubricants. However, the broad application of RTILs has been limited by the lack of a fundamental understanding of their lubrication mechanisms. Importantly, the ability of RTILs to provide adequate lubrication is determined by the preferential adsorption of RTILs on the surfaces of machine components, which in turn is affected by the interplay between surface roughness and RTIL size and structure. It is expected that, by changing the molecular structure of RTILs, the desired adsorption layer can be engineered on a given surface. This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award will support the modeling and experimental research needed to achieve this goal. The project brings together PIs from academia with experience in tribology and tribocorrosion, biofuel and biochemical synthesis, molecular-scale simulation, and materials characterization with an industrial partner who will evaluate the RTILs in machine components and develop commercialization plans. Together, the team will achieve a new understanding of the lubrication mechanisms of RTILs that will enable design and manufacturing of bio-based lubricants with superior performance that are viable alternatives to petroleum-based products. The new RTILs will benefit industry, increasing national competitiveness, as well as society by enabling a cleaner, healthier environment. In parallel, this project will provide interdisciplinary education, research, and training opportunities for the next generation of engineers and scientists in both academic and industrial settings. 

The goal of this integrated experimental and computational project is to understand the mechanisms of RTIL lubrication for sliding surfaces with variable roughness and topography to enable design of sustainable lubricants from bio-based feedstock. The RTILs will be evaluated in terms of both their performance as lubricants and their biodegradability. Through this fundamental study, the following key scientific questions will be answered: (1) How do RTILs adsorb (form lubricating layers) on surfaces of varying roughness? (2) What tribological (friction and wear) and tribocorrosive (synergistic wear-corrosion) mechanisms are exhibited by RTIL-lubricated surfaces of varying roughness? (3) How do changes in surface topography influence RTIL lubrication mechanisms? (4) What is the role of molecular structure in the biodegradability of RTILs? Answering these questions will provide the foundational knowledge needed to overcome the current barriers to adopting RTILs as lubricants in industrial settings. This research will contribute to: (a) an in-depth understanding of the interplay between electrochemical and mechanical processes that affect material and lubricant degradation; (b) design criteria for RTIL-lubricated systems with improved tribocorrosion resistance; and (c) environmentally benign RTILs that can ultimately replace existing petroleum-based lubricants.

"Social interaction is a complex and highly demanding task -- it can unfold in a harmonious and effortless way, yet sometimes also fail catastrophically. A critical determinant of success is whether or not the partners are able to establish rapport. Rapport impacts all communication contexts, from initial contact formation to private conflict resolution and business negotiations. While humans are sensitive to flaws in rapport, they frequently fail to identify the reasons or take counter measures. This project is motivated by the idea that new media technologies, such as social virtual reality (VR), can augment people's social-cognitive capacities in this regard and improve our communication skills in daily life interactions.  In relevant respects, machine capabilities can be superior to, and less biased than, human social perception. On the one hand, interactions taking place in VR allow the system to register behavioral details affecting rapport (such as movement, eye gaze, and facial expressions). Moreover, mobile sensor technologies can be seamlessly integrated into VR devices, such as headsets or controllers to measure the neurophysiological correlates of emotional, motivational, and attentional attunement. On the other hand computational power now allows us to run highly complex machine learning algorithms on standard personal computers. This project will leverage VR capture technologies, mobile neurophysiological sensing and deep learning methods to develop a bio-behavioral model of rapport. Based on this the project will develop and evaluate tools to monitor rapport in ongoing interactions and administer feedback to enable corrective actions that improve rapport. 

The investigators will meet the two objectives. First, they will accumulate an annotated interaction database consisting of 150 dyads (pairs of subjects in conversation) performing three different interaction tasks, with an overall duration of 30 minutes. The database will include speech, movement, gaze, EEG measures of concurrent brain activity, and cardiovascular measures. The interaction protocols will be annotated for rapport by groups of observers, and the subjects themselves will evaluate interaction quality and outcomes. Second, they will develop and validate machine learning algorithms that identify bio-behavioral rapport signatures in the annotated multichannel database, and predict perceived rapport and physiological responses from nonverbal behavior. This development will lead to a bio-behavioral model of rapport, which provides the basis for social AI components, capable of monitoring and facilitating rapport in ongoing avatar interactions. Long term goals are to integrate these tools in communication media beyond social VR or in real life interactions, depending on more advanced, portable and unobtrusive sensing devices.

"The ability to send and receive information from inside the body is of key importance for scientific and medical applications. Nearly all implantable electronics devices require communication with the external world to be able to transmit acquired bio-signals for analysis or receive instructions from external devices to modulate their interactions with tissue. However, this task is inherently challenging because the communication method should be (i) non-invasive, meaning no components extruding through tissue, (ii) low-power, to be able to acquire data continuously over an extended period of time (iii) high-speed, to allow transmission of complex biological data acquired, (iv) controllable, to allow communication over a defined depth in the tissue. The overall objective of this work is to develop an ion-based, high-speed communication scheme to enable non-invasive and safe transmission of signals without the need of components that extrude through tissue. The rationale for the proposed work is that ions in biological tissue can be used to transfer information at high speeds and low power to the outside of body. The educational goal of the project is to provide hands-on experience for students by developing fully bio-compatible and inexpensive devices for ionic communication. The proposed research is expected to not only advance the field of bioelectronics by improving understanding of key principles governing communication across the body, but also result in positive impact to society at large. 

To understand and modulate physiologic functions, implantable bioelectronic devices should be capable of safely communicating the high spatiotemporal resolution bio-signals with high speed and low power consumption to devices located outside the body. This communication and data transfer should be accomplished through a non-invasive path with no elements that extrude through tissue to minimize discomfort, mobility complications, and risk of tissue damage or infection. Ionic communication, which leverages the ion-rich nature of biological tissue to transmit signals through intact surfaces, could fulfill these requirements and address the limitations of current electronic charge carrier-based approaches. However, there is a clear lack of knowledge regarding how to use ionic communication to establish a high speed, low-power, and biocompatible communication medium across biological tissue. The objective of the proposed research is to combine optimal properties for an abiotic/biotic transmission interface: biocompatibility, conformability, miniaturization, low power consumption, efficient interaction with the body’s ionic signals, and ability to transmit data at speeds relevant to electrophysiological processes. Specific aims for the project are: (1) establish the physical, material and geometrical requirements to enable ionic communication; and (2) define the physical parameters that govern the spatial propagation of ionic signals through tissue. Overall, ionic communication could result in significant medical and social benefits by simplifying data transmission from bioelectronic devices and enabling application to situations in which use of transcutaneous connectors or bulky implanted electronics is prohibitive.

"The Board on Life Sciences (BLS) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine serves as the Academies' focal point for a wide range of technical and policy topics in the life sciences. These include developments in genetics, including synthetic biology and ""gene drives""; the biology of organisms and ecosystems and the conservation of biodiversity; biosafety and biosecurity; and basic biomedical research. BLS organizes and oversees studies that provide advice to the government and the scientific community on the life sciences and their impacts on society as well as on the improvement of biology education and the maintenance of a robust life sciences workforce. Throughout its 35-year history, BLS has produced numerous reports that have had major impacts on science and policy. Detailed information on BLS's many reports may be found at http://dels.nas.edu/bls/. For BLS to continue to produce significant results for the government, the scientific community, and the public, it is necessary to have ""core support"" so that BLS can carry out important basic functions: holding two meetings of its advisory board per year; allowing BLS to explore emerging areas of biological science and technology to monitor significant new scientific advances; and supporting the staff in their efforts to develop new study ideas and disseminate information about completed reports. The NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences also has interests in fostering the welfare of the life sciences community and promoting the highest quality research throughout the life sciences. Over the years, BLS has provided substantial support to NSF-BIO through the preparation of expert reports that have complemented NSF-supported research to advance the frontiers of biological knowledge, increase understanding of complex biological systems, and provide a theoretical basis for life sciences research. Core support for BLS is an investment that can provide returns across a wide range of NSF's biological science research.

The purpose of this project is to acquire general (""core"") support for the National Academies' Board on Life Sciences (BLS). This support will allow BLS to continue to hold two Board meetings per year; use various means (e.g., webinars, guest speaker seminars, planning meetings, etc.) to monitor and explore leading edge topics in the life sciences; and develop ideas for new studies and perform tasks, such as dissemination of completed studies, for which no project funds are available. Over its 35-year history, BLS has produced a large number of high impact study reports as well as conducting other activities with influential results. Some of these have provided impetus for the initiation of new science projects (e.g., sequencing the human genome), advancing new fields of science (metagenomics, glycoscience), fostering new methods of teaching biology (BIO 2010 and its follow on Summer Institutes), and reinforcing or affirming the value of both new and existing facilities and infrastructure (e.g. field stations and marine laboratories). BLS reports have resulted in the establishment of new funding programs or amplifications or directional shifts in existing programs; produced organizational change in funding agencies or research plans; highlighted new research areas or important issues that subsequently received greater emphasis; or established new policies that were adhered to by the scientific community or by funding agencies. Studies prepared specifically for the NSF Biology directorate by BLS have helped inform the Congress to about major investments like the National Ecological Observatory Network, provided two successive five-year plans for the National Plant Genome Initiative, and inspired research in new areas, such as metagenomics and theoretical biological research. BLS reports have also provided suggestions for ensuring the future of field stations and marine labs, and a current study to helping to chart a more sustainable future for biological collections. Because of the convening power of the Academies, BLS is able to access the best scientific minds to contribute to its projects and achieve their goals. Core support from NSF helps allow the Board members and staff to plan and execute studies to assist the Foundation and others with program planning, analysis, and assessment.

"The broader impact of this I-Corps project is to develop an alternative source of renewable energy and chemicals to help address the worldwide increasing demands for energy. It will provide a new and abundant source of renewable energy and chemical intermediates with long-term effects. Development of these platform chemicals from renewable cheaper resources, such as waste crops, can impact the economics of the chemical industry by leveraging new starting materials. Technology breakthroughs from this work will enable broader adoption of bio-based products.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of technology for production of platform chemicals using a catalytic membrane reactor. The technology focuses on simultaneous catalytic hydrolysis, dehydration, and rehydration of renewable biomass to bio-based platform chemicals and biofuels. The feed used in this technology is lignocellulosic biomass instead of conventional monomers as starting materials accounting for significant feedstock cost reduction. The competitive thermochemical and enzyme-based technology have major disadvantages such as high energy demand, high cost of enzymes, and involves multiple complex processing steps. Further, comparative chemical conversion processes use corrosive acids or expensive ionic liquids which are unacceptable with present day industrial norms. The technology uses non-toxic, inexpensive, robust, and easily regenerable enzyme-mimicked catalyst efficiently catalyzes multiple reactions with high desired product yield using carefully selected solvent system. Furthermore, the proposed technology is intensified using membrane process that helps in simultaneous catalysis and separation of the products shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium preventing product decomposition. Previous fundamental research has shown that the proposed catalytic membrane can convert both cellulose and hemicellulose part of the biomass, which opens the possibility of future developments that focus on production of multiple other products.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a platform technology for discovering molecular glues. Many illnesses, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, and neurological diseases, can be treated by controlling the activity or abundance of specific proteins in the cell. However, many proteins cannot be targeted by traditional drugs. Instead, pharmaceutical companies are now using a new strategy to hijack the cell’s native quality control pathways and degrade proteins to control their abundance rather than their activity. This approach has been validated as a powerful therapeutic strategy, but significant challenges remain for discovering molecular glues. The proposed platform for molecular glue discovery is expected to have a major commercial and societal impact by conducting high-throughput screening. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to advance the development of a novel platform for discovering molecular glues, or drugs that function by agonizing protein-protein interactions. This platform combines the throughput of a cell-based assay with the accuracy of a bioanalytical technique by linking yeast haploid mating efficiency to the affinity of proteins displayed on the cells' surfaces. Initial results demonstrate that next generation sequencing of diploid cells can be used to simultaneously measure the affinity of many protein-protein interactions with high accuracy and correctly determine the effect of well-characterized small molecules that inhibit or enhance particular protein-protein interactions. Additionally, the platform is functional in a 96-well plate format, which is important for compatibility with standard high-throughput screening workflows. The primary goals of this project are to improve the sensitivity of the platform for the detection of molecular glues that induce a weak protein-protein interaction, reduce the per-well screening cost by improving assay efficiency, and incorporate new proteins into the platform and validate their function with existing small-molecules.

"The functional molecules in cells are proteins - the expression, activity and interactions of particular proteins in any given cell define its structure and what it is capable of doing. The technologies used to study proteins on a large scale are collectively called proteomics. The main method used in proteomics is mass spectrometry (MS), which can calculate the molecular weight and abundance of molecules. The majority of proteomics workflows perform a step of protein digestion prior to MS. The result of digestion is that all the proteins become broken up into small chains, called peptides. This step has become common, because peptides are easier to analyse by MS, due to their lower mass, producing simpler data to interpret. One challenge in this digestion step is that some proteins break down quickly whereas for others digestion is incomplete, producing unreliable quantification data that are not fully understood or compensated for by current analysis software. To overcome this problem, the University of Texas Anderson Cancer Center will collaborate with the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom to develop an integrated suite of analysis techniques using a powerful statistical technique called Bayesian modelling. These advances will be incorporated into a freely available software suite.
  
Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) coupled to Liquid Chromatography (LC) is the primary technique used in proteomics. The most common approach is LC separation of tryptic fragments derived from a proteome digestion, followed by tandem MS of the peptides. This entire workflow is conceived as a series of discrete steps, some chemical, some instrumental, some informatics and some statistical. Existing software concentrates on subcomponents of the workflow, and comprise a series of deterministic, self-contained steps. This project will translate the whole protein quantification pipeline into a rigorous statistical framework underpinned by Bayesian methodology. The new framework will integrate evidence across all experimentally acquired datasets, and borrow strength from unused structure within a proteomics workflow, including digestion dynamics. The proposed pipeline consists of three synergistic developments (1) Utilization of all unidentified (peptide) features, as well as identified features, to infer the most likely mixture of proteins present in a sample; (2) Differential quantification of complex mixtures of known proteoforms; (3) Discovery of unknown proteoforms and all modifications (PTMs) carried by their quantification signatures. These advancements will elicit a step-change in quantification sensitivity and interpretation at the proteoform level for the first time. The end-to-end analysis solution will be made available within the user-centric standards compliant ProteoSuite package, and as a Galaxy workflow for high-throughput pipelines.","Philadelphia","University of Pennsylvania","47.074","98079","ADVANCES IN BIO INFORMATICS","2016487","jeffrey.morris@pennmedicine.upenn.edu","Jeffrey","Morris","02/25/2020","09/01/2019","08/31/2020","Bilateral BBSRC-NSF/BIO: Bayesian Quantitative Proteomics","BIO"
"The National Academy of Engineering identified advancing personalized learning as one of its 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering. To make progress on this challenge, a research team with expertise in cognitive and learning sciences, physics education, computer systems, bio-sensing, and machine learning will work together to bring advanced data acquisition and processing technologies to support rapid testing and evaluation of cognitive and learning science hypotheses. The project will use a convergent approach to advance the study of active learning and the role of stress in classes using active learning in introductory physics. The effort is centered on two objectives. The first is to develop technology to build a flexible framework for creating instruments to measure stress for use in introductory college physics. The second is to pilot studies to develop a joint cognitive and learning science-based understanding of the role of stress and the mechanisms for learning in the context of multi-perspective conversations (MPCs) among students in introductory physics. While MPCs are known to play an important role in developing conceptual understanding in disciplines such as physics, little is understood concerning the impact of stimulation and stress during MPCs. Because dozens of MPCs occur simultaneously in a classroom, they are challenging to record and study. The automated transcript and machine learning tools developed by this project will allow for the collection and study of significantly more conversations. Cognitive science lab experiments using advanced bio-sensors will study stress and learning initially in a controlled setting. Subsequent blending of biosensor and audio/video data will allow the issues of stress and learning to be studied for the first time in a larger classroom environment. One of the key broader outcomes of the project will be the construction of an interdisciplinary convergent team. Activities will focus around building shared vocabulary, cross-disciplinary meetings, public workshops and the training of future convergent researchers through graduate courses and participation in this project. The award is supported by funding from OIA, EHR, ENG, and SBE. 

The technology development efforts are divided into two aspects each with an interdisciplinary team of cognitive scientists, learning scientists and engineers. The Aspect I research team will develop advanced bio-sensors to measure stress through unobtrusive wearable patches and classroom cortisol sensors. These sensors will be used in the cognitive science lab to study the effects of stress in learning by measuring attention, immediate memory, and the ability to construct knowledge schemas. In Aspect II, machine learning methods based on topological data analysis will be developed that combine audio/video recording and the biosensors data to allow learning and cognitive scientists to study active learning environments at scale. The focus of these pilot efforts will be on the study of multi-perspective conversations (MPCs) in an introductory physics classroom. Flexible framework for instrumenting learning environments, complete with stress sensors and automated transcripts and machine learning tools, will be tested first with a small number of concurrent MPCs and then later at classroom scale. Researchers will verify the technology and begin investigating the relationship between MPC and learning outcomes, the conditions that foster MPCs between students, and the role of stress in shaping cognitive processes underlying MPCs. The thread-based sensors will use novel materials and are non-obtrusive and wearable and wireless. The use of topological data analysis (TDA) will provide a flexible machine learning framework that can grow and adapt both with the size of the data sets and their heterogeneity. These technologies will be integrated and deployed in a classroom-scale system by computer systems researchers.

"The transportation sector of the U.S. economy generates a large portion of greenhouse gas emissions. Increased use of renewable fuels is one option to reduce transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions and also to secure domestic, sustainable resources for fuel. One promising strategy to help meet transport needs is to synthesize transportation-grade fuels (e.g. liquid hydrocarbons) from biomass waste using renewable electricity, thereby enabling a CO2-neutral fuel source. Bio-oil hydrogenation is known to be the most capital- and energy-intensive steps for biofuel production. One promising approach to address this challenge is to use electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of biomass because it provides a sustainable method of fuel production and enables the use of renewable electricity. However, improved electrochemical systems and electrocatalysts are needed to make ECH economically competitive. This fundamental research project will address energy efficiency, product yield challenges, and economic analysis of ECH. The project will focus on the molecular pathways and reaction bottlenecks for hydrogenation reactions on metals in the aqueous phase. The research project will provide multidisciplinary training to two PhD students at the University of Michigan and enable them to conduct cutting-edge research in materials synthesis and characterization, computational modeling, and electrocatalysis. Underrepresented minority and female students will be engaged in research and outreach at both the high school and undergraduate level. 

This fundamental research project will focus on the hypothesis-directed study of electrochemical hydrogenation reactions on platinum group metals and bimetallic alloys in aqueous phase. The research will advance knowledge of metals and bimetallic alloys for use in selective hydrogenation of biomass waste using renewable electricity for sustainable fuel production. The project's goal is to help engender the widespread use of electrocatalytic hydrogenation by focusing on three main areas, the adsorption of organics and hydrogen on metal surfaces, electrocatalytic hydrogenation rates on metals and bimetallics, and using a combination of theory and experiment to understand the link between adsorption and reaction rates and selectivity to predict more active and selective alloys. The team will measure and compute intrinsic reaction rates under controlled conditions on different metals, and then find correlations with adsorption energies and reaction intermediates. The project?s guiding hypothesis is that by starting with metals having moderate activity for hydrogenation and modifying to create bimetallics (e.g., Pt-alloys), one can tune the oxygenated aromatic and hydrogen adsorption energies to increase reaction rates and energy efficiency. To probe the reaction pathway and intermediates, the project will measure adsorption isotherms and use surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy under reaction conditions to selectively probe species near the electrocatalyst surface. To complement the experimental work, the project includes density functional theory modeling of hydrogen and oxygenated aromatic adsorption energies and ECH activity at applied potentials in water. Fundamental knowledge will result of molecular-level reaction mechanisms for electrocatalytic hydrogenation systems.

"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will focus on cultivating a deep understanding of the intelligent morphology of flying insects to guide better engineering designs for flying robots.  Intelligent morphology is the concept that natural structures have evolved to reduce the energetic and neurological inputs required to control them. Insects are masterful at exploiting intelligent morphology, utilizing their body's flexibility to interact effortlessly with their environments.   This enables them to perform complex tasks using a small fraction of the energy and cognitive power available to other animals. By contrast, many engineered systems continue to employ rigid components which relegate little function to passive mechanisms.  This limits their energy efficiency, increases controller complexity and reduces their capacity to adapt to dynamic environments.  Using the insect model, this project will generate methodologies that incorporate intelligent morphology design principles into engineered systems, which in turn can enhance their performance and durability.  Concurrently, this award will support the training of future engineers in the fields of dynamics and vibrations through a state-of-the-art Applied Dynamics educational laboratory.   The Applied Dynamics educational laboratory will also host annual week-long workshops focused on teaching the fundamentals of vibrations to rural middle school students who currently have limited access to science programs, as well as other students from underrepresented groups.  Current research topics will be integrated into these educational activities.  


This program aims to develop a data driven system-level model of the insect flight mechanism that is comprised of the following components: the insect wing, abdomen, thorax, wing hinge and wing costal break.  The project focuses on the latter three.  Data collected from dynamical experiments on actual insects will drive component model formulation, and benchtop experimental systems representative of each component will be constructed in order to study biological phenomena in a controlled environment.  Through this integrative approach of analytical modeling, biological testing and benchtop experimentation, this research will demonstrate how (1) the flexible insect thorax minimizes the energetic costs of locomotion, (2) the wing hinge simplifies flight control, and (3) wing buckling enhances insect collision robustness.  Derived models will be reduced order to facilitate parametric studies and will account for complex phenomena associated with viscoelasticity and nonlinearity.   Such models can easily be extended to inform bio-inspired technologies such as flapping wing micro air vehicles and flapping airfoil energy harvesters.  This project contributes to the Principle Investigator’s long-term goal of elucidating the fundamental nature of intelligent morphology in complex biological systems.

"This grant supports research on a manufacturing technique for the scalable production of drugs based on biological nanoparticles, promoting the progress of science, advancing national prosperity and improving human health. The research involves fabricating a new class of miniature devices called microhydrocyclones using a three-dimensional printing process.  Three-dimensional printing or additive manufacturing is used to create three-dimensional structures with exceptionally high resolution, resulting in features one thousand times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. Microhydrocyclones are microfluidic devices that permit the rapid isolation or separation of biological nanoparticles called exosomes. Exosomes have emerged as highly promising vehicles for targeted drug delivery in personalized medicine. But existing processing methods are too slow to support effective and high throughput drug development. This project is a fundamental study in the manufacture of high-performance microhydrocyclone devices and their application in high throughput exosome separation and collection. The research bridges the fields of manufacturing, microsystems technology and bioengineering. The results of this effort have broad impacts beyond drug development where rapid nanoparticle separations are needed, including the chemical, energy, and biomedical industries, which benefits the U.S. economy. The project expands participation of underrepresented groups and women and introduces K-12 students to research for a positive impact on engineering education.

Exosomes are cell-secreted bio-nanoparticles. Exosomes offer enormous potential for targeted nanotherapeutic delivery, but improved isolation techniques are needed to provide the required processing throughput for drug development. This research studies a novel microhydrocyclone technology, which is capable of increasing the throughput of exosome separations by orders of magnitude over existing methods. The microhydrocyclone design is guided by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling.  The team develops and validates an analytical scaling model of the miniature hydrocyclone separation process. It leverages nanoscale laser direct writing to integrate functional microhydrocyclone devices within thermoplastic microfluidic substrates. A multi-element bandpass concentrator design is developed for size-selective exosome collection. To reduce risk, several features are added to the device such as coating with silica to make it leak-free. The performance of the technology for continuous-flow isolation of exosomes from cell culture supernatant is assessed.

"With the rapid spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide, highly-protective respirator masks can be crucial to safeguard the uninfected population. While virus transmission occurs via tiny aerosols, current mask coverings rely purely on passive filters; and can benefit from enhanced aerosol-collection and virus-inactivation mechanisms. We propose to engineer a highly-efficient, easy-to-use, cost-effective respirator design that will be significantly more efficient at capturing tiny aerosols. A combination of copper-based filters and an air-transmission passage inspired by nasal structures in animals with an enhanced sense of smell will facilitate droplet capture, followed by virus inactivation via thermal and ionic effects. The final respirator design will directly address the urgent global shortage and immediate national need for more effective masks. By preventing nosocomial transmission, the product can also be a critical game-changer for the healthcare community. For an accelerated concept-to-product transition, we will seek collaborations with virology labs and pharmaceutical companies for detailed testing with live COVID samples.

This collaborative project will engineer a novel, highly-efficient, virus-preventive respirator mask inspired by nasal structures in animals with enhanced olfactory sensitivity. Small aerosol droplets that can carry viruses will be captured from inhaled air by using a combination of copper-based filters and a bio-inspired tortuous passage with periodic thermal gradients induced by spiral copper wires. The aerosol capture will be articulated by modulating the dynamics of flow structures in the convoluted geometry (vortex trap) and by thermophoresis action along the respirator’s internal walls (thermal trap). Cyclic cold/hot temperature changes on the walls, along with ionic activity from the copper material, will be used to inactivate the trapped viruses. The use of these mechanisms is supported by published observations on earlier and current strains of coronavirus. The project will integrate the theoretical, experimental, and computational expertise of the principal investigators in optimizing the design for a new-age respirator, which can be radically more effective at preventing the transmission of COVID-19. To meet the urgent public need, the researchers will establish collaborations with pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies as well as university-based Biosafety Level – 3 lab units for non-clinical in vivo testing and to ensure rapid prototype development of the proposed respirator masks.

"Within the framework of ""Sustainable Engineering for the Next Millennium"" established by the National Science Foundation (NSF) the vision of the proposed Engineering Research Center (ERC) is to unravel the mystery of natural rubber (NR) biosynthesis, the last ""holy grail"" of rubber science and technology. Plastic and rubber waste have created an enormous societal impact. We must find solutions to address sustainable production and recycling, closing the loop. The proposed ERC will focus on renewal of rubber technology, revolutionizing a field that has been based on science and engineering from the last millennium. Bio-based AND fully recyclable polymers are sorely needed since humankind is being overtaken by plastic and rubber waste. This Planning Grant proposal will enable us to put together the best program and team possible, helping mankind to save our Earth. In spite of almost a 4,000 year history and the tools of modern biology, we still do not fully understand how natural rubber is made by plants. The United States has no commercial bio-based rubber production of its own and in 2018 imported over $1.5 billion worth of this raw material, critical to an economy that requires $13 billion worth of natural rubber for natural rubber containing tires, as well as many other natural rubber products. As demand for natural rubber continues to increase, we now face a significant supply problem. The proposed ERC will generate the knowledge needed to find the holy grail and understand how different plant species produce natural rubber, provide the methods essential to producing synthetic rubber using monomers from renewable resources that matches the properties of Hevea rubber, and cultivate and scale domestic rubber crops to industrial-level production. Inclusion and diversity in this ERC are addressed, for example: the initial leadership team has 3 women and 2 men, and a specific subset of young people on the autistic and dyslexic spectrum will be engaged. Providing opportunities to high functioning students from these groups will leverage their absolute strength in abstract spatial reasoning in discussion, interpretation and prediction, to benefit and SuRPrISE the more conventional ""normal"" thinkers.

The proposed ERC will address strategically focused fundamental research in natural rubbers, with special emphasis on domestic crops that biosynthesize macromolecules that match natural rubber from rubber trees (Hevea), viz., high molecular weight cis-1,4 polyisoprene. We aim at seamless blending of science and engineering that leads to sustainable and ecologically-sound scalability, built with industrial collaborations that will translate new discoveries into commercially viable applications within a resilient bio-economy. More specifically, the Center will address strategic fundamental research in elastomers and crosslinked rubbers to achieve absolute gains in sustainability, while meeting or exceeding current levels of performance required by both legacy and new applications.  New ways of approaching material needs and gaps will be developed and validated, creating a robust, broadly applicable demonstration of commercial resiliency informed by sustainable and resilient natural systems, accepted by our industrial collaborators and their customers.  To achieve this, the Center intends to: 1) understand natural rubber biosynthesis, including NR structure, and the structure of enzymes involved in NR biosynthesis; 2) overcome limitations to expansion of alternative NR crops in the US; 3) discover synthetic polymer analogs of NR by combining true biomimicry with chemical, biochemical and biologically-sustainable production systems; 4) synthesize new recyclable crosslinked rubbers and composite materials with novel combinations of mechanical properties from renewable resources, especially focusing on un-met performance and structural needs; 5) qualify all discoveries through analysis and prediction of their commercial viability and sustainability as industrial adoption and production moves from niche markets to commodity scale. These goals can only be achieved by a well-organized ERC, the goal of this planning grant addressing societal impact, convergence, stakeholder community, and team formation having effective leadership/management. The proposed vision requires interdisciplinary collaboration among academe, industry and government organizations. Based on these collaborations a new discipline of ""Scalable Scigineering"" can be established, which will integrate science and engineering at a fundamental and scalable level.

"Biologists are deluged with sequence data yet have derived comparatively little biological information from it. The accurate annotation of protein function is key to understanding life, but experimentally determining what each protein does is costly and difficult, and cannot scale up to accommodate the vast amount of sequence data already available. Therefore discovering protein protein function by computational, rather than experimental means, is of primary importance. Genomic sequence data are available from thousands of species,  and those are coupled with massive high-throughput experimental data. Together, these data have created new opportunities as well as challenges for computational function prediction. As a result, many computational annotation methods have been developed by research groups worldwide, but their accuracy and applicability need to be improved upon. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG) is to bring together computational biologists, experimental biologists and biocurators who are dealing with the important problem of predicting protein function, to share ideas, and create collaborations. To improve computational function prediction methods, the Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation algorithms (CAFA) was established as an ongoing experiment. CAFA was designed to provide a large-scale assessment of computational methods dedicated to predicting protein function. By challenging dozens of research groups worldwide to develop and provide their best software for function prediction, the researchers involved in the AFP-SIG will improve the ability of biologists to understand life at the molecular level. The AFP-SIG researchers will also generate experimental data from fruit-flies, fungi and bacteria to be used as benchmarks to test the software participating in CAFA, and a deeper understanding of these model organisms. 

It is now possible to collect data that comprehensively profile many different states of complex biological systems. Using these data it should be possible to understand and explain the underlying systems, but significant challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is that, as researchers collect more data from many different organisms in many different systems, they discover more and different genes. Assigning functions to these newly discovered genes represents a key step towards interpretation of high-throughput data. This leads to a critical need to assess the quality of the function prediction methods that researchers have developed in recent years. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG), founded in 2005, is to bring together bioinformaticians and biologists who are addressing this key challenge of gene function prediction. In addition to sharing ideas and creating collaboration, AFP-SIG has created CAFA: the Critical Assessment of (protein) Function Annotation. CAFA is a community-driven challenge to assess the performance of protein function prediction software, and it has been carried out twice since 2010.  The investigators will provide the following outcomes: (1) robust open-source software to be used in function prediction and assessment of function prediction methods, incorporated into the high-profile annotation pipelines of UniProt-GOA; (2) expansion of the AFP community by engaging bioinformaticians, biocurators and experimentalists, thereby improving the quality and relevance of function prediction methods; (3) large-scale experimental screens in Drosophila, Candida and Pseudomonas for novel associations of targeted functional terms with genes; (4) an expanded CAFA event, incorporating both the curated annotations from the literature and our own experimental screens, in the last two years of the project.

"Developing new routes to transform readily available and renewable resources into useful materials is one of the grand challenges of the 21st century chemistry. The design of catalysts that mimic the enzymes used by nature is a promising way to transform readily available starting materials such as plant cellulose. In this project, Professor Susanne Striegler of the University of Arkansas is developing fundamental understanding of enzyme-like catalysts and exploiting the synergy between their structure and function. This basic research is beneficial to our society as new avenues toward fine chemicals from bio-renewable resources grow in importance. Dr. Striegler is actively engaged in outreach activities to encourage middle and high school students in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines and in combination with German language skill development. Encouraging students to strengthen their German language skills and STEM education prepares them to engage others at an international level and to study and work abroad.


With funding from the Chemical Catalysis and Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Programs of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Striegler of the University of Arkansas is developing biomimetic macromolecular, nanogel catalysts and elaborating the synergy between catalysis-supporting matrix effects and the catalytic function of transition metal complexes. The resulting catalysts may find applications ranging from new antimicrobial agents to biofuel production from non-activated oligosaccharides. Structure-activity relationship studies are being used to elaborate transition state-stabilizing interactions between non-activated saccharides and binuclear copper(II) complexes. The studies utilize kinetic analyses in combination with a computational approach to reveal binding sites of the saccharides, and energies and geometries of sugar-metal complex assemblies. The fundamental and basic studies are projected to maximize the catalytic potency of nanogels and open new research frontiers in biomimetic catalysis. Dr. Striegler is actively engaged in outreach programs focusing on student recruitment into the STEM fields by connecting German speaking local middle and high-school students and their teachers to the training and career opportunities in the STEM field.

"Fishes are masters of locomotion in fluids owing to their highly integrated biological sensing, computing and motor systems. They are adept at collecting and exploiting rich information from the surrounding fluids for underwater sensing and locomotion control. Inspired and informed by fish swimming, this research aims to develop a novel bio-inspired cyber-physical system (CPS) that integrates the ?physical? robot fish and fluid environment with the ?cyber? robot control & machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this CPS system includes i) a pressure sensory skin with distributed sensing capability to collect flow information, ii) control and learning algorithms that compute robot motor signals, output by central pattern generators (CPGs) which receive pressure sensory feedback, iii) a robot fish platform to implement and validate the CPS framework for underwater sensing and control tasks, and iv) experimental and computational methods to investigate and model the underlying fluid physics. This CPS system will have immediate impacts on the core CPS research areas such as design, control, data analytics, autonomy, and real-time systems. It will also significantly impact a wide range of engineering applications which demand distributed sensing, control and adaptive actuation. Examples include human-machine interactions, medical robots, unmanned aerial/underwater vehicles, drug dosing, medical therapeutics, and space deployable structures among others. Leveraging the multidisciplinary nature of this research, this award will support a variety of educational and outreach activities. In particular, a list of activities in broadening participation in engineering will be carried out.

      This research project integrates multiple CPS technologies to develop bio-inspired technologies for swarm control of fish. These include inthanovations in a pressure sensitive skin  project will first develop a distributed pressure sensitive synthetic skin, which will be installed on robotic fishes to map the pressure distribution on their body and caudal-fin surfaces. The distributed pressure information will then be used in a feedback control policy that modulates CPGs to produce caudal-fin motion patterns of the robotic fishes. The control policy and the caudal-fin motion patterns will be optimized via reinforcement learning first in a surrogate fluid environment and then in the true fluid environment. The surrogate fluid environment will be developed using data-driven non-parametric models informed by physics-based hydrodynamic models of fish swimming, trained using combined experimental and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation data. The above control-learning methods will also be used to achieve efficient schooling in a group of robotic fishes, individually controlled by a CPG, which interacts with each other through surrounding fluids and pressure sensory feedback. The optimized swimming/schooling performance of robotic fishes and the underlying physics will be studied using CFD simulation. Together, this research will advance CPS knowledge on: 1) the design and creation of electronic and sensor materials and devices for robot skin applications; 2) the development of data-efficient, physics-informed learning methods for robotic systems that operate in complex environments, especially leveraging the recent progress on deep learning to exploit the spatial and temporal richness of the pressure data for underwater sensing and robot control; and 3) the flow physics and modeling of fish swimming.

"Non-technical Abstract
Hypoxia is an abnormal decrease of oxygen levels in tissues.  Although different tissues and cells have distinct thresholds and susceptibility to hypoxia, at a cellular level, hypoxia and hypoxic responses generally occur at approximately 1-3 % oxygen.  Compelling evidence has shown that reduced tissue oxygenation is present in various diseases, and more particularly cancer.  A large number of human solid tumors profoundly lack oxygen, exhibiting hypoxic tumor areas; this condition is mainly due to an imbalance between delivery of oxygen via the blood circulation and consumption by cancer cells.  Hypoxia can arise via a number of mechanisms.  For instance, fast growing hypoxic tumors typically have poor vessel bio-distribution, increased vascular defects, and low vessel number.  Furthermore, highly proliferating cancer cells that outgrow the neovascularization also participate in tumor hypoxia.  An increasing list of cancers with hypoxic regions has been reported over the last decade and include endometrial carcinoma, ovarian, melanoma, lymphoma, breast, bladder, brain, head and neck, renal, colon, gastric, pancreatic, prostate, and non-small cell lung cancers.  The research objective of this proposal is to apply standard methods of biomaterials science and engineering to emulate a hypoxic tumor microenvironment and better understand the interplay between tumor and dendritic cells, the major directors of immune responses.  The proposed studies are likely to offer new modalities in cancer immunotherapy and are expected to justify the use of hypoxia-suppressive biomaterials, reinforce tumoricidal functions of immune cells, and ultimately increase tumor rejections.  The educational goal of this proposal is to introduce biomaterials science and engineering to high school students (develop hands-on science curriculum, promote practical research experience, and foster STEM field trips to the campus), enhance undergraduate research exposure and experience to underrepresented students (Hispanic, African-American, and female), and expand the Northeastern University co-op model to include graduate and academic lab experiences.  

Technical Abstract
Hypoxic cancers are usually aggressive, resistant to standard therapies, and thus very difficult to eradicate. A better understanding of how these hypoxic cancer cells interact with the immune system would allow tailoring of efficient therapies and better outcomes. Hypoxia can inhibit differentiation, antigen capture, maturation, lymph node homing of dendritic cells (DCs), the main regulators of immune responses, which can impair downstream T cell development, differentiation and cytotoxic activity.  Immunosuppression represents one of the fundamental tumor immune evasion mechanisms.  Therefore, it is important to expand our understanding on how hypoxia affects DCs and find ways to circumvent hypoxia-driven immunosuppression locally and restore immune cell function and activity.  To address this need, the primary research objective of this proposal is to engineer biomaterials to modulate the local hypoxic environment to understand immune cell function and activity.  To achieve this goal, this proposal has three aims: 1) Design injectable oxygen-generating cryogel scaffolds to controllably deliver oxygen, 2) Engineer a B16-F10 melanoma tumor microenvironment in three-dimension and deliver oxygen locally to modulate inherent and tumor-induced hypoxia, and 3) Disrupt hypoxia and modulate oxygen tension to understand how local oxygenation can regulate dendritic cell survival and function and impact their activity in an in-vitro ovalbumin (B16-F10/OVA) melanoma model.  The long-term educational goal of the proposal is to promote and train the next generation of scientists to work in academia, industry and clinical settings developing innovative biomaterials to improve human quality of life. The major aims of this program are: 1) Introduce K-12 students to Biomaterials Science (develop a hands-on science curriculum, implement practical research experience, and foster STEM field trips to campus), 2) Enhance undergraduate research exposure and experience to underrepresented students (Hispanic, African-American, and female), and 3) Expand the Northeastern University co-op model to include graduate and academic lab experiences.

"Non-technical description:

Photonic integrated circuits (ICs) have enabled many applications such as optical communication, bio-sensing, and quantum communication. To utilize the full functionality of photonic ICs, integrated electronic-photonic circuits are demanded, an essential component of which is an economical, silicon-compatible, and electronically addressable laser in the photonic IC. In the visible wavelengths, although epitaxially grown III-N semiconductors are the main gain medium candidate for on-chip lasers, they lack silicon-compatibility and is expensive. This proposal explores solution-processed metal-halide perovskites as alternative gain media and develops perovskite laser diodes on the silicon platform. By judiciously engineering the gain medium composition and band alignment of carrier transport layers with perovskite gain, employing defect-passivation, and designing for low-threshold laser cavities, environmentally stable perovskite laser diodes can be realized. The family of perovskite lasers developed in this program will enable efficient and low-cost integrated photonic solutions for confocal microscopy, on-chip fluorescent sensing, and flow cytometry in the bio-photonics area, as well as visible light communication and on-chip quantum emitters in the optical communication area. It will also help closing the “green gap” where conventional epitaxially grown inorganic semiconductors suffer from low efficiencies, and advance the field of solution-processed semiconductor lasers. The educational portion of the program aims to increase public awareness of photonics and to pipeline qualified students to help advance the U.S. photonics industry.

Technical description:

A crucial yet unavailable component in high-performance visible-wavelength photonic ICs and other chip-scale photonic systems is a silicon-compatible on-chip laser that is efficient, stable, economical, and electronically addressable. So far, III-N lasers are the main candidates, but their material platform requires complex epitaxial growth and lattice constant matching to the silicon substrate. Although solution-processed metal-halide perovskites have been suggested as alternative gain media, and many perovskite lasers have been demonstrated so far, all perovskite lasers to date are optically pumped. Additionally, they operate under ultrafast pulsed pumping and/or at cryogenic temperatures and have a short lifetime. This program starts by developing economical, environmentally stable and silicon-compatible perovskite lasers that operate under continuous wave optical pumping at room temperature. This can be achieved by directly patterning perovskite into high-Q laser resonators with the manufacturing friendly nanoimprint lithography, then defect-passivating the perovskite with polycarbonate. This program further aims to demonstrate electrically pumped perovskite lasers through band alignment tailoring of carrier transport layers for efficient current injection, perovskite-polymer blending for minimal leakage current, low-loss electrode formation to reduce wasteful non-radiative recombination at electrodes, and low-threshold laser cavity design. This work will not only lead to the insertion of perovskite lasers into functional photonic ICs, but also the long-sought-after realization of solution-processed laser diodes. On a more system level, this work will enable the connectivity between the photonic “plane” and electronic “plane” in multi-functional adaptive photonic/electronic integrated systems.

"Remarkable adhesive mechanisms have evolved across the animal kingdom to help jumping spiders stick a landing, octopi catch prey, geckos locomote on vertical surfaces, and clingfish grip slippery, bio-fouled rocks. In each of these distinct and well-studied cases, there were strong connections between adhesion and survival to drive the evolutionary process. This research team has recently discovered that cartilage, a material well-known for exceptionally low adhesive friction, generates exceptionally strong adhesive stresses -- comparable to those of the gecko, octopus, and clingfish. This finding is paradoxical, because friction and adhesion are fundamentally linked. Additionally, unlike other natural examples of strong adhesion, there is no obvious evolutionary pressure for strong joint adhesion. The fact that cartilage simultaneously exhibits both ""super-lubricity"" and ""super-adhesion"" violates long-standing assumptions about cartilage lubrication while exposing critical clues about the unusual underlying mechanics. This EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project seeks to resolve this ""cartilage lubrication-adhesion"" paradox.  The results will: (1) clarify how tensile forces are generated in the joint and what that implies about joint lubrication; (2) provide original insights into bio-adhesion while exposing new directions for bio-inspiration and materials discovery; (3) lend insight into the causes and consequences of ""joint cracking"", a common, clinically important, and poorly understood phenomenon.  If the understanding of cartilage functional mechanics are condensed into a single framework, it will inform substantially improved strategies to protect, treat, or replace compromised joints.

The project will use novel interfacial tension measurements to quantify interfacial permeability, experimentally separate the contributions from adhesion (seen in the gecko) and suction (seen in the clingfish) mechanisms, and systematically assess the intersection between cartilage friction and adhesion across length scales.  Using micro force microscopy, beam displacements from normal and friction forces will be quantified on an experimental indenter.  Cartilage samples (osteochondral cores) will be obtained from bovine joints.  Three aims have been developed.  The first will isolate the effect of exudation on adhesion, suction, and interfacial gaps by varying the dwell time prior to pull-off to systematically vary interstitial fluid loss.  The second aim will isolate and quantify adhesive forces by eliminating the contribution of suction, using quasistatic rates for the pull-off tests.  The third aim will quantify the interfacial properties (e.g. sliding friction, effective contact modulus, equilibrium modulus, and fluid load fraction) across length scales by using varying probe radii, which will have varying effects on suction forces (dependent on radius) and adhesion forces (independent of radius).

"Soil microbes compete. As a result they evolved tools to resist their enemies. However, there is also evidence of collaboration between microbes (endosymbiosis), where bacteria live inside fungal cells. We have shown that, together, a bacterial endosymbiont and its fungal host create a holobiont that can make a powerful toxin that blocks soil-dwelling amoebae from engulfing the fungus. This endosymbiotic bacterium also changes how the fungus controls its own gene expression to fight different kinds of stress. This project examines how frequently fungi and endosymbionts evade amoebae; the implications for fungal housing of endosymbionts; and whether these symbioses lead to co-evolution. To answer these questions, we will look at bacterial-fungal partnerships across a wide range of species, looking for differences and commonalities in their shared genomes. We will also record reactions of wild-type and mutant fungal-bacterial endosymbionts with amoebae in the lab to identify the different strategies they can take to evade amoebae engulfment. Finally, we will examine one endosymbiont pair in depth to understand the mechanisms that allow these partnerships to exist. Amoebae are very similar to the cells in the human immune system that are the first line of defense against infection. Thus, this study can help our understanding of immunity. Additional broader impacts of this proposal include developing fungal biological education modules and teaching resources in the K-6 classrooms, develop mushroom grow kits for children, and participation in science podcasts. 
 
Identifying how environmental fungi developed traits to evade immune cells is critical to understanding the causes of opportunistic fungal infections in nature and in humans. Mucoromycota are primarily soil-associated fungi, some of which are also opportunistic mammalian pathogens. We recently identified an endosymbiosis between Betaproteobacteria Ralstonia (bacterium) and Mucoromycota Rhizopus (fungus), a symbiosis that blocks engulfment and killing of the fungus by the soil-dwelling amoeba Dictyostelium and also confers virulence in animals. Endosymbioses between Betaproteobacteria and Mucoromycota are environmentally ubiquitous. Endosymbionts are also observed in approximately half of clinical Rhizopus isolates, where phagocyte-related deficiencies are a major predictor of susceptibility. We hypothesize that interactions between bacterium-fungus holobionts and soil amoeba drive their evolutionary trajectories and opportunistic virulence in mammals. We will use phenotypic, genomic, and molecular tools to dissect the holobiont-phagocyte interaction and investigate host-pathogen interactions at two levels: 1) interactions between bacteria and their fungal hosts, and 2) the effect of endosymbionts on phagocyte evasion and opportunistic virulence. We will take both an unbiased approach to survey bacterial-fungal-amoebal interactions across the genus and a directed approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms for specific bacterial-fungal isolates alone and with amoeba. These mechanistic studies will be coupled to comparative genomics analyses to reveal how evolutionary pressures exerted by amoebae drive endosymbiosis and immune evasion.  This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.

"Some surgical procedures are challenging to perform because they demand speed and precision of instrument control that tax the limits of even the most skilled surgeons.  This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project is based on the premise that intelligent surgical robotics can elevate skilled performance of precision manual tasks by melding the high-level planning and adaptability of the human surgeon with the superhuman speed and precision of a hand-held robotic tool. The specific application to be studied and modeled is 3D printing of biologically-compatible materials directly onto moving human anatomy using hand-held, robotic, bio-jet technology.  This is an example of a new convergent discipline, which the PI calls ""computational co-surgery."" Here, the handheld robot shares control of the bio-jet with the surgeon. Realizing the full potential of the human / robot dyad will require seamless cooperation and a dynamic tradeoff between speed and accuracy to deal with unpredictable target motions. This in turn requires the human surgeon to monitor and evaluate the quality and intent of the robot's motions as they unfold at high speed. The project will quantify the ability of humans to perceive and characterize visual feedback of tool motion at high speeds using a novel crowd-sourcing approach. Seamless cooperation also requires that the surgeon exert high-bandwidth control over the hand-held device. The proposal will explore the extent to which voluntary modulation of limb reflex responses can facilitate low-latency monitoring and control operations. The project also includes several annual outreach events where participants use handheld robots to discover and learn about computational co-surgery and human-robot shared control.  As such, this CAREER project promotes the progress of science, advances the national health, and contributes to the development of the STEM workforce, with efforts to attract students from underrepresented minority populations. 

The PI will advance a new interdisciplinary field of study termed ""computational co-surgery"" through a project that will ultimately enable 3D printing of bio-materials directly onto moving human anatomy using hand-held, robotic technology.  The project combines elements of psychology (visual perception), engineering (robotic design and control), and physiology (sensorimotor control) to promote the ability of the human surgeon to leverage the speed and precision of a hand-held robotic tool. In the case to be studied, an intelligent robot and a human surgeon share control of a surgical instrument, with touch and proprioception as the feedback channels and limb stiffness modulation as the actuation method. The research objective is to measure how humans perceive (Aim 1) and interact with (Aim 2) objects that move with high speed (<1kHz bandwidth) and precision (~50 um).  Aim 1 will use Amazon Mechanical Turk to test the working hypothesis that when viewing tool manipulations, assessments of skill reflect a trade-off between movement speed and movement quality (precision) subject to psychological factors including internal models of limb and object dynamics, and stimulus coherence in multisensory integration.  Further, the project will explore the utility of touch and proprioception (feedback) and limb stiffness modulation (actuation) to realize low-latency, non-invasive bidirectional human-robot monitoring and control. Aim 2 will use a customized hand-held robot with high- and low-inertia modes and a Fitts pointing task to test the working hypotheses that: 1) limb stiffness modulation is a fast and effective means of quickly ceding control between robot and human intent during manipulations requiring high speed and precision; and 2) humans naturally modulate effective stiffness at the hand-robot interface via long-latency reflex action (i.e., without lengthy training).  Accomplishing these Aims will advance the fundamental science of handheld collaborative robots that cope with unpredictable human motion or human intent. The educational goal includes an outreach plan where participants are invited to use a small hand-held robot to see if they can ""perform better than the best surgeon"" in mock surgical tasks.  Sites span classroom settings, public events, and international acconferences attended by clinicians and engineers.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation-Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project will be to transform plastics manufacturing by using lignin, a naturally occurring material, as a renewable feedstock.  Plastics are a major component of many consumer products such as bottles, synthetic fibers, building materials, etc., and are currently made from petroleum resources. In recent years, many attempts have been made to produce ingredients for plastics from agricultural resources as a more sustainable feedstock. One technological challenge is the ability to handle the diversity of plant sources (grasses vs. hardwoods) as feedstocks to make consistent and compatible ingredients currently used in plastics. This work develops a technology to make plastic precursors from lignin derived from various sources, such as cellulosic ethanol plants or the pulp and paper industry. The proposed technology breaks down the lignin into smaller chemicals that are readily transformed into substances that can be used to make plastics. By demonstrating a modular technology concept, scale-up to industrial production rates is achieved by simply increasing the number of modules.  The commercialization of this technology has the ability to capture a significant fraction of the related global phenolic resins market, expected to reach nearly $16 billion by 2025.  Such value-added products will significantly enhance the economic viability of biorefineries.   
  
The proposed project will address the major challenge of developing practically viable technologies to make value added products from lignin for profitable biorefineries. Specific objectives are to demonstrate a scalable technology for converting lignin from various sources (alkaline, organosolv and milled lignin) to bio-based prepolymers suitable for making resins and plastics.   This is achieved by selective ozonolysis of the lignin solution (in acetic acid) in a spray reactor to partially break up the lignin into low molecular weight aromatics which are then grafted on to the macromolecular lignin structure by acidification with sulfuric acid in a stirred reactor.  This technology converts >95% of the lignin to prepolymers which are separated by filtration from the solvent which is recycled.  These two steps occur sequentially at mild operating conditions (ambient temperature and pressure) that favor process economics.  Process optimization to form prepolymers with desired properties will be guided by benchmarking with conventional phenol-formaldehyde and bakelite-type resins.  Process scalability will be demonstrated by operating multiple spray reactors in parallel followed by acidification of the combined ozonolysis product to generate prepolymers with identical properties and in sufficient quantities for product testing.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery platform that will identify novel types of antibody therapeutics.  The goal is to use antibodies to increase or decrease the activity of a type of cell signaling receptor called ""G protein-coupled receptors"" (GPCRs). There are more than 400 non-olfactory human GPCRs that are involved in all aspects of health and disease, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, pain, inflammation, and others. About 25% of GPCRs have been targeted by approved small molecule drugs, but efforts for the remaining have often failed because of the inability of small molecules to distinguish between similar GPCRs. Antibody drugs can overcome this hurdle because of their much higher specificity for their targets. This project will bring to commercialization the first technology that directly identifies antibodies that modulate GPCR function. These antibodies will impact healthcare by enabling therapies for diseases with poor or no current treatments. They also will impact scientific understanding by enabling the study of GPCR-related physiology and disease. The commercial impacts are potentially very large. The GPCR drug market is over $100B, and most antibody therapeutics have annual sales over $1B. The platform described here could enable dozens of novel GPCR antibody therapeutics, creating value for patients, society, and co-development partners.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery technology for discovering antibodies that modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Current methods are limited because GPCR antigens are often not properly folded, and because antibodies are selected by how tightly they bind GPCRs, rather than by the effect they exert. Those that bind typically do not have any effect at all. This project will build on the successful proof-of-concept from Phase I that demonstrated the platform's ability to identify directly functional antibody agonists for a human GPCR. The proposal addresses the four main technical requirements that pharmaceutical customers cite as important: Ability to work on many types of GPCRs, ability to isolate antibodies with varied modulating effects, use of a highly diverse, high-quality scFv library, and a workflow that can quickly isolate, optimize and characterize dozens of candidates. The goals of this project are to improve how the platform's yeasts express GPCRs and functionally couple them to different selectable readouts, construct a proprietary scFv library, and optimize the workflow by incorporating sequencing bioinformatics and antibody characterization, including flow cytometric analysis of cell-binding and functional assays on cultured mammalian cells.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology that will enable robust, contamination-free, continuous biomanufacturing.  While biomanufacturing may be one of the most technologically complex and profitable industries, the underlying production process, batch fermentation, has not changed in decades. In theory, continuous fermentation would decrease operational cost and increase production capacity.  However, owing to the high risk of contamination, continuous fermentation is considered unreliable and is rarely used. The proposed technology solves this issue and enables contamination-free, continuous fermentation. Successful implementation of continuous fermentation facilitates automated production and paves the way for future technological development in continuous product purification and recovery. The reduced operational cost is essential for the economic viability of bio-based commodity chemicals such as bioplastics, as their market demand depends primarily on their price competitiveness with petroleum-derived counterparts. The proposed technology also eliminates the use of antibiotics in fermentation, which in turn alleviates antibiotic misuse and promotes a positive environmental and health impact. 

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to explore the feasibility of using a biocide/biocide-resistant system to prevent and treat microbial contamination during continuous biomanufacturing. Microbial contamination in biomanufacturing processes is a major concern, as it results in loss of productivity, time, and money.  In addition, it restricts the production mode to slow batch fermentation, and prohibits the implementation of continuous fermentation. The proposed technology solves the contamination problem, as a biocide will inhibit the invading microbial and viral contaminants and a biocide-resistant enzyme will protect the processing hosts. The proposed Phase I research will address the technical challenges by using classical molecular biology and synthetic biology techniques. The first objective is to demonstrate that the proposed technology will provide biocide resistance to bioplastics-producing organisms while inhibiting the outgrowth of contaminants. The second objective is to show that the proposed technology can be used to prevent and treat contamination in continuous fermenters. The final objective is to fine-tune the biocide/biocide-resistant system to demonstrate the technology will not adversely affect the production yield and product quality in continuous fermenters. If successful, future Phase II development will be conducted in pilot and industrial-scale reactors to further optimize the technology.

"The history of technology is crucial to understanding what makes us human. Microscopic wear traces present on the earliest (stone) tools excavated by archaeologists, offer key insights into how ancient people worked a variety of materials, like wood, skins, ivory, etc. Despite the enormous interpretive potential, archaeologists have experienced problems related to the difficulty and efficiency of securely identifying worked materials from wear traces, as well as reproducing each other’s results. This project will harness the power of tribology and artificial intelligence (AI) to advance understanding how wear patterns form and, at the same time, facilitate and democratize the identification process. Beside scientific publications, the investigators will produce an open-source tool for helping other researchers use their algorithms in their own work. The produced results will thus be useful to both the bio-engineering community as well as to archaeologists. To address pipeline issues in archaeological science, the project will increase diversity and the representation of minority groups by engaging high school students from New York City in the lab experiments.

The project seeks to solve a 70-year standing problem in archaeology: how does wear form on the surface of stone tools as a result of working different materials? Answering this question will generate predictions that will enable large-scale studies of archaeological wear to be carried out in the future. To tackle this problem, an interdisciplinary team of archaeologists, together with mechanical and bio-materials engineers will first catalogue the mechanical properties of natural worked materials, such as wood, ivory, skins, etc. The researchers will then build surrogate biomaterials isolating the role of these properties (such as hardness, elasticity, fracture toughness, etc.), so that their effect on wear formation can be tested individually in experiments. Each surrogate material will be rubbed against experimentally produced stone bits using a tribometer. The result will be a large collection of recorded wear patterns that can be causally correlated with worked material properties. In a second experiment, stone bits will be used in more realistic tasks using a force-controlled robot and organic target materials to generate a large collection of wear patterns that approximate archaeological wear. Information from both experiments will be used to train computers to classify archaeologically occurring wear patterns according to the materials they most likely came into contact with. Moreover, classification algorithms with and without expert input for identifying worked materials will be compared, which addresses the application of artificial intelligence in archaeology, a topic which is currently of great interest to archaeologists in general.

"This award develops a novel biological cell-like system for accessing and processing information in molecular data systems. Specifically, the investigators will build new technologies that enable customized gene expression in an electronic system and perform information processing in molecular form. The goals of the project explore new methods of hybrid electronic-molecular engineering that leverage progress in molecular mechanisms, DNA sequencing technology, and electronics. In developing a novel approach to electrically-actuated gene expression, the project presents a path towards building integrated hybrid systems that draw on the strengths of electronics (size, precision, control) and molecular components (density, parallelism, efficiency), enabling new computing applications. Beyond computing, the project has the potential to enable new methods of characterizing and controlling synthetic genetic systems with impact in the life sciences, bioengineering, and human health.

Technical objectives include 1) an electronically programmable cell-free gene expression system (“eChromatin”) that will automate dynamic sourcing of biological reagents needed to operate biochemical processes within molecular information systems; and 2) new methods of processing information stored in molecular form, such as DNA data random access and content-based similarity search using a new CRISPR-Cas9 addressing scheme and nanopore sequencing for fast and highly multiplexed access of molecular data.  The eChromatin system design consists of a switchable electrode array in a flow cell patterned with unique DNA components that can be electronically exposed or sequestered, enabling dynamic gene expression analogous to the remodeling of natural chromatin-DNA complexes. The Cas9-based data access strategy is designed to have significant advantages over previous work in DNA data storage, including 1) decreased time-to-decoding by eliminating PCR prep and cycle time, 2) increased multiplexability, 3) increased storage densities, and 4) increased energy efficiencies due to replacing PCR heating and cooling steps with isothermal reactions. The investigators will then integrate these approaches in a demonstration of automated end-to-end protocols within large-scale DNA data pools.

"This award is funded in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). This project investigates Body Modification Technologies: wearable devices for biosensing through novel form factors with embedded biosensors that interact with body fluids. Current practices for body modification include piercing, tattooing, branding, binding, bodybuilding, and inserting implants. By establishing new collaborations with surgeons, cosmetics companies, beauty salons, and dermatologists, this project investigates placing biosensors on and underneath the skin through body modification materials--lipstick, hair dye, piercings, and tattoos. Biosensors in direct contact with body fluids can significantly improve biological sensing data. This project develops new knowledge about methods and effects of transforming the body into a bio-display, in order to make visible information from metabolism that is usually imperceptible. Potential applications include monitoring illnesses, hormonal changes, dental health, eating disorders, stress tracking, pharmacokinetics, maintaining a culture of health in communities, and sensing changes in environmental factors such as pollution, temperature and UV. Further, the project will collaborate with experts on privacy, safety, and biocompatibility to articulate ethical principles for creating Body Modification Technologies.

The Body Modification Technologies project advances wearable computing by developing implementation and evaluation methods to reveal metabolic information by using the form factors of body modifications as a substrate for chromogenic, fluorescence and electrochemical biosensors. This project investigates the design of the electronics, functional algorithms, biotechnology applications, and form factors, e.g., the shape, size, materials, and other physical characteristics that make it possible to wear such devices. Expected outcomes include: (1) fabrication processes for creating the form factors that embed biosensors into body modification materials; (2) design and implementation of hardware and software for devices and mobile applications; (3) dissemination of benchmarking datasets and methods for evaluation of Body Modification Technologies; and (4) derivation of a set of principles and implications on privacy, safety, bio-compatibility, and inclusive design.

"This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award will support integrated research and educational efforts to generate new knowledge of how material and thickness non-uniformity (also referred to as heterogeneity) in thin, bio-compatible materials and bio-tissues affect their mechanical behaviors under various deformation conditions.  Examples of such materials include ultra-thin wearable bio-sensors, the eardrum membrane, and the heart valves.  The award supports fundamental research that will enable a currently unavailable, non-destructive material characterization protocol for obtaining the material property maps, which will allow the deformation and stability of these materials to be better understood. The innovative approach in this project is expected to promote scientific advancement in new mechanics knowledge that is important for a wide range of healthcare and biomedical applications, thereby impacting the national health and economy.  The project will provide opportunities to train graduate and undergraduate students in the important interdisciplinary areas of mechanics, materials science, and biomedical devices.  The educational outreach activities are designed to engage young children and under-represented minorities in STEM education, with the goal of enlarging the STEM talent pool for the nation.

Many important natural and synthesized heterogeneous thin membranes wrinkle under very small loads. Stability of thin structures has long been a canonical problem in the mechanics community. Yet to date, huge discrepancies in buckling loads between theories and experiments are still usually accounted for by empirical corrections. There is a clear lag in understanding for predicting the buckling loads of thin heterogeneous membranes. The objective of this CAREER project is to test the hypothesis that a higher degree of heterogeneity in thin membranes reduces the critical buckling loads. The research approach is to experimentally measure and compare the buckling loads of a set of thin membranes of various degrees of heterogeneity ranging from highly heterogeneous to homogeneous. Fluorescence stereo microscopy and inverse finite element analysis will be combined to extract the material property distributions and thickness variability, and then a theory-guided numerical model will be developed to identify a quantitative degree of heterogeneity and elucidate how it is related to reduced buckling loads.

This project is jointly funded by the Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation program (CMMI), and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"This project was awarded through the ""National Science Foundation (NSF) / National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Joint Research on Environmental Sustainability Challenges"" opportunity. As the world's population expands to an expected 9 billion by 2050, there will be an urgent demand to balance interconnected resources such as agricultural products, fresh water, and fuel without putting undue strain on the ecosystems that provide these resources.  Treating Food-Energy-Water (FEW) Nexus as interconnected rather than as three independent systems drives new technological advancements that could increase the environmental sustainability and improve the economies of communities that adopt these new advances. This project will focus on rice, a basic staple food source that feeds over a third of the Earth's population. Rice production is staggeringly water-intensive, representing the highest use of fresh water resources. Irrigation water discharged from rice paddies carries excessive amounts of nutrients, pesticides, and other contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), which pollute rivers, streams and reused irrigation water. To tackle water stress, reduce water pollution, and improve rice quality, researchers from the New Jersey Institute of Technology, in collaboration with researchers at Zhejiang University in China, will develop a biologically active filtration (BAF) system which takes advantage of microbes that consume unwanted organic matter contaminants. The BAF can be easily deployed to the existing water discharge channels at rice paddies to treat irrigated water. It will be developed and tested at select rice production sites to optimize its efficiency and cost-effectiveness in purifying the irrigation water, given the field conditions and social and economic constraints. This novel technology has the potential to transform conventional rice production into a sustainable agricultural practice by turning agricultural wastes into bio-oil and biochar, thereby synergizing the use of biochar and microorganisms to treat agricultural pollution. The BAF process and products will be coupled with recycling treated water for irrigation, and the bio-oil can be used as a renewable energy alternative. In collaboration with local governments, regulatory agencies, farmers, and universities, both the U.S. and Chinese research teams will conduct vibrant outreach activities to transfer and disseminate this technology to broader rice farming communities.

Effective adsorbent media and a biofilm with versatile and robust catalytic potentials are essential components for BAF systems. This project will advance our understanding of these two components and optimize their performance to mitigate commingled nonpoint-source contaminants commonly found in the irrigation water for rice production. The surface chemistry of biochar and its interactions with target contaminant molecules will be investigated to improve the adsorption capacity and selectivity of this material. During biochar pyrolysis, yield of bio-oil will be optimized as a renewable energy alternative. Microorganisms attached to the biochar are key players for nutrient removal and CEC degradation. A comprehensive blueprint of actively expressing metabolisms in the biofilm will be revealed at both community and single cellular levels using the combination of omics and single cell analysis. Novel biotransformation pathways and associated enzymes/genes will be discovered to untangle underlying molecular mechanisms, enabling the design of molecular tools to monitor biofilm biotransformation performance in the BAF systems. Improvement of nutrient removal will be achieved by leveraging filter dimension and flow rate to synchronize nitrification and denitrification stratification in the attached biofilm. Development of models will facilitate the prediction and design of operational performance in accordance with contaminant removal mechanisms. Built upon comprehensive socioeconomic analyses of the life-cycle impacts, cost-effectiveness, and local acceptance, pilot-scale BAFs at select rice paddy sites will be established as model systems that are adaptable by China, the United States, and other rice-producing countries. The goal of these pilot studies is to achieve water contamination mitigation, food safety assurance, bioenergy production and carbon sequestration, and protection of human and environmental health. Through distant learning modules and cross-university training, this project will cultivate next-generation leaders with intercultural skillsets, perspectives, and proficiencies to unite multidisciplinary experiences and tackle the complex food-energy-water challenges using sustainable and innovative technologies.

"This proposal describes a unified study that will reveal the interactions of the motion of particles in a suspension flowing over a wall where slip-type boundary conditions exist. This research is transformative because it will be the first to comprehensively address the slow motion of particle-laden liquids over soft porous material and its related drag reduction. This project will substantially advance understanding of the behavior of slurry flows over highly compressible porous media in which the fiber can act as a lubricating layer, with the potential to vastly increase lift and reduce drag. The experimental methods and analysis techniques developed could also be applied to the motion of suspensions and non-Newtonian fluids over a broad array of structured/patterned surfaces such as hydrophobic surfaces. The insights gathered could significantly advance microfluidic-based devices in a wide range of industrial applications including, biomedical fields, chemical synthesis, (cell) biology, food, and pharmaceutics to drastically reduce friction and wear, leading to improved efficiencies and operating lifetimes for these devices. Teaching materials for this unified subject will be created by introducing suspension flows as an example of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics and their interaction with porous media to the engineering students. Undergraduates will participate as researchers in this project through the McNair summer research program, Clarkson's REU program in Sustainability, Clarkson's Honors program, or through a research elective. 

The goal of the proposed research is to provide the basis for understanding the flow of particle-laden liquids over soft porous materials, and use that understanding to explore a new bio-inspired concept for greatly enhancing the lubricating pressure while dramatically reducing friction and drag in a particle-laden slurry flowing over planar surfaces. This concept, inspired by the almost frictionless movement of red blood cells through capillaries, involves covering the planar surfaces with an array of soft porous material with a specific permeability and porosity. The objectives of the proposed project are to 1) develop an analytical model that accurately describes the slow motion of slurries over random arrays of soft porous media with specific mechanical properties by coupling the Brinkman equation with the diffusive flux model, and establishing scaling laws for coupled flows, and 2) experimentally validate that model by a specially designed experimental set-up using pressure drop as a means to measure drag reduction and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and particle-image velocimetry (PIV) to measurement fluid velocities.","Chicago","University of Illinois at Chicago","47.041","316943","FD-Fluid Dynamics","1854376","pmirbod@uic.edu","Parisa","Mirbod","02/06/2019","08/15/2018","01/31/2023","A bio-inspired strategy to dramatically reduce drag of particle-laden liquids over planar surfaces: characterization, theory and experiment","BIO"
"Title: Symposium on Computational Modeling and Image Processing of Biomedical Problems
Conference location: Michigan Technological University (MTU) 
Date: June 15-17,  2019
Website: http://pages.mtu.edu/~zhengfux/Overview.htm. 


From the discovery of penicillin (1928) to Human Genome Project (1990), breakthroughs in medicine have greatly impacted billions of people on earth. Among them, developments of medical imaging techniques such as x-ray imaging, computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a variety of other radiological imaging techniques have allowed the examination of the internal condition of the body without the use of invasive surgical procedures. Furthermore, medical imaging technologies are being increasingly used to provide guidance for surgery, biopsy, and radiation therapy in real-time. We are now on the cusp of another breakthrough era, given the availability of data, computational power, and novel computing methodology such as artificial intelligence, thereby potentially elevating human healthcare to a level never seen before. Mathematics, particularly, computational and applied mathematics, plays a foundational role in the projected advancement. 

The primary focus of the proposed interdisciplinary symposium is to provide an update on recent important contributions to computational and numerical methods in biomedical problems. Applying novel mathematics and modeling techniques to extract new or additional information from complex bio-medical datasets are particularly encouraged. Topics of interest include mathematical and computing methods and their immediate applications in the following areas: a) Novel mathematical image formation/reconstruction/processing methods and their applications in biomedical problems; b)Novel mathematical algorithms enabling multi-scale and multi-physics simulation related to biomedical problems;c) Scientific visualization and analytics of  (BIG) biomedical data; d) Novel machine learning and statistical analysis methods and their application in (BIG) biomedical data. One of the main challenges when integrating mathematics into biomedical sciences is overcoming existing barriers. Unfamiliarity with biomedical language, distinct disciplinary-bound approaches to research in the mathematics community, and 'artificial' academic boundaries aimed at 'preserving subject integrity' can hinder developments in this line of interdisciplinary research. The secondary objective of this symposium is to provide a platform so that intelligent exchanges among applied mathematicians, biomedical engineers, and clinical scientists can take place, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations. A concerted effort will be made to include underrepresented students and early and middle-career mathematicians in the symposium. Using existing resources available at the Michigan Technological University, the organizers will work together with the Center of Diversity and Inclusion and other partners to recruit students who are typically from economically-disadvantageous backgrounds to attend this symposium. In addition, it is planned to create a future network of support and interaction among participants to enable further research and collaboration.

"With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Valentine Vullev of the Departments of Bioengineering, Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, Riverside, is developing new ways for improving the efficiency of desired charge-transferring processes while suppressing the undesired ones that lead, for example, to losses in solar-energy-conversion devices and materials. Charge transfer processes are essential, not only for sustaining life on Earth, but also for many modern technologies such as solar energy capture. Electric dipoles inherently affect charge transfer. The ubiquitous nature of dipoles, therefore, warrants deep understanding of their effects on charge transfer. Professor Vullev's group will develop optical approaches for probing and mapping the localized nanometer-scale electric fields around dipoles. Such knowledge would allow the Vullev team to quantify the dipole effects on charge transfer and to map out ways to benefit from such effects. The project lies at the interface of organic chemistry and bio-inspired molecular engineering, and is expected to provide research team member with valuable interdisciplinary training.  The Vullev research group is active in outreach activities involving K-12 students, and aspires to include students from groups that have been underserved in science.  

This project has two objectives: (1) to develop spectroscopic approaches, using electrochromism, i.e., optical Stark effects, for probing and mapping molecular dipoles. This knowledge will allow experimental quantification of the extent to which the potentials of the electron donors and the acceptors are affected by the dipole-generated fields; (2) to study how dipole magnitude and orientation influence charge-transfer kinetics. A key pending question that this project seeks to address is the extent to which dipole effects on the rates of charge transfer change for processes with different thermodynamic driving forces, in relevance to the reorganization energy. Bio-inspired molecular electrets (systems with ordered electric dipoles) composed of different anthranilamide residues are the key structural motif for the systems designed for study in this project.   In the long term, this project aims to establish important structure-function relationships for optimizing charge transfer processes of interest, allowing the molecular engineer to suppress undesired events, such as charge recombination, in the design of the system. If successful, the results this research project could impact a broad range of scientific areas, including energy conversion, bioenergetics, molecular and organic electronics.

"With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Track1: Pilot PPP aims to improve the academic performance of first-year biology students at Bloomfield College, promote their retention, and ultimately, their graduation rates, which will in turn contribute to the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. Approximately 30% of students enrolled as Biology majors at Bloomfield College self-identify as Hispanic. Only half of all first-year biology majors go on to complete a second year and only one-third graduate with a degree in biology. Furthermore, the 4- and 6-year graduation rates for Hispanic students are approximately half of that of other ethnicities. Therefore, this project will develop and implement interventions to support first-year students at two specific points in their college careers: during the transition from high school to college and during the first year of college. Specifically, incoming first-year students will participate in a week-long intensive Biology Summer Enrichment Program (Bio-SEP), a Peer Coaching and Tutoring Program, and participate in Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) during their first year at the college. The project will allow us to assess the impact of specific interventions on the academic performance and retention of first-year biology majors who have risk factors known to prevent graduation: being a first-generation college student, coming from a low-income family, and belonging to a minority group.

The project has two specific objectives: 1) to ease the transition from high school to college and prepare incoming Biology first-year students for the rigors of college work and 2) to support students’ academic performance and integration into the college while encouraging them to develop self-efficacy and their identity as biologists. Bio-SEP will give incoming first-year students a jumpstart on the content of the first-semester biology curriculum, teach them essential college study and social skills, and introduce them to faculty, staff, current students, peer coaches, and biology alumni. A faculty member will coordinate and lead trained peer coaches to deliver academic and social support via the Peer Coaching and Tutoring Program. In addition, students will participate in interdisciplinary CUREs delivered as laboratory modules in first-year introductory biology and chemistry courses. CUREs are well documented to help students develop confidence in their ability to perform basic scientific procedures, and increase their sense of belonging to the wider scientific community. The program outcomes will be evaluated continuously by monitoring grades, retention rates, and GPAs of all biology students who are impacted by the proposed interventions. Students’ developing attitudes towards science will be evaluated using nationally benchmarked pre-and post-course surveys. Assessing the impact of these interventions will provide us with new knowledge about how to enhance undergraduate biology education and how to build capacity at our College. Ultimately, it will enable us to prepare our biology students to compete in, and contribute to a more diverse and capable STEM workforce. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.

"With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Marc Knecht of the University of Miami and Anatoly Frenkel of Stony Brook University are combining chemical synthesis techniques and advanced analysis tools such as x-ray absorption spectroscopy to characterize the structure and function of specially designed peptides that are bonded to the surfaces of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are typically produced with a focus on the activity of the metals, but peptides on the surface could provide new functions. This is a challenging problem as these molecules must bind to the nanoparticle surface which can cause both the metal atoms and peptides to lose their activity. Professors Knecht, Frenkel, and their students are using bio-inspired design to tackle this challenge and use peptides that can bind nanoparticles and still present unique chemical activities.

"With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Marc Knecht of the University of Miami and Anatoly Frenkel of Stony Brook University are combining chemical synthesis techniques and advanced analysis tools such as x-ray absorption spectroscopy to characterize the structure and function of specially designed peptides that are bonded to the surfaces of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are typically produced with a focus on the activity of the metals, but peptides on the surface could provide new functions. This is a challenging problem as these molecules must bind to the nanoparticle surface which can cause both the metal atoms and peptides to lose their activity. Professors Knecht, Frenkel, and their students are using bio-inspired design to tackle this challenge and use peptides that can bind nanoparticles and still present unique chemical activities. Their discoveries could lead to new methods to prepare multifunctional materials where the properties of the molecules on the particle surface can work in concert with those of the metal.

"A near-universal aspect of cellular life is the non-uniform spatial distribution of molecules that make up cells, which most often takes the form of sub-cellular organelles. Organelles within eukaryotic cells are well defined spatial structures within cells that are specialized to perform defined biochemical tasks. Technological limitations have meant that the fundamental understanding of the underpinning principles that govern compartmentalization in cells is lacking. In this project, the investigators will address this oversight using a synthetic cell approach where new biological systems are constructed from molecular building blocks. Their hypothesis is that synthetic cells can become a unique and invaluable tool to study the fundamentals of organelles and cellular architectures. Working with Imperial College London, the investigators are developing a series of technologies and modeling tools that unlock the manufacture of synthetic organelles. Specifically, they are building and using synthetic systems to mimic the dominant feature of eukaryotes: the segregation of transcription and translation by the nucleus. The ability to assemble programmable membrane architectures, as well as integrating mathematical models, will allow the investigators to use the synthetic cells as a testbed to investigate outstanding fundamental questions relating to cell and nucleus biology.  Included in this collaborative project are two community objectives that leverage the rapidly emerging interest in synthetic cells, their creation, study and applications in both the UK and the USA: (1) Build an international bridge for the Build-A-Cell (USA) and fabriCELL (UK) consortia. This collaboration will serve as a focal point to shape the respective communities and ensure the cross-fertilisation of ideas, expertise, and personnel that is needed to achieve the grand challenge of building a synthetic cell from scratch. (2) Actively engage with beneficiaries in the life sciences, biotechnology, and microfluidics sectors. This will be achieved through a series of impact activities, including organising an industry/academic horizon scanning workshop, attending conferences and symposia, and participating in a host of outreach activities. 

The collaborative work between expert UK and US teams is designed to achieve five scientific objectives and two community objectives. The scientific objectives will directly build from existing pilot work in their research groups: (1) develop microfluidic and membrane engineering tools to build synthetic organelles and nuclei; (2) develop modeling platforms for the design and analysis of compartmentalized synthetic cells; (3) examine the effects of compartmentalization on coupled biochemical processes; (4) investigate how transcription dynamics are affected by compartmentalization in a nucleus; (5) explore rules governing the nucleus: cytoplasm volume ratio.  The first two objectives involve platform development for constructing and modelling synthetic organelles. The final three objectives involve using our platforms in fundamental studies relating to the role of cellular compartmentalisation and the central importance of the cell’s nucleus.

This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), where NSF funds the US investigator and BBSRC funds the partners in the UK.

"Chronic skin wounds resulting from burns, diabetes, ulcers, and other medical conditions can overwhelm the skin's regenerative capabilities, leading to persistent infections and even amputations in severe cases. Over 10 million patients with chronic wounds are treated yearly in the United States, with an estimated cost of more than US $ 40 billion in annual spending for treatment. Accurate diagnosis of chronic skin wounds, particularly in the early stage, can provide efficient and targeted treatment, ultimately reducing patient suffering. Current burn wound diagnosis and prognosis are limited to visual inspection by the physician and patients are physically required to be in the medical center to undergo expensive wound imaging approaches or the excruciating process of repeated bandage removals for inspection. Even with the latest advances in health, smart bandages can only aid in drug releases and do not provide real-time diagnosis nor monitoring. This proposed research aims to overcome the obstacles associated with existing burn wound profiling by developing transformational imaging and wound monitoring approaches that can be readily integrated with existing smart bandages to provide real-time information of the wound state without affecting their daily routine. This project will also foster workforce development in the rapidly growing area of bio-medical wireless engineering. New degrees and new curricula in biosensing and IoT technologies will be leveraged to promote STEM outreach programs and coordinate outreach activities. The latter will be aimed at recruiting larger cohorts of undergraduates and K-12 students from the local Miami-Dade and Broward counties to be trained in wireless engineering. Examples of our signature outreach programs to be leveraged include Engineers on Wheels, Engineering Expo, ENLACE (Engaging Latino Communities for Education), and the Miami PREP (Positive Youth Preparedness) programs.

Accurate diagnosis and prognosis of a skin wound treatment commonly require the measurement of the wound area, maximal wound depth, the chemical composition of wound exudate, and type of tissue affected. In addition, sensors for non-intrusive diagnosis need to overcome the following challenges, namely 1) attenuation provided by bandages, 2) adherence to regulatory requirements while employing radio frequency (RF) sensors, 3) avoiding battery-powered electronics, and 4) accurate diagnosis across demographics. The proposed development of a non-intrusive, affordable, wireless real-time wound assessment device that can be easily integrated to a smart bandage is transformative as it unites the interdisciplinary research areas of biomedical engineering, network engineering, and electromagnetism towards a single goal. Specifically, the PI will be working closely with bio-medical researchers towards the, 1) Development of mmWave sensing system to estimate skin wound depth with ~0.1 mm accuracy, through electrical impedance spectroscopy, by computing the variation of the skin impedance as the wound depth varies, and 2) Realization of IoT-based wireless connectivity employing low-power low-cost protocol to transfer vital wound healing details obtained using integrated electrical, electrochemical and RF mmWave sensors, in a reduced SWAP-C package. The proposed research capabilities have the potential to revolutionize medical imaging tools for remote assessment of skin burn injuries, ulcers, and other chronic skin wounds, benefiting the global society by realizing a safe, accurate, and self-reliant burn-wound monitoring system.

"Due to their small size, microorganisms perceive a fluid as much “stickier” than do fish or humans. Such small creatures must adopt a different strategy for efficient swimming. Many of them propel themselves in the fluid by wiggling micro-structures such as cilia and flagella. The remarkable efficiency of microorganisms at moving and navigating through a surrounding fluid has inspired recent construction of microfluidic devices for mixing and transport, and micro-machines for drug delivery and manipulation of cells. Since theoretical analyses and experimentation are challenging in this setting, mathematical modeling and numerical simulation have become indispensable in these developments. This project aims to create improved computational and visualization tools for advancing understanding of the motility of microorganisms and our capability to harness this process. The project will develop an interactive three-dimensional visual computing system to serve as (1) a research tool for studying the hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms, (2) an engineering tool for testing and improving the design of artificial, bio-inspired micro-swimmers, and (3) an educational tool for introducing students of all levels to this field. The project will also provide direct training and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and high school teachers. The project includes plans to develop virtual reality games based on microswimmers to be exhibited at the Museum of Science & Technology as well as public libraries. 

Research objectives in this project include the development of an efficient, multigrid-like method for manipulating the large, dense matrices arising from the simulation of interacting micro-swimmers, a data-driven, reduced order model for tracking fluid particles, an efficient numerical method for optimizing the design of bio-inspired swimmers given a task, and a three-dimensional interactive visual computing system for real-time fluid visualization and manipulation. Multigrid methods exploit the geometry of the swimmers and are therefore expected to be more efficient than current numerical approaches. An artificial neural network will be leveraged as a data-driven, reduced order model for the change in a fluid particle’s position. This approach is intended to simulate a fluid particle's trajectory very efficiently, since it does not require calculating fluid-structure interactions, an important aspect in real-time and/or multi-query scenarios. The planned numerical optimization method takes advantage of both the reliability of a genetic algorithm at finding global optima and the efficiency of a gradient-based method when a good initial guess is given. The interactive visual computing system is intended to serve as a virtual laboratory for analysis of the effects of parameter changes. This project is jointly funded by the Computational Mathematics and the Mathematical Biology Programs of the Division of Mathematical Science.

"MicroRNAs are short RNA molecules (~20 to 24 nucleotides) that function to regulate levels of gene expression in animals and plants. The targets of microRNAs function in many key cellular processes, including development, biotic and abiotic stress responses. In crop plants, microRNAs have demonstrated roles supporting phenotypes important for fertility and yield, and thus contribute to food security and the agricultural economy. As with all features of genomes, cataloging and tracking microRNA genes consistently and across genomes using appropriate gene names is crucial. This requires uniform and rigorous assignment of identifiers, periodic reassessment and screening using the latest criteria, and community input. It is crucial that different publications and databases use the same name for a particular microRNA, and homologs in different species should ideally receive consistent names. A single, central registry for microRNA nomenclature and quality control has existed since 2004 to name and catalogue microRNAs: miRBase. miRBase faces challenges in the current era of 'big data'. In particular, registration of new microRNAs currently relies on time-consuming, manual curation. Inexpensive sequencing of genomes and small RNAs has massively increased the discovery rate of microRNAs, exceeding the capacity of miRBase for manual curation of new entries. Yet the need for a single trusted resource is more acute than ever, for rapid registration of new microRNAs, and to assess both existing annotations and new. 

This collaborative project between the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and Pennsylvania State University in the US and the University of Manchester in the UK will develop an autonomous and automated microRNA registry system for miRbase. This will be integrated with miRBase naming protocols and adding additional quality controls. The project will resolve a critical problem for the continued growth of the small RNA field, particularly in plants. By automating submission, curation, and release of new annotations, this project will eliminate the current reliance on time-consuming manual annotations to maintain miRBase. This will allow miRBase to continue to catalyze fundamental discoveries in all areas of biology. The project will thus build on existing tools to annotate high-confidence microRNAs from plant small RNA deep sequencing datasets. The project will develop a pipeline to automatically assign consistent gene names to novel plant microRNA annotations generated by users from these deep datasets. And the project will incorporate new interfaces into the miRBase infrastructure to accept and display user submissions of novel microRNA data, and to expand options for users to visualize data. An output of the project is training researchers in the analysis of biological big data and full stack web development -- skill sets in high demand across the sciences and beyond.

"Modern discoveries and advancement in biology and medicine are enhanced by the use of engineered materials that mimic the structural, mechanical, and biochemical complexities of human tissue. The research supported by this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will generate new knowledge as the investigators leverage light-based three-dimensional printing to address three key barriers that currently limit the fabrication of biomimetic materials: toxicity of printing resins, tunability of properties, and ability to create features that span biologically relevant length scales. This research project will expand the breadth of tools available for manufacturing advanced biomaterials and facilitate the development of products and devices that enable better diagnosis, study, and treatment of numerous diseases and conditions. The project also includes the creation of a community of historically underrepresented and underserved rising researchers, from high school to graduate school. Participants will be connected across the educational continuum by a cooperative mentoring network and will engage in learning and research opportunities related to 3D-printed biomaterials. As such, the project will help to enhance the diversity and technical strength of the biomaterials manufacturing workforce. 

Although photo-manufacturing is a promising technique for the creation of advanced biomaterials, its use is limited by several major barriers: i) many traditional photoinitiators are biologically disruptive, ii) controlling mechanophysical properties across the micro- and meso-scale continuum is challenging, and iii) innovation is hindered by historical underrepresentation of some groups in STEM and insufficient practical training opportunities. The research team will address these limitations by quantifying both the efficiency and cytocompatibility of biosourced photoinitiator candidates in two-photon polymerization (micro-scale) and digital light processing (meso-scale). Additionally, the team will develop mathematical relationships between crosslinking rate and final feature properties, then employ these relationships to determine appropriate methods for coupling micro and meso printing to create multiscale features with continuous and predictable mechanophysical properties. Furthermore, the research team will help to enhance the diversity and technical skill level of the medical device and manufacturing workforce by creating the “3D Printing in Bioengineering Rising Researcher Community.” This community will include education and research engagement opportunities at all levels, with a strong emphasis on cooperative mentoring and professional development. The research and educational activities are tightly integrated: scientific discoveries will be applied to student-driven projects, and student creativity in these applications will spur innovation for future advancements in photo-manufacturing and applied fields. Overall, the outcomes of the project are expected to have a significant positive impact by catalyzing the advancement of photo-manufacturing for biological applications and enhancing workforce diversity and technical strength in manufacturing and biomaterials. This project is jointly funded by the Advanced Manufacturing program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

In nature, biological systems can constructively respond to mechanical force, such as the healing of skin after a cut. Taking this as inspiration, this project aims to develop force-responsive synthetic polymeric materials that can remodel after force is applied. The goal is to externally regulate the extent of force-triggered activation and remodeling using carbon dioxide as an external stimulus. To do this, the material will include two components. One component is designed to respond to carbon dioxide by swelling and the other includes force-sensitive groups called mechanophores, which will remodel the material in response to the extent of swelling. Using this approach, the project describes systematic studies examining the structure-property relationships that underlie mechanophore activation and their time scales in polymer networks. This project will help advance research towards developing materials offering enhanced safety, longer lifespan, and reduced environmental impact. The project will also include educational and outreach activities including mentored research opportunities for undergraduates from diverse backgrounds attending a primarily undergraduate institution (PUI), the development of a hands-on module based on this project for a technical elective in polymers, and the implementation of a career module to expose students to career paths in the field. Further, this project supports hosting two visiting graduate students who have interest in a career at a PUI for the summer to begin building the skills needed to develop an undergraduate-driven research program.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

The ability of biological systems to respond constructively to mechanical force inspires the design of mechano-responsive polymer networks that similarly elicit constructive responses. However, strategies to develop synthetic materials capable of force-triggered remodeling remain limited. This effort will take a stepwise approach towards regulating mechanochemical activation using an external stimulus in double network (DN) hydrogels. Using a DN structure, external control will be afforded by a carbon dioxide (CO2)-responsive primary network, which regulates the extent of mechanochemical scission in the secondary network via swelling. CO2-regulated, force-triggered activation of the mechanophore will be coupled to a subsequent crosslinking polymerization to strengthen and remodel the material in response to deformation. This system will be used to determine the structure-property relationships that govern mechanophore activation and kinetics, which may enable new strategies to study mechanochemistry in basic and applied research.

Educational and outreach components of the project include: 1) enhancing undergraduate education and training; 2) enriching graduate professional development; and 3) building research infrastructure and enhancing educator development. The first area includes providing mentored research opportunities for undergraduates of diverse backgrounds attending a PUI, development of a hands-on module and career module targeted towards undergraduates enrolled in a technical elective focused on polymers, and hosting a workshop to aid undergraduates in submitting competitive applications to a fellowship program. The second area includes hosting two visiting graduate students who have interest in pursuing a career at a PUI for the summer to gain first-hand experience of conducting research at a PUI and to begin building the skills needed to develop an undergraduate-driven research program. The third area focuses on developing and disseminating materials to prospective and new faculty at PUIs to help them perform and fund their research.

"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

The Division of Materials Research supports Professor Krzysztof Matyjaszewski at Carnegie Mellon University to prepare and study controlled interphases between the surface of liquid or solid substrates and well-defined polymers synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The substrates include liquid metals such as eutectic gallium-indium alloy (EGaIn), artificial solid electrolyte interphases and solid polymer electrolytes in lithium metal batteries, as well as surfaces of swollen nanogels, macrogels, and vesicles. Two main ATRP techniques will be used, grafting-from and grafting-onto. Precise control of interphases is challenging due to a very small amount of available materials. However, the interphases define many critically important properties related to stability of the sub-micrometer layer, interactions with both neighboring phases, dispersability of nanoparticles, transport phenomena, (bio)compatibility, friction and other properties affecting macroscopic performance. Materials prepared in this project should have several interesting applications depending on the substrates. Liquid metal functionalized systems could find potential uses to enhance properties of materials used for soft robotics and as solid electrolytes for lithium metal batteries. Highly functional resin particles will be used as novel recyclable supports for solid phase polymer synthesis and also in synthesis of bioconjugates. In addition to these scientific activities, this work has broader impacts through education and outreach. In this project, Professor Matyjaszewski will train postdoctoral fellows, graduate, and undergraduate students in polymer synthesis and polymer interphases with potential applications in energy storage, soft robotics, and bioconjugations. He will also provide public education about preparation and importance of controlled interphases via instructional webpages and videos. 


TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

With support from the Division of Materials Research, Professor Matyjaszewski and his team will explore preparation of controlled interphases between the surface of liquid or solid substrates and well-defined polymers synthesized by ATRP. He will investigate the effect of precise anchoring on the substrate surface of either functionalized polymer chains or ATRP (macro)initiators followed by polymer growth, as well as their influence on the properties of interphases. He will use polyacrylates with ether linkers between oligo(ethylene oxide) chain and polymer backbone, which are much more hydrolytically stable than well-known isomeric polymethacrylate with oligo(ethylene oxide) chains linked by ester moiety. This will provide enhanced stability of polymers and related networks and an additional possibility of introducing to the polymer backbones other functional groups, such as acids, amides, hydrazides, alcohols and several other moieties for specific applications. Professor Matyjaszewski will also introduce branching to polymeric grafts and crosslinking to artificial solid electrolyte interphases to suppress growth of lithium dendrites and enhance performance of lithium metal batteries. The grafting-from and grafting-onto by ATRP will be applied to swellable gels and liquid metals. Thus, he will use ATRP to graft polymer chains of different architecture (linear, branched and crosslinked) from liquid droplets of eutectic gallium-indium alloys, swollen nano- and macroparticles, and vesicles. Highly functional resin particles will be used as novel recyclable supports for solid phase polymer synthesis and as easily removable sacrificial initiators in synthesis of specialized bioconjugates. Therefore, the precise control of polymers at interphases at solid and liquid substrates will provide attractive materials for soft robotics and for energy- or bio-related applications.

"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

There is a critical need to understand the intrinsic relationships between chemical structure and the bulk physical properties of bio-based polymers. This is especially true so that biologically-derived materials can be designed to mirror the properties of petroleum-based plastics. Terpenes, which display a rich variety of structures, are valuable building blocks for preparing polymers that lend themselves to such systematic structure-property studies. This proposal entails the synthesis of novel polymers that are derived from terpene feedstocks, as well as the characterization of their fundamental properties in order to connect molecular and mesoscale structure to performance. Emphasis will be devoted to understanding how backbone connectivity and orientation modulate the thermal and mechanical properties of terpene-based (co)polymers. The insights achieved during this work will accelerate the development of biologically-derived plastics with precisely tailored properties and functions. Moreover, this work could shed new light on how unique structural elements can be leveraged to design a wide range of polymers with targeted properties. This research will be integrated with a broader effort to promote science literacy and engage academic and public communities at the state and national levels. A multifaceted plan will develop new curriculum initiatives, promote collaborative learning, and promote science literacy through web-based platforms (i.e., YouTube) by connecting research outcomes to real-world applications and challenges.


TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

There is a critical need to understand the intrinsic relationships between the rich structural complexity of bio-based polymers and their physical properties. This is especially true in the context of designing biologically-derived materials that can mirror the properties of petroleum-based plastics. Terpenoids, which display a wide range of carbocyclic structures, are valuable platforms for preparing polymers that lend themselves to systematic structure-property studies. Indeed, polymers comprised of rigid carbocyclic motifs (e.g., cyclic-olefin copolymers) are enticing materials that exhibit unique (and, in certain cases, predictable) physical properties. Unfortunately, the limited scope of carbocycles that can be incorporated within macromolecular architectures has significantly hindered efforts to systematically probe more subtle structure-property relationships. This research seeks to elucidate the interplay between constitutional isomerism, backbone stereochemistry, and bulk  thermomechanical properties in terpenoid analogues of cyclic olefin (co)polymers. The work is expected to dramatically expand the chemical space available to polymer science and reveal fundamental insights into an unexplored family of biologically-derived polymers. The insights gained from this research will accelerate the development of biologically-derived plastics (including thermoplastic elastomers) with precisely tailored properties and functions. This research will be integrated with a broader effort to promote science literacy and engage academic and public communities at the state and national levels. A multifaceted plan will develop new curriculum initiatives, promote collaborative learning, and promote science literacy through web-based platforms (i.e., YouTube) by connecting research outcomes to real-world applications and challenges.

"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY 
This CAREER Award supports the research and integrated educational efforts toward developing a new theoretical framework to guide the design of intelligent, responsive materials that mimic living organisms. Intelligent responses allow an entity to smartly discern and respond to the complex spatial and temporal changes of surroundings. For example, a bacterium can actively gather information from the environment and swim toward foods or flee from toxins. Such intelligent responses, ubiquitously observed in living organisms, must operate far from the steady state of thermal equilibrium. So, they cannot be described by the equilibrium theory of classical thermodynamics. Instead, a novel non-equilibrium theory is required to explain and predict the intelligent responsiveness in the fundamental building blocks of materials – molecules. 

The main aim of this project is to develop a non-equilibrium theory to quantitatively predict the intelligence of a molecule’s response to external stimuli. The theory will capture the relationship between the intelligence of the molecule’s response, its robustness to environmental noise, and how far it needs to be driven away from thermal equilibrium. To accomplish this aim, the research team will combine numerical simulation techniques with the modern theory of non-equilibrium physics. In addition, the team will construct generic toy models that distill the essential dynamics of molecules’ non-equilibrium responses. This project will lead to a set of fundamental and generic statements and predictions as design principles for intelligent materials. These activities will provide students with a cross-disciplinary training program combining mathematics, statistical physics, chemistry, and biophysics and mentorship and professional development skills.

The PI and the research team will partner with the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill to engage the public. This collaboration involves outreach activities such as Family Science Day and Launch Lab events to make the scientific principles behind the research available to the students and teachers in middle schools, kids and families, and the public.


TECHNICAL SUMMARY
This CAREER Award supports the research and integrated education to elucidate the design of microscopic information machines that autonomously sense, memorize, and respond to spatiotemporal patterns of external stimuli, such as pH, temperature, and chemical environments. These microscopic machines will serve as fundamental building blocks of next-generation novel materials and smart nano-robots. Attaining this goal will transform the field of novel functional and active materials by imparting life-like attributes to otherwise inert molecular complexes and deepen our understanding of thermodynamics, information, and intelligence in the chemistry, biology, and material science communities.

Living organisms, maintained far from equilibrium by constantly dissipating energy and producing entropy, can actively sense, memorize, and respond to complex information hidden in environmental conditions. Biological systems have evolved to utilize diverse ingenious nonequilibrium mechanisms to maintain robust and accurate performance, typically at the cost of energy dissipation or the speed of response. The strategic goal of the research is to elucidate nonequilibrium mechanisms of energy extraction, information sensing and storage, noise resistance, and robustness in connection to entropy production and to develop a universal theory to predict and optimize the performance of generic microscopic information machines. Specifically, this research will address the following questions: What are the general nonequilibrium thermodynamic principles behind these mechanisms? What are the possible mechanisms to better extract and dissipate energy for the optimal performance of smart materials and intelligent molecular complexes? What can one learn from the physical understanding of biological systems to help the design of artificial molecular complexes to achieve similar or better information processing?

The specific aims of the research are to (1) use a hybrid energy landscape approach to describe the nonequilibrium flows of energy caused by a time-varying environment, and (2) find the thermodynamic limit of memory capacity in macromolecular complexes and general relation between the ability of pattern recognition and system’s energy-landscape complexity as reflected in its topology and geometry, and (3) lift the ideal-environment assumption to include the backaction from the system and the thermal fluctuations, and understand the counter-intuitive stochasticity induced comprehensive sensing mechanism.

The research activities are closely integrated with education and outreach efforts: both graduate and undergraduate students will be exposed to cutting-edge tools and concepts via direct involvement participation in a novel course module of “thermodynamics of information processing” that is to be included in the re-designed course “Thermodynamics and Introduction to Thermal Statistics”. The PI will collaborate with the Center for Faculty Excellence at UNC to acquire knowledge and guidance regarding the up-to-date educational tools and methodologies and obtain frequent quantifiable evaluations to guarantee the success of the re-designed course. The PI and the research team will work with visitors and high school teachers and students in North Carolina by collaborating with the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center on Family Science Day and during the Launch Lab events. Morehead will provide evaluation data to the PI that examines the extent to which the event’s main communications goals are met and provide further guidance on improving the public's engagement.

"PART 1: Nontechnical Abstract:

As bio-inspired ligands for various biological targets, aptamers present key promising advantages over antibodies including their low immunogenicity, animal-free generation, reversible denaturation, and longer shelf-life. Moreover, while research and financial investments in therapeutic antibody development and manufacturing have clearly overshadowed that of aptamers, oligonucleotide ligands still hold promising potential as advantageous targeting and even inhibition agents for challenging viral targets whose rapid spread and mutation capabilities can unfortunately outpace traditional therapeutic developments. In the absence of a priori rules to identify potential binding motifs within a self-hybridized oligonucleotide for a non-nucleotide target, finding the right aptamer (or set of aptamers) for a particular target is a daunting search problem, much like finding the right move in a game of Chess or Go, largely because the candidate sequence space is staggeringly large. Thus, in the absence of any chemical guidelines, researchers traditionally choose instead to simply maximize the sequence diversity among candidate aptamers by employing screening libraries consisting of large heterogeneous populations (~109 or more) of random DNA or RNA sequence members in a resource-intensive screening process called SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential Enrichment). Here, the goal of the proposed work is to develop a pipeline of candidate DNA aptamers for spike protein. To undertake this ambitious goal for this pilot project we will pioneer an integrated experimental and informatics approach to rapidly and reliably identify DNA oligonucleotide ligands from informed, designer libraries for a viral protein target called the spike protein. 

PART 2: Technical Abstract:

Research and financial investments in therapeutic antibody development and manufacturing have clearly overshadowed that of lesser known, oligonucleotide-based ligands called aptamers. Aptamers, on the other hand, hold promising potential as advantageous targeting and even inhibition agents for challenging viral targets whose rapid spread and mutation capabilities can unfortunately outpace traditional therapeutic developments. In the absence of design rules, finding the right aptamer (or set of aptamers) for a particular target is a daunting search problem, much like finding the right move in a game of Chess or Go, largely because the candidate sequence space is staggeringly large. Thus, in the absence of any chemical guidelines, researchers traditionally choose instead to simply maximize the size (~109 or more different sequences) of screening libraries in a resource-intensive, evolutionary screening process called SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential Enrichment). To overcome these challenging technical and scientific bottlenecks inherent to this popular aptamer screening platform, we propose to pioneer an integrated experimental and informatics approach to rapidly and reliably identify DNA oligonucleotide ligands from designer libraries for a viral protein target called the spike protein. The proposed integrated experimental/computational aptamer discovery approach is intentionally adaptable using a “lessons-learned” approach to pave the aptamer discovery pathway for viral targets, particularly as viral strains readily mutate. This work will offer unique, multidisciplinary student training opportunities in the experimental and computational aspects of the work. If successful the PIs believe this pilot project will lay the fundamental groundwork for future accelerated bio-inspired ligand discovery to enable desirable bioactivity of materials systems.

"Sutures in biological systems play an important role in resisting high impact and hazardous vibrations. Examples of these sutures can be found in woodpecker beaks and plant seedcoats. At a much larger scale, certain engineered seawalls using gabions resist impact from breaking waves and control erosion. Inspired by biological sutures and engineering gabions, a new family of composite materials named ‘sutural gabions’ are researched in this project. Compared to traditional materials, the new designs are expected to significantly mitigate adverse effects from impact and vibrations. This new family of composite material designs is expected to have broad applications in the next generation of shock-proof materials. These could be employed in applications ranging from built infrastructure to biomedical materials. As a result, the new knowledge generated from this project will advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare. By integrating mechanics, materials science, and additive manufacturing, this project will also provide training opportunities to diverse groups of students. The researched outreach efforts will also provide hand-on activities relating to engineering, sciences, and arts. 

The project will focus on revealing the fundamental mechanics behind the superior dynamic properties of biological sutures and engineered gabions. This will be accomplished by developing a comprehensive framework providing impact-resistant phononic sutural gabions. Fully integrated approaches will be employed, including nonlinear finite element simulations, advanced multi-material 3D printing, and mechanical experiments via electrodynamic shaker, drop tower, and split-Hopkinson pressure bars. The project will generate new knowledge to expedite research in designing innovative structural materials with unconventional mechanical properties. By bridging mechanics and materials, the project will promote two research avenues: one focusing on protective multi-phase composites, and the other centering on soft phononic multi-functional materials.

"The immune system is one of the primary ways animals fight pathogenic microorganisms. Animals also live with millions of non-pathogenic microorganisms (their microbiomes) which cause them no harm. Accumulating evidence indicates that immune systems establish intimate relationships with these microbiomes, which may make the difference between life and death for an animal exposed to a pathogen. Amphibians exemplify the importance of studying interactions among microbiomes, immune systems and pathogens. Amphibians across the globe are dying from infection by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Bd infects the skin of amphibians and causes death by disruption of essential skin function. Amphibian skin microbiome and immune system components have been shown to independently relate to Bd infection outcomes. Yet, the interactions among host microbiomes, host immune systems and the pathogen Bd remain poorly understood. This microbial-immune interface is likely critical to determining Bd infection outcomes. The proposed research is unique and innovative because the investigators will combine laboratory experiments using three amphibian species that differ in Bd susceptibility with state-of-the-art molecular and analytical approaches. In this project, which is a collaboration between researchers at the Smithsonian Institution, George Washington University and George Mason University (US) and Bangor University (UK), the investigators aim to define the mechanisms controlling the microbial-immune interface and its effect on Bd susceptibility. They expect to demonstrate that amphibian skin microbiomes and host immune responses are interconnected, multi-facetted systems rather than discrete host and microbial entities.  

The central hypothesis guiding the proposed studies is that the interdependence of amphibian skin microbiomes and resident immune cell populations critically define Bd infection outcomes. The interdisciplinary research team will integrate microbial ecology, comparative immunology, meta-transcriptomics and proteomics at multiple experimental scales. They will combine these comprehensive system-level datasets with network analyses and structural equation modeling to examine the amphibian skin microbial-immune interface and its effect on amphibian susceptibility to the disease chytridiomycosis, caused by Bd infection. They will address their hypothesis by: 1) determining how skin microbiomes affect skin immune cell populations, 2) defining how skin-resident immune cells affect skin microbiomes, 3) resolving the contribution of the microbial-immune interface in Bd infection outcomes. They predict that key microbial-immune interactions strongly impact Bd susceptibility. Their findings will garner the much-needed understanding of the microbial-immune interface and how these interactions impact disease outcomes. Theirs will be the first study to simultaneously evaluate the relative contribution of the microbiome and immune system to chytridiomycosis in a causal framework. Vertebrate animals, including humans, are host to symbiotic microbes and complex immune system components. The resulting insight from these investigations will have broad applicability to a variety of other animal systems.

"The use of DNA-based technologies in complex biomolecular circuits is a quickly developing field of synthetic biology that has the potential to disrupt how one designs smart drugs or delivers targeted treatments. Given their biological nature and in-vivo compatibility, other applications for synthesized DNA-based computational circuits that cannot be foreseen now will surely follow. Recent advances in biotechnology have shown the potential for implementing complex DNA-based circuits. However, as the complexity of these circuits increases, they become slower and more difficult to be designed efficiently. As shown in silicon-based technology, new design approaches and automation tools are essential for progress in the field. This project aims to develop a systematic design framework and new approaches for fast and complex molecular computing circuits using fractional coding and to investigate the use of this framework for the efficient and scalable implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Along with the development of the design automation framework, a companion software, called FUNDNA, that maps mathematical FUNctions to DNA reactions will be produced. This freely available, open-source software with its tutorials and documentation will transform bio-design automation research by enabling efficient design of molecular circuits for complex computations with mathematical representation without requiring biological/chemical skills. The tool will make the creation of novel complex DNA computing circuits faster, cheaper, and more accessible. This project includes two major educational initiatives with the goal of broadening participation in STEM. First, students who are underrepresented in engineering fields  will be recruited through the Kentucky-West Virginia LSAMP program, the University of Kentucky (UK) Student Chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, and UK Student Support Services to be trained to work on the research project. A new course, Molecular Programming and DNA Computing Circuits, will be developed to integrate the knowledge and findings of this research and to help train students in the area of DNA computing. Second, an iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) chapter, the first iGEM team in the state of Kentucky, will be established to share resources and compete in international synthetic biology competitions. 
 
This project will enable systematic design of efficient molecular circuits for fast computation of complex mathematical functions. The design of molecular computing circuits will be systematic because the project will develop a new level of design abstraction that accepts mathematical representation of desired computations. It will create an end-to-end compiler that transfers the mathematical representation to chemical reaction network, and then generates candidate DNA reactions and sequences. The developed circuits will be fast because they work based on fractional coding. While for traditional molecular encoding each input/output is represented by a molecular concentration, for fractional coding inputs/outputs are ratios of pairs of molecular concentrations. Molecular circuits based on traditional encoding need to wait for the final (at equilibrium) concentrations of molecules, whereas for circuits based on fractional coding, the ratios reach their final values much faster than molecular concentrations. This project will expand the computational power of molecular computing circuits to complex computations through two approaches: 1) it will map all electronic stochastic computing logic circuits to molecular circuits, 2) it will implement finite state Markov chains by molecular reactions. Finally, the project will develop new approaches for performing ANNs with molecular reactions. The goal is to demonstrate how fractional coding can improve molecular computation, and DNA computing in particular, through three objectives. 1) Development of a design automation framework and a companion software, called FUNDNA, that maps mathematical FUNctions to DNA reactions. 2) Investigation of complex computations such as neural networks based on fractional coding. 3) Experimental DNA implementation of basic molecular computing circuits using fractional coding. This project will have a significant impact on the field of bio-design automation because it will introduce and attempt to realize the idea of automated design of molecular circuits, starting from high level mathematical or algorithmic representation. While there is prior work in molecular computation of different sorts of mathematical functions, no systematic method has been proposed for computing complex general mathematical functions within a molecular circuit.

The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a stronger understanding of how living things absorb carbon in the ocean. It is important to have an accurate measure of the natural carbon uptake by the ocean because this affects ocean and fishery health, as well as future efforts to intentionally sequester carbon in the ocean to mitigate climate change. This goal will be achieved by developing a low-cost sensor that can be widely deployed on ocean robots, which are already being used to measure processes like ocean heat uptake. The sensor will use light to detect sinking debris in the ocean.  This debris is a major way that carbon is naturally sequestered in the ocean. Distributed, robotic platforms in the ocean allow observations to be made in locations and seasons that are not accessible with research ships. Such platforms are generally lower cost than sensors associated with research ships. Development and sale of sensors for robotic platforms are areas of growth because of the increasing reliance on these platforms for scientific observations. This project may also enhance academic and industry partnerships and help to train upcoming scientists and engineers in instrument development.

There is a significant desire to expand measurements of ocean biological carbon pump processes to better understand climate change, in particular the flux of carbon by particles settling out of the surface ocean. This project will create a sensor that is designed to be carried aboard globally distributed, autonomous profiling floats.  The sensors/floats may help distinguish among the different modes of biological carbon uptake in the ocean. The sensor will be designed from the ground up to meet the challenges of sampling floats, which have stringent power consumption, cost, and data quality-control requirements. The sensor will also have specific optical and housing geometry characteristics tailored for measurement of sinking particle fluxes. The development stages will consist of optical modeling of proposed sensor geometries, modeling of particle collection efficiencies of different housing geometries, laboratory testing of model particles, and dissemination of results to the scientific community.

This REU Site award to the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras, located in San Juan, PR, will support the training of 10 students for 9 weeks during the summers of 2022-2024. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Undergraduate students in any STEM field, particularly individuals from groups historically underrepresented in science, are encouraged to apply. Students will participate in a scholarly environment throughout the summer including the presentation of their work to the research community at UPRRP. After participating in the program, students will be encouraged to present their work at national and international conferences. A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.

Participants will be immersed in a mentored research project that allows for the exploration of biology using computational and quantitative tools, such as: the application of statistics to the life sciences, the integration of quantitative analyses towards understanding molecular changes in organisms, and the use of big data and machine learning approaches to document the effects of climate change on biological systems. Through skill development workshops and hackathons, students will receive training and practice for fluency in research techniques related to data analysis and visualization, computing, and bioinformatics. Career development workshops will offer guidance in the process of applying to graduate school, obtaining funds for research, and exposure to concepts and theories that will help participants navigate career transitions in science. The criteria for evaluation of student application will be academic performance and a demonstrated interest in pursuing a career in science at the intersection of biology and computational sciences.

With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Sen Zhang of the University of Virginia is studying catalysts to efficiently oxidize renewable alcohols for the production of clean electricity and valuable chemicals. Clean energy is one of the central challenges of modern society. Renewable alcohols, such as ethanol, propanol, and butanol, produced from non-food biomass resources are important components of the United States energy strategic development plan for sustainable and affordable domestic energy resources. To utilize bio-renewable alcohols with higher energy conversion efficiency and lower carbon emission, this project will develop cost-effective catalysts that allow the bio-renewable alcohols to be designated as a carbon feedstock in electrochemical devices for electrical energy generation and chemical transformation. The knowledge obtained from this research will broadly benefit catalysis research for energy and environmental sustainability. The outcome of this project will accelerate the development and the scaled application of electrochemical devices, including fuel cells and electrosynthesis devices, potentially transforming the U.S. energy portfolio. Dr. Zhang’s research will be closely integrated with education plans and outreach activities, with an emphasis on the development of a “iCleanEnergy” pedagogical platform to enable active and customized learning for undergraduate clean energy education. The project will also involve educational outreach to minority serving institutions to increase minority participation in the energy sector. 

With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Sen Zhang of the University of Virginia is studying an emerging class of nanocrystals wherein multiple hetero-structured interfaces, including metal phosphide/metal (MP/M) core/shell and metal-metal (M-M) interfaces, are modularly integrated for electrocatalysis. By rationally designing and synthetically tuning these interfaces within each nanocrystal, this project aims to fundamentally understand interfacial effects on desirable electrocatalytic properties for the oxidation of biomass-derived alcohols, leading to the development of efficient catalysts for alcohol-fueled anion exchange membrane fuel cells and electrosynthesis devices. Dr. Zhang will leverage his team's abilities in advanced nanomaterials synthesis, structural characterization, electrocatalysis, and theoretical calculations to focus on three tasks: (1) optimizing the MP/Palladium core/shell interface to enhance the alcohol oxidation reaction by tuning MP cores; (2) modifying the palladium shell with carefully controlled palladium-M heterostructures; and (3) understanding the design rules for optimized alcohol oxidation catalysts through a combination of electrochemical and in-situ spectroscopic approaches. By taking an interdisciplinary approach, this project aims to address fundamental questions in catalysis and electrochemistry; in particular, how catalyst atomic structure and interfacial architecture correlate with catalyst activity, stability and selectivity.

"This project addresses a vital part of the U.S. public health infrastructure: lysate from horseshoe crab blood.  Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (lysate or LAL) is derived from the blood of horseshoe crabs, and is the only method approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to detect the presence of endotoxins in pharmaceuticals, surgical tools, implants, and vaccines.  By following the production of lysate from horseshoe crab harvesting through bleeding labs, pharmaceutical facilities, and regulatory bodies like the FDA and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC), this project will scrutinize the intricacies of natural resource conservation, regulation of the biomedical industry, and the relationships between ecological and medical science.  At stake in the debate over horseshoe crab fisheries are the ethics of environmental governance, protection of human health, and advancement of scientific knowledge.  As this research is being done at an institute of higher education, additional benefits of the project include direct input into environmental regulatory processes, enhancement of educational opportunities for students – including those in under-served communities – in environmental studies, and dissemination of research products to both academic and general audiences.


This project is a multi-sited, mixed-method study of the biomedical use of Atlantic horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus).  A derivative of horseshoe crab blood -- Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL or Lysate) – is used to test endotoxins in the bio-pharmaceutical industry. This project will focus on the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC or Commission) attempts to regulate the extraction and circulation of horseshoe crab blood as well as industry attempts to reduce mortality rates while continuing to harvest blood for LAL testing.  Through historical research, semi-structured interviews, and site visits, this project analyzes the complex political ecologies of a natural resource vital to human economies, coastal ecosystems, and public health.  This project asks: how do these marine organisms and their biomaterials circulate within and through different epistemological, legal, industrial, and bio-ecological pathways, and with what ramifications?  Understanding the intricacies of horseshoe crab conservation, public health regulation, and biomedical knowledge generation is not only relevant to the scientific and regulatory communities involved, but will be of intense interest to environmental humanities and science studies scholars.  A number of broader impacts are envisioned for this study, including undergraduate course enrichment, the opportunity to mentor students with related research interests, and ongoing work with underserved communities like the large Deaf/Hard of Hearing student population at RIT.   It will be of interest to environmental studies and science studies scholars, as well as stakeholders in the horseshoe crab industry and policy makers.

"This US RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) - UK Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe) collaborative project will significantly redesign existing open-source Molstar molecular graphics infrastructure to develop an extensible, one-stop-shop for visualization and interrogation of open-access three-dimensional (3D) structure data integrated from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), NextGen PDB, PDB-Dev, Electron Microscopy Data Bank, Electron Microscopy Image Archive, and BioImage Archive. Molstar works entirely with the users internet browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). It consists of an easy-to-use graphical interface with no user login or software product download, update, or registration required. The redesigned Molstar system will be FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) and FACT (Fairness, Accuracy, Confidentiality, Transparency) Principles compliant. It will support efficient data delivery and visualization and study of 3D structure data together with structural, biological, and functional annotations across length scales ranging from individual atoms to whole cells. Researchers, educators, and students accessing the new system will be able to combine, visualize, and evaluate structure data and related biological, medical, and chemical information from multiple open-access data resources. It will also support analyses of 3D structures of biomolecules their respective in organellar or cellular contexts Users of the redesigned Molstar infrastructure will be able to study macromolecular machines (e.g., prokaryotic RNA Polymerase-Ribosome Super Complex; eukaryotic Nuclear Pore Complex) in 3D in situ combined with biological and functional information integrated from a diverse array of open-access biodata resources operating in the Americas, Europe, Oceania, and Asia.

This project will address significant challenges resulting from the growing corpus of 3D structure data stored in disparate open-access primary data resource. These include the need for integration and interoperation of these data with related biological and functional annotations from knowledgebases; the need for a standard data representation for display of 3D structure data across length scales; the need to examine multiple 3D structures of biological macromolecules in groups of related structures coming from cutting-edge techniques such as serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy; the need to combine atomic level/multiscale structures with lower resolution information from cryo- electron tomography and super-resolution microscopy; and the need for efficient data packaging, compression, and delivery for users with diverse levels of internet connectivity. The project will overcome current limitations in data management, interoperability, and visualization that make it difficult, sometimes impossible, for molecular, cellular, and organismal biologists to fully utilize the world’s open-access 3D biostructure data. The software products of the project will be freely accessible at https://www.molstar.org. Utilization of the Molstar software will be exemplified within the web portals of RCSB PDB (https://www.rcsb.org) and PDBe (https://www.pdbe.org), which are available to all users at no charge and with no limitations on data usage under the most permissive Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

"Today's chemical, energy, and transportation industry is increasingly confronted with a depletion of fossil resources. In addition, anthropogenic climate change is strongly related to utilization of fossil oil, gas, and coal. For later generations, it is of major importance to valorize renewable carbon sources for industrial applications and avoid further increase of CO2 emissions. Biomass presents a promising renewable carbon source bearing the potential to create closed carbon cycles, with net zero CO2 emissions. With funding from the NSF Division of Chemistry, Professor Philippe Sautet of the University of California-Los Angeles, in collaboration with German colleagues at the RWTH-Aachen, is developing bio-based routes to fine chemicals. Renewable energy sources (solar, wind, etc.) already generate an excess of electricity and the electrochemical conversion of renewable raw materials into fine chemicals or fuel additives is one way of making sensible use of this excess. The chosen reactant, levulinic acid, is one of the twelve most promising platform chemicals identified by the US Department of Energy. The project focuses on its electrochemical transformation into pyrrolidones, important intermediates for pharmaceutical products, solvents, and polymers. In general, electrochemistry enables milder reaction conditions compared to chemocatalysis and provides the potential to integrate renewable electrical energy into chemical value chains. In the case of the proposed pyrrolidone synthesis, high hydrogen pressure can be avoided, and aqueous electrolytes are projected to facilitate an integration along the bio-refinery value chain. In addition to the broader socioeconomic impacts of the research outcomes on a sustainable economy and on climate, the international collaboration between the US and German research teams will provide the students involved in the research with a unique cultural and educational experience.

The project aims for an integrated experimental and theoretical investigation of the electrochemical amination of levulinic acid to produce pyrrolidones. The Sautet group will focus on first-principle simulations of the electrocatalytic surface reaction aiming for a comprehensive mechanistic understanding. The RWTH-Aachen group will experimentally investigate the transformation with emphasis on the influence of electrocatalyst and process parameters. The project will likely improve fundamental understanding of the mechanism of electrochemical amination.  It will also provide key insights into the factors controlling catalytic surface reactivity of the electrocatalyst. Finally, major process parameters will be explored experimentally. The major objective of this study is for the collaborative team to conduct a detailed mechanistic investigation. For this purpose, the reaction, which can be divided into three sub-steps, will be considered separately. First, the imine formation on model substrates, then the electrocatalytic hydrogenation to the amine and finally the condensation to the pyrrolidone will be investigated both computationally and experimentally. The proposed reaction pathway will be examined by detailed mechanistic studies and will be further investigated by comparison with model substrates. Acetone, for example, is a suitable model compound for the first and second reaction steps. However, deeper experimental insights will be given by variation of the chain length as well as  expansion of the functional groups present in the corresponding model substrates. Moreover, all experimental investigations will be accompanied by an optimization of the electrode material and the reaction conditions. A computational screening of different electrocatalysts will be performed, based on kinetic modelling and scaling relations.

This research was funded under the NSF-DFG Lead Agency Activity in Electrosynthesis and Electrocatalysis (NSF-DFG EChem) opportunity NSF 20-578.

"An award is made to Universidad Del Turabo to support student learning and research which has been severely impacted by several natural disasters including Hurricane Maria (September, 2017), the 2020 earthquakes (January, 2020), and the current Covid-19 pandemic.  The award will support stipends, supplies, and travel for three undergraduate students and one masters student studying the impact of Hurricane Maria on biodiversity across the elevation gradient of El Yunque National Forest.  The students will utilize a variety of genomic approaches to analyze soil core samples taken across 15 plots to study how microbial diversity changes along elevation gradients and whether Hurricane Maria significantly altered the biodiversity across the elevation gradient.  The students will particular use of an ABI 3500 Genetic Analysis platform acquired with a previous NSF MRI award (1726158).

Climate change can have a significant impact on microbial (fungi and bacterial) diversity by impacting surface litter, canopy openings, solar radiation, and winds.  The El Yunque National Forest, located in Puerto Rico, has been dramatically impacted by Hurricane Maria.  The El Yunque National Forest provides a natural setting for several forest types (tubonuco, palm forest, palo Colorado, and elfin forest), across its natural elevation gradient, with each forest type having its own endogenous biodiversity.  The University has created 15 forest plots from 300 to 1000 meters in elevation at 50 meter intervals.  At each elevation a 50 X 20 meter plots was established and divided into ten 10 X 10 plots.  Soil core samples were taken before and after Hurricane Maria from adjacent plots at each elevation.  The samples will be used to address two fundamental questions:  1) how does microbial diversity change along the elevation gradient and 2) how was microbial diversity effected by Hurricane Maria along the elevation gradient?  The students will extract DNA samples from each of the core soil samples and use a variety of specific primers to amplify gDNA from the samples to quantify the presence and abundance of specific microbial species.  DNA sequence analysis will be used to further identify and discriminate species providing insights into both elevation associated diversity and changes in this diversity as a result of Hurricane Maria.  
Students will obtain training in the use of a variety genomics techniques and laboratory equipment and will further strengthen current collaborations with the NSF-LTER at Luquillo, US Forest Service, DNA Learning Center (at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory), and Bio-Link (NSF-ATE BIO).

"Cell growth and division requires cells to polarize by forming distinct compartments with different molecular components. Faulty cell polarization contributes to birth defects or diseases such as cancer. The PI will develop stochastic and deterministic models to better understand how biochemical factors in the cell interact and regulate each other for proper cell function. This project will model the segregation of chemical reactions taking place on cell membranes and in the interior of the cell.  Such segregation is thought to give rise to interesting dynamical phenomena, such as oscillations of the central polarity regulator, Cdc42, and establishment of multiple polarity zones.  The effects of compartmentalization and geometry on the dynamics of polarization is just beginning to be explored and may lead to novel biological insights of how cell polarity is maintained in cells. The PI’s long term educational goal is to encourage female undergraduate and graduate students to pursue careers in STEM fields, specifically in Applied Mathematics.  Broader educational impacts will involve organizing a workshop for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Notre Dame. 

The PI will focus on establishment of polarity in fission yeast and budding yeast, two model organisms for understanding how cells integrate polarity and spatial coordination of growth. The current mathematical approach to modeling cell polarity using reaction-diffusion equations does not take into effect the spatial segregation of polarity molecules in the cell.  The goal of this project is to model cell signaling occurring during cell polarization by coupling bulk diffusion to active surface-bound chemical species. The PI will apply this bulk- surface PDEs  framework to specific scientific aims: (1) Extend the deterministic bulk-cytosol 1D model framework to a spatial stochastic one that describes the inherent noise in the underlying biochemical system, and compare model findings for increasing cell size and molecule number using compartment based SSA approach, (2) Extend the 1D framework to higher dimensions, where cortical domains are modeled as a thin patches to allow for lateral diffusion and the cytosol is modeled as an enclosed volume, and consider effects of cell geometry on intracellular signaling. The educational objectives of this proposal are: 1) organize a workshop for undergraduate women encouraging them to pursue careers in Applied Mathematics and other STEM fields, 2) participate in Women Leaders in STEM program at Notre Dame, 3) develop new materials for graduate course on Mathematical Cell Biology, which will be open to interdisciplinary students, 4) lecture in existing national educational programs such as the q-bio Summer School that introduces students from diverse disciplines such as mathematics, physics, and computer science to modeling in biology.

"Each field in the sciences has historically been represented by its own scientific society, bringing together individual researchers for regular meetings where they can network, share discoveries, and collaborate. While it is rare for multiple distinct scientific societies to interact, they often perform similar functions, such as promoting the professional development of their members and promoting diversity among the next generation of researchers in their respective fields. This project will establish a collaborative network of experts to identify evidence-based inclusion strategies to accomplish the following: (1) collect consistent demographic data of society memberships, (2) better integrate scientists in transitional career stages into scientific society activities, and (3) diversify the ranks of scientific society leaders. By fulfilling these goals, this project aims to overcome persistent challenges that frequently undermine diversity efforts within independent communities of scientists and to broadly share this information for the benefit of all scientific communities.

Scientific societies predominantly approach diversity and inclusion efforts by supporting the professional development of individual members who are from historically underrepresented groups in STEM. Unfortunately, data is lacking to evaluate the efficacy of these efforts, and additional approaches are likely to be required to address the systemic inequities underpinning skewed demographics among STEM practitioners. Fortunately, scientific societies that function as communities of practice (CoPs) are uniquely positioned to lead cultural change and promote inclusive environments to foster a diverse STEM workforce. This Research Coordination Network (RCN) project will use virtual town halls and in-person think tanks to expand and strengthen a cross-disciplinary network of CoPs. This network will collaborate to identify evidence-based strategies to address three persistent challenges that scientific societies face as identified by members of the Alliance to Catalyze Change for Equity in STEM Success (ACCESS): (1) lack of data to track scientific society membership demographic composition, (2) lack of integration of scientists in transitional stages of their careers into disciplinary CoPs, and (3) lack of diversity among highly visible thought leaders, including speakers in scientific programs. This RCN is coordinated by ACCESS and its member societies in the life sciences (the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, the American Society for Cell Biology, the American Society for Pharmaceutical and Experimental Therapeutics, the Endocrine Society, and the Biophysical Society), the Quality Education for Minorities Network, the Marine Biological Laboratories at Woods Hole, and the NSF INCLUDES Aspire Alliance. The resulting strategies and standards will be reported and disseminated through open access training materials and publications.

"Engineering of robots primarily relies on prescribed algorithms for centralized control. This results in robots with limited versatility because every function must be preprogrammed. Animals, by contrast, rely on adaptable neuronal networks distributed throughout the body that convert and modulate brain signals into specific and well-coordinated muscle actions and corrections. It has now become possible to record signals from these large neuronal networks in primates in the part of the spinal cord controlling hand function. Therefore, our goal is to extract the functional features of these neuronal networks, and validate their function by controlling bio-inspired robotic hands, as well as human cadaveric hands. This validation will allow the first physical test of the biological mechanisms for grasp function, and will help understand hand disabilities and treatments in, for example, stroke, spinal cord injury and cerebral palsy. It will also launch a new generation of versatile robots that use the mechanisms of our nervous system.

The overall goal is to create a synthetic functional analogue of the cervical spine that controls multiple grasp modalities in bio-robotic hands. This is made possible by the advent of specialized massively parallel computer chips that allow the implementation of networks of hundreds of simulated neurons and their spiking dynamics (neuromorphic chips). Therefore, in this project, we will extract network architectures for the control of the hand from the nervous system of primates (Japan) and implement them as neuromorphic circuits to create a new class of versatile robotic hands (USA). Using specialized recording system, will record neural data from hundreds of spinal interneurons and alpha motoneurons in the cervical spinal cord of awake, behaving monkeys during manipulation—while also recording EMG and hand kinematics. This will be the most complete data set to date for cervical control of the hand (Aim 1). Then, we will create neuromorphic implementations of that neural circuitry using state of the art very large scale integration chips. Special attention will be paid to implementing physiologically valid versions of alpha-gamma motoneuron interactions, and realistic plasticity rules. We will also create a Domain Specific Language that allows the translation of general neuroanatomical circuits into neuromorphic code to make this technology accessible by the general neuroscience community (Aim 2). We will test, refine and validate the neuromorphic circuits by using the neuromorphic chips to control neuro-robotic hands using electric motors programmed to behave as muscles, and sensors to replicate the function of muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs (Aim 3). We will also control cadaveric human hands to validate the neuromorphic controller for the anatomy of the human hand. This will pave the way to a better understanding of hand function and disability and serve as the proof of concept for a new class of neuromechanical robotic, prosthetic and brain-controlled hands.

"Every year, six U.S. undergraduate IRES trainees will participate in research and training programs at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, Tennessee, related to the development, properties and application of amorphous materials. Trainees will be chosen from the full-time students in the Physics, Engineering Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Geology programs at APSU. This student opportunity will culminate in a seven week summer research experience at recognized European universities in France, Czech Republic and Poland. Amorphous materials are key to future advancements in fields from lasers and fiber optics to the aerospace and automobile industries. Devices based on these materials can be found in the hardware that forms the backbone of our modern telecommunication infrastructure, including the internet. They are used in numerous advanced STEM areas including linear and non-linear infrared optics and photonics, chemical and bio-sensing, phase-change memory devices, nanolithography, and nano- and bio-engineering. US undergraduate students interested in careers in the science and technology of materials will acquire comprehensive theoretical and experimental training under faculty and staff with world-class expertise. Advanced professional preparation such as this is critical for students at public primarily undergraduate universities like APSU. These international collaborations will result in joint publications and conference presentations. Additionally, trainees will have new cultural and social experiences because of the interaction with the international student population at the host institutions. Students from minority and underrepresented groups, first generation and low-income students, as well as military-affiliated students (near 25% of the APSU student body) will be strongly encouraged to participate. The project is also of vital importance to the outreach and promotion of STEM education in Middle Tennessee. It will support the diverse intellectual and research environment at APSU and will help to train globally oriented and innovative future scientists, engineers, and educators. 

The Project funds an international interdisciplinary undergraduate summer research program focused on development of novel amorphous materials by a diverse group of APSU students in partnership with collaborators at three European institutions (University of Rennes I, France; University of Pardubice, Czech Republic; University of Rzeszow, Poland); each research group specializing in a distinct aspect of glass science and technology. These groups, when taken together, cover the complete material research and development cycle, starting with synthesis, followed by characterization, and ending with application. The project will expand upon the current long-term international scientific collaboration between APSU and these European institutions. The students' research will include advanced topics such as new functionality of amorphous materials doped with nanoparticles, nanostructuring of amorphous thin films, optimization of bioglasses, and developing a nanoscale insight into the molecular structure of amorphous solids. Nano-engineering of chalcogenide glasses is especially intriguing and may allow for the design of hybrid materials combining two or more useful properties in one functional medium. Undergraduate students will develop innovative research skills in modeling, synthesis, macro- and nanoscale characterization, and structural and functional modification of novel amorphous materials for cutting-edge applications. Results from this work will impact the development of novel amorphous materials as well as new hybrid nano-modified media for applications in photonics, electronics, even quantum computing. These efforts will contribute to deeper understanding of nanoscale phenomena in amorphous solids.

"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising therapeutic agents for a range of clinical disorders owing to their immunomodulatory and pro-regenerative functions. A major bottleneck in EV biomanufacturing is scalability during development of a product to achieve clinically relevant doses. Current practices rely on invasive manipulations of cells and culture conditions, which can have deleterious implications on the final product and can incur high cost and operate at small scales, making them less viable for best-practice manufacturing. This project will improve EV production through noninvasive mechanical stimulation of MSCs by delivering low magnitude mechanical signals to MSCs cultured in two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems. This project will identify cellular responses to biophysical modulations and evaluate improvements to overall secretome, EV production, and functionality. The project will not only add new fundamental knowledge on mechanotransduction in MSCs behind EV release, but also provide functional evidence for overcoming large-scale manufacturing challenges in EV production. Students from underrepresented populations will engage in research; this will help train and develop a strong and diverse future biomanufacturing workforce, together having wide-reaching impacts on education, science and engineering, and the U.S economy. This Future Manufacturing award is supported by the following Division/Programs and Offices: ENG/CBET, MPS/CHE, MPS/DMR, EHR/DUE, and OIA/EPSCoR.

Strategies to improve EV production include hypoxic culture conditions, serum starvation, and immortalization of MSCs – all of which have deleterious implications in cell integrity and functionality and operate at small scales, thus necessitating development of feasible methods to enhance manufacturing. This project is based on the scientific premise that MSCs are mechanosensitive cells responding to mechanical stimuli.  The central hypothesis is that delivery of mechanical cues/forces in the form of low-magnitude mechanical stimulation (LMMS) to MSCs can affect (i) cell membrane integrin-cytoskeletal interactions that regulate actin dynamics and vesicle transport, and (ii) alter intracellular calcium levels leading to consequential release of EVs. The project harnesses the mechanotransduction of external forces on actin via integrins/talin, and subsequent influence on EV machinery towards the overall improvement in EV secretion by MSCs. Based on preliminary evidence that mechanical signals increase overall MSC secretome and EV concentration, this Future Manufacturing project will investigate the mechanisms behind mechanically triggered EV release, and will determine qualitative and functional improvements in EVs secreted in response to mechanical stimulation. The project will establish a minimally manipulative biophysical method to scale-up manufacturing of EVs from MSCs through delivery of low magnitude mechanical vibrations. The three major objectives are (1) To evaluate the effects of LMMS-based biophysical cell modulation system on EV release and unravel underlying mechanotransduction changes in MSCs in response to LMMS; (2) To assess functional potency of LMMS-induced EVs for immunosuppression (in vitro) and tissue regeneration (in vivo) in a critical-sized calvarial defect model; and (3) Leverage research outcomes to support education and development of a skilled technical workforce in the state of Arkansas by engaging undergraduate, graduate, and middle school students in biomanufacturing education and research. The project will benefit the field of life sciences, manufacturing and bioengineering education and research, contributing to sustained U.S. competitiveness in EV biomanufacturing for research and therapy.

"More than 2/3 of Americans have to receive dental imaging routinely. Current dental diagnosis largely relies on dental X-ray/CT (computed tomography), with several major drawbacks: 1) current dental X-ray/CT fails to detect some critical diseases with high incidence rates: for instance, 34-74% of people have tooth cracks. Due to highly variable symptoms, crack is notoriously difficult to be diagnosed even for experienced dentists. 2) the ionizing radiation of dental X-ray was found to increase the risk of meningioma, thyroid cancer, and delivery of low-birth-weight baby. Ionizing radiation is more concerned in children, as they are required to take 3-6 times more frequent dental X-ray/CT, and in dental professionals, as they operate X-ray/CT much more frequently, than normal patients. 3) It is also challenging to hold bulky X-ray/CT sensor immobile by many people, such as children. This project is to address these drawbacks by developing a novel dental imaging scheme with a lab-designed sensitive near-infrared fluorescence photonic imaging system, consisting of a high-resolution camera and a spectroscopic device, for real-time dental imaging. In addition, this project will teach students and educate the general public on the cutting-edge bio-imaging knowledge to help them tackle practical challenges, such as COVID-19.

The project goal is to develop a sensitive near-infrared fluorescence imaging system, including a high-resolution camera and a spectroscopic device, together with nanofluorophore, to image critical dental structures and diseases, including those undetectable by state-of-the-art dental X-ray/CT, in real time, and to eliminate the risks of ionizing radiation and the necessity of biting bulky sensors immobile. To achieve the goal, the following approaches are to be used: 1) Design a high-resolution dental imaging system and study the fundamental mechanism of dye distribution in dental tissues and the impact of dye distribution on imaging performance; 2) Systematically compare this dental imaging scheme to other state-of-the-art imaging modalities on critical dental diseases and structures on both animal and human teeth; 3) Optimize the dental imaging strategy with indocyanine green delivery by mouthwash. The research activity of this project has intellectual significances in several aspects: A) This research advances interdisciplinary knowledge. First, this research may advance the fundamental understanding of bio-distributions of dye in soft and hard biomaterials. FDA-approved near-infrared dye, the indocyanine green, is well understood for the distribution into soft tissues via blood and lymphatic circulations. However, how indocyanine green is distributed into hard structures, such as teeth, remains unknown. This study will investigate the indocyanine green distribution approaches in hard structures, how the biodistribution is affected by imaging factors (for example, dye dosage, observation time) and how these factors may quantitatively impact the imaging performance. Second, this research advances the fundamental understanding of how hard and soft biostructures interacts with different electromagnetic waves (such as near-infrared I (700-1000 nm), near-infrared II (1000-1700 nm), and X-ray) and how these interactions impact the choice of electromagnetic waves and imaging parameters when imaging various dental diseases. B) This work is innovative in the field of dental imaging. This work employs FDA-approved indocyanine green as a biocompatible near-infrared II fluorophore to facilitate the translation of human applications, and a user-friendly “mouthwash” delivery of dye, as opposed to the traditional intravenous injection; both are the pioneering works in the field. C) This work is transformative. In contrast with the current dental X-ray/CT (10-2-101 nm) imaging, this works uses completely different light (700-1700 nm) to eliminate the ionizing radiation, thus leading to the revolutionary change of dental practice by providing continuous real-time dental imaging at various angles/distances without health concerns.

"Non-technical Abstract

Bioprinting, printing with living cells, of three-dimensional tissue has immense future potential, but progress of this emerging technology is limited by a lack of biomaterials that have the necessary mechanical properties to be printable while also having the appropriate biochemical properties to interface with living cells. In particular, biomaterials that enable perfusion, the transport of oxygen, nutrients, and other life-sustaining components, is critically lacking. The need for perfusable structures is perhaps best demonstrated through blood vessel networks, which are required to deliver oxygen and nutrients to living tissue. Perfusable structures are critically important for many other tissues throughout the body including the lymphatic system, airways, and the gastrointestinal tract. To achieve the next generation of printed tissue, this project will develop a family of biomaterials that enable a new biofabrication strategy termed Gelation of Uniform Interfacial Diffusant in Embedded 3D Printing (GUIDE-3DP). The GUIDE-3DP materials will allow rapid fabrication of perfusable networks of interconnected channels with precise control over their shapes and sizes. In Aim 1, fluid-perfusable structures with complex branch points, such as mimics of branched blood vessels will be printed. In Aim 2, materials for gas-perfusable structures will be developed. As a case study, a human intestinal tissue will be printed and evaluated for the transport of oxygen through the printed living material. In Aim 3, materials that enable fabrication of continuous vessels with precise variation of the internal diameters will be developed. As case studies, printed models of (1) vascular stenosis (in which a region of the blood vessel is constricted) and (2) the large intestine (which has a repetitive, pouch-like structure) will be printed. These biomaterials will enable the future fabrication of living tissue mimics for a variety of applications that advance, biomaterials, biotechnology, national health and will further position the US to have global leadership in the emerging field of biomanufacturing. 


Technical Abstract


Perfusion, and specifically perfusion-enabling biomaterials, remains one of the most critical challenges in the formation of three-dimensional (3D) multicellular structures, whether for the purposes of tissue engineering, in vitro models of organ development and disease, or fundamental studies of cell behavior. The challenge of fabricating channels with specified geometry are important for multiple tissues throughout the body, including blood vessels, lymphatics, airways, and the gastrointestinal tract. To address this challenge, this project will develop a family of biomaterials that enable a new biofabrication strategy termed Gelation of Uniform Interfacial Diffusant in Embedded 3D Printing (GUIDE-3DP). Embedded 3D printing involves the fabrication of desired structures within a support material, reducing deformation and buckling due to gravity and enabling the printing of complex structures. The GUIDE-3DP method builds upon this approach by developing an interfacial diffusant strategy to rapidly fabricate perfusable networks of interconnected channels with precise control over the branching geometry and vessel diameters. In Aim 1, fluid-perfusable structures with complex branch points are fabricated. As a biological case study, endothelial cell morphology and phenotype in the bioprinted branch structures will be characterized, with a focus on how matrix mechanics alters cellular response to fluid shear stress. In Aim 2, gas-perfusable structures for controlled oxygen concentration will be fabricated. As a case study, a 3D human intestinal organoid culture model will be printed and evaluated for the role of oxygenation in regulating intestinal stem cell fate. In Aim 3, continuous vessels with precise variation of luminal diameters will be fabricated, as this geometry commonly occurs in many structures in vivo. As case studies, in vitro models of (1) vascular stenosis (in which a region of the blood vessel is constricted), and (2) the large intestine (which has a repetitive, pouch-like structure) will be printed.

"Non-technical summary

How do small animals like ants and scorpions so easily puncture human skin, while humans would have a difficult time biting through similar skin, even with their vastly stronger jaw muscles? The answer is that organisms with small muscles focus their tiny forces using very sharp mouth parts, stings and claws. But, sharp tools are easily damaged, and if an organism is not strong enough to cut with blunted tools, damage and wear may be fatal. Because of this pressure, special materials may have evolved to help small organisms make sharp tools and keep them sharp. Humans may learn from these materials, and use this knowledge to improve human-made materials. A good candidate for such a material was recently discovered in scorpion mouth claws. This material may minimize and even “heal” damage and wear of the cutting edges. This grant will confirm and further study the composition of this scorpion material by disassembling the material nearly atom-by-atom using Atom Probe Tomography. The material is thought to contain two different minerals, iron phosphate, and zinc hydroxide, as well as a protein component that contains about 10% zinc. The hardness and other mechanical properties of the new material will be investigated using techniques that can measure these properties for tiny samples.  In addition, the behavior of the sharp edges during cutting will be studied using a testing device that is integrated into an electron microscope and cuts and punctures with the claws. The scorpion material is strengthened by zinc-histidine cross links, which act like cross beams strengthening a building, but these cross links are sometimes broken under the pressures of cutting. One possible reason for the large quantities of extra zinc is to quickly repair broken zinc-histidine cross links. In addition, the zinc hydroxide may fill in and bond opposite sides of developing cracks. The electron microscope will allow visualization of wear, damage and self-healing during cutting, and the testing machine will measure the forces required for repeated puncture. The scorpion material will be compared to other materials like human-made blades and tips, and the researchers will investigate how the scorpions make the material by examining scorpions at various stages of development.  In addition to potential contributions to materials technology and materials science, this project will further the understanding of the importance of materials in biology, bridging the fields of material science and organismal biology. A graduate student and dozens of undergraduates will also receive research training through this project.

Technical summary

Small animals often overcome force limitations using very sharp mouth parts, stings and claws. But, sharp tools are easily damaged, and if an organism relies on sharp tools for defense or food acquisition, damage and wear may be fatal. The project will investigate a recently discovered complex biomaterial in scorpion mouth claws that may have evolved to produce sharp structures while minimizing and possibly “healing” damage and wear. Atom Probe Tomography will be used to confirm and extend the preliminary findings, which suggested that the material contains two different biominerals, iron phosphate, and zinc hydroxide, as well as a histidine - rich protein that binds Zn in ~10% concentrations. Nanoindentation will be used to measure hardness, modulus of elasticity and damping (loss tangent), and a puncture/cutting tester will be installed inside a Scanning Electron Microscope in order to visualize how the material wears during the puncture/cutting process, and whether the claw tips and edges have self-healing properties. The self-healing hypothesis is that broken zinc-histidine bonds re-establish in a manner similar to the minute-scale healing of zinc-histidine bonds recently discovered in mussel byssal threads. The rate of repeated punctures in the puncture testing machine, and repeated indentations with the nanoindenter, will be varied in order to investigate self-healing. One possible explanation for the presence of zinc hydroxide is that it acts as a ready supply of zinc for this self-healing mechanism, helping bonds re-establish quickly. A cyclical breaking and re-establishing of many zinc-histidine bonds could act as a damping mechanism, absorbing energy that might otherwise be available for fracture. Finally, scorpions will be examined at various stages of development in order to begin to understand how they produce this complex material. In addition to the potential of inspiring new materials technology and materials science, this project will further the understanding of the importance of materials in biology, bridging the fields of materials science and organismal biology by translating material property differences into differences in required force and muscle mass. A graduate student and dozens of undergraduates will also receive research training through this project.

"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

Infections by bacterial pathogens, especially those that are resistant to antibiotics, represent a major threat to the public health in this country, with millions of people suffering from the infections and a significant number of deaths each year. Thus, there are urgent demands for alternative approaches to prevent the spread of such infections. Nanomaterials-based approaches hold promise to serve as antibacterial agents against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. This collaborative project will develop and establish the newly discovered photoactive nanomaterials, specifically carbon dots (CDots) and derived “hybrid dots” (with other components),  as a uniquely potent biomaterials platform for killing MDR bacteria. CDots are of a core-shell structure, each with a nanoscale carbon particle as the core and organic molecules as the coating on its surface (shell). When exposed to human-friendly visible/natural or ambient light, CDots generate radical-like species that are highly lethal to bacterial pathogens, making them excellent bio-nanomaterials for antibacterial applications. This project will use some new strategies to design CDots and hybrid dots to improve and optimize the antibacterial performance, with expected broad positive impacts to the control of MDR pathogens, and also to the training of students in the important biomaterials field.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

This collaborative project is to further develop and establish carbon dots (CDots) and derived hybrid nanostructures as a unique biomaterials platform for visible/natural or ambient light-activated potent antibacterial function. CDots may be considered as a special kind of “core-shell” hybrid nanostructures, each with a small carbon nanoparticle core and a thin shell of attached organic materials for the particle surface passivation. They are strongly absorptive in the visible spectrum, and their photoexcited state properties and processes resemble those typically found in semiconductor quantum dots, but with unique advantages. The versatility and flexibility of modifying the dot surface with organic moieties enable the manipulation of CDots to enhance their optical properties and their interactions with the targeted bacterial cells. The project team will leverage these distinctive characteristics to design and prepare CDots and derived hybrid nanostructures for the desired properties based on the rationales including 1) the more effective photon harvesting across the entire visible spectrum, 2) highly efficient photoexcited state processes responsible for the antimicrobial activities, and 3) more targeted and stronger interactions with the bacterial cells, thus to establish the CDots/hybrid dots as effective and efficient broad spectrum agents for killing multidrug-resistant pathogens. The efforts will be coupled with investigations for mechanistic understanding of these bio-nanomaterials. The project will also have broader impacts in terms of societal benefits and technology development, institutional research enhancement, education and engagement of undergraduate students in research, and outreach activities.

"Photosynthesis powers life on Earth, providing all of our food, oxygen and most of our energy. The general principles underpinning the first steps of photosynthesis have been conserved by evolution; a protein network, termed the antenna, captures solar energy and delivers it to a dedicated protein, the reaction center, where electricity is generated. Remarkably, these steps can occur with almost 100% quantum efficiency. Recent observations suggest that nature may achieve this high efficiency by utilizing wavelike transport of absorbed solar energy from the antenna to the reaction centers. However, the presence and role of such quantum mechanical phenomena in natural systems are highly debated. One challenge to characterizing their impact has been that experiments on the antenna were performed in non-native and isolated solutions. In this project, which is a collaboration between researchers at the Michigan Institute of Technology (US) and the University of Sheffield (UK), the investigators will attempt a step-change in our understanding by investigating how solar energy is transported within the native network. These experiments will simultaneously uncover the mechanisms that give rise to efficient capture and conversion of solar energy to electricity and identify the interactions that enhance or repress the underlying quantum behaviors.  They will then seek to exploit these natural design principles to build non-native systems with enhanced abilities to propagate energy efficiently over increased distances. These studies will thereby lay the groundwork for improving energy transport in biohybrid and semi-conductor devices for application to emerging technologies relevant to consumer electronics, solar energy capture, quantum computing, quantum communications and photocatalysts. The project will simultaneously train the next generation of researchers at the biology/physics interface and disseminate the fascinating fundamental science underpinning natural solar energy conversion to the general public.

In photosynthetic light harvesting and solar energy conversion, the protein architecture involved varies dramatically with species, yet the general design is conserved; a network containing light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) absorbs and transfers energy to a reaction center (RC) for charge separation. Remarkably, absorption to charge separation can occur with almost 100% quantum efficiency. Experimental observations of oscillations within the excited state manifold led to a body of theoretical work that suggested the high efficiency is, in part, due to quantum coherence. However, the measured oscillations have been increasingly assigned to vibronic coherences, and experimental evidence of quantum coherence or its role in light harvesting has been elusive. To date, experiments have all been performed on isolated LHCs and RCs, yet these proteins function natively within a network. Furthermore, non-native interactions introduced through lithography have been shown to enhance the properties of the LHC, including energy transport and oscillator strength from exciton-plasmon coupling. Thus, the behaviors within the native network as well as the ability of non-native interactions to impact this behavior have not been investigated. In this project, the investigators will use different in vitro platforms to replicate the native network and introduce non-native interactions for different combinations of photosynthetic proteins. They will use advanced spectroscopy and microscopy to characterize excited-state properties, energy transport, solar energy conversion, and network geometry. The results will provide a blueprint for how nanoscale organization and interactions direct energy for light harvesting and solar energy conversion.

"The ability to spatially organize, separate, and sort is key to any advanced manufacturing process. While these tasks have been mastered in top-down industrial biochemical processes, it remains challenging to embed these operations in biochemical reactors at the micro- and nano-scale. Microscopic reactors are useful to extract, sort, separate, and organize components in low-volume, low-cost reactions, and are particularly relevant for scarce, toxic, or high-value ligands. This project will establish design tools and components to build microscopic liquid reactors made with DNA and RNA, taking inspiration from cellular condensation phenomena that compartmentalize small molecules, nucleic acids, proteins, and entire reaction pathways.  By developing a technological blueprint to build DNA and RNA condensates, this research will promote the adoption of this powerful approach in biotechnology, pharmaceutics, and chemical engineering, and contribute to the generation of a new workforce. Toward this goal, undergraduates will be involved in the research and the research will be integrated in educational modules that will be tested at Pasadena City College, UCLA, UCSB, and Caltech, and will be made available to the general public. 

This approach takes advantage of the well-understood thermodynamic and kinetic properties of nucleic acids to systematize the innovative technology of biological condensates. The project aims to: (i) develop DNA and RNA condensates into a future manufacturing technology; (ii) engage undergraduates and develop and disseminate educational tools for preparing a workforce to actively participate in this emerging technology; and (iii) expand the capabilities for domestic manufacturing of high-value biomolecules. Building on advances in DNA and RNA nanotechnology, the project will contribute libraries of DNA and RNA monomers that condense into liquid droplets that host specific molecules and pathways that are relevant for separation and production. Experiments will be guided by predictive models for design of customizable host condensates, and through a design-build-test pipeline will demonstrate liquid separation of an expandable set of molecules, cells, and pathways that are relevant for sensing, drug manufacturing, and healthcare. The team of PIs includes leaders in the field of DNA self-assembling systems (Rothemund), engineered DNA and RNA reaction networks (Franco), biophysics of nucleic acid systems (Fygenson), and biochemistry education (Blatti). Because nucleic acids are naturally present in living organisms, it will be possible to seamlessly integrate the operation of the custom artificial condensates with that of cells and tissues.

"The Biochemical, Environmental, and MOlecular Research in Engineering (BEMORE) REU Site at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) will prepare students to address knowledge gaps, develop new technologies, and bring unique perspectives to complex problems at the interface of biochemical and environmental systems. In particular, the BEMORE REU Site award will support 10 undergraduate students per year for 10 weeks of research training and professional development in the summers of 2022-2024. The innovative REU Site structure involves five interdisciplinary teams of two faculty mentors (from different departments), two REU students, and two peer mentors (from different majors). The interdisciplinary projects developed by BEMORE faculty will address grand challenges in antibiotic resistance, sustainable plastic replacements, smart polymers, urban air quality, and bio-based sensors. In addition to promoting the progress of science, these projects advance national health, prosperity, and welfare. To amplify the new voices and perspectives needed to address these grand bio-environmental challenges, the team will recruit cohorts consisting of (at least) 50% female or non-binary students and (at least) 50% students from underrepresented minorities. The professional research training that students receive through the BEMORE REU Site will enable them to pursue advanced interdisciplinary topics in graduate school or the workforce.

Grand challenges in sustainable development and public health require improved cooperation between scientists and engineers, but undergraduate students are rarely trained to work with collaborators from other disciplines. To remedy this situation, the BEMORE REU Site will (1) engage students in interdisciplinary projects that address grand challenges at the interface of biochemical and environmental engineering and science, (2) train students in the foundational tools, cutting-edge techniques, and scientific concepts needed to address the aforementioned challenges, (3) educate students to effectively communicate with researchers in their own field, scientists in other disciplines, and the general public, and (4) support students’ professional development through research outcomes, networking activities, and regular feedback from faculty mentors, peer mentors, and other REU students. Students will build interdisciplinary research competencies during the project through multiple levels of student-student and student-faculty interaction. In the three-year BEMORE REU Site, the team aims to facilitate (at least) 60 conference/meeting presentations from the 30 REU students and generate (at least) 10 peer-reviewed publications with REU student co-authors in high-impact journals. Formative and summative assessments will be used to evaluate student outcomes and ensure that students will “be more” prepared to tackle the most daunting challenges of the 21st century.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project is in addressing the pressing problem of herbicide drift. For years, farmers growing organic, non-genetically modified (non-GM) and specialty crops have incurred crop damage and financial losses due to drift of volatile herbicides, such as dicamba. The EPA estimates that up to 70 million pounds of pesticides, including herbicides, are lost to the environment due to drift each year. In 2017 alone, 3.6 million acres of soybeans were destroyed due to dicamba drifting away from its site of application. This project addresses the problem with a novel technology that reduces herbicide volatility and drift. This technology will help farmers growing GM-crops who face litigation because they spray drifting dicamba, and those who grow non-GM-crops and do not want drifted dicamba to impact their produce. Agrochemical companies currently facing EPA restrictions, product bans, and billions of dollars in lawsuits, can use this technology to improve the application efficiency of their products. This technology offers significant environmental benefits. Furthermore, beyond its agricultural use, the bio-based formulation is a platform technology that may be used to develop other applications from food to pharmaceuticals to cosmetics.
 
The innovation proposed in this STTR Phase I project is a bio-based emulsion adjuvant, derived from renewable resources, with the combined functionality of a drift control agent, buffering agent, and surfactant, to reduce the volatility and off-target movement of herbicides, and improve their efficacy. The proposed adjuvant offers encapsulating, environmental and financial benefits relative to the state of practice.  The project has the following objectives to evaluate and demonstrate the technical feasibility of the innovation: 1) develop and optimize the composition of the formulation, 2) characterize properties important for its use in herbicide spray mixtures, such as surface tension, thermal stability, fluid flow, water conditioning and defoaming behavior,  3) conduct humidome tests and field trials to validate the effectiveness of the formulation with respect to fine spray droplets suspended in the air  and herbicide activity against pigweed (Palmer amaranth), using dicamba as the model herbicide, and 4) determine the biodegradability profile of the formulation in soil and water environments and its aquatic toxicity.

"The goal of this project is to synthetically (artificially) control the behavior of the cell ""cortex""—the outermost layer of the cell. It is the cortex that normally powers many fundamental biological processes, both within single cells, and in tissues and organs. Completion of the project will result in four important research outcomes: first, it will test current ideas about how living systems execute such processes as cell division, cell movement, and cell shape change. Second, it will provide new tools and technologies that permit manipulation of cell behavior in living organisms. Third, it will provide the means to promote new, and potentially beneficial cell behaviors. Fourth, it will result in the development of new computational approaches for the analysis and understanding of complex cell behaviors. Successful completion of the project will also lead to several important educational and training outcomes. This project, which is a collaboration between researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (US) and the University of Edinburgh (UK), will support the training of two postdoctoral researchers and one graduate student in cell, molecular and computational biology, further preparing them for careers in science. Moreover, an additional four-six undergraduate students will be trained in cell and molecular biology, preparing them for careers in science or medicine. Finally, four under-represented and financially underresourced high school students will be trained in cell and molecular biology for two consecutive summers and provided with additional training on how to succeed in college. The training is anticipated to provide these students with the analytical and quantitative skills needed to excel in science, technology, engineering, and medicine related majors and, presumably, eventual careers in these areas.

The cell cortex is responsible for responding to a variety of internal and external signals with the appropriate mechanical behavior. Such behaviors include cell division, cell locomotion and short or long-term cell shape changes. This team and others recently discovered a dynamical process—cortical excitability—that a variety of cell types harness to drive distinct mechanical behaviors. Cortical excitability is outwardly manifest as propagating cortical waves of actin assembly and complementary waves of the various macromolecules that control actin assembly. Cortical excitability is itself controlled by coupled fast positive feedback and delayed negative feedback. We will develop the means to synthetically induce cortical excitability in cells that do not normally display it, namely, frog oocytes, and employ high-resolution live cell imaging to capture the detailed features of excitability. The induction will be based on synthetic protein constructs engineered to produce either fast positive feedback or delayed negative feedback. These constructs will be capable of generating different cortical excitability regimes either globally (ie throughout the entire cortex) or locally (ie in distinct regions of or patterns in the cortex). By combining different synthetic constructs, we will drive simple cell shape changes (ie furrowing) or complex cell shape changes (ie gastrulation), allowing us to test basic ideas about cell shape control. In addition, by iteratively combining experiments with computational modeling of the results, it will be possible to develop both a quantitative, mechanistic understanding of processes such as cell division and morphogenesis. This research will be of interest to those working in a broad variety of scientific disciplines, ranging from cell and developmental biology to computational modeling, to physics. Moreover, because the data generated will be extraordinarily rich in information, we anticipate that it will serve as a resource for many other researchers interested in dynamical behavior.

"The history of civilization is often described by the materials used: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, the Age of Plastics, and the Silicon Age.  Materials shape our architecture and art, transportation, clothing, the way we harness energy, produce and store food, and, most recently, technologies from electronics to medicine.  Assessing the sustainability of the materials our society produces is a global challenge.

"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will develop a climate-resilient design concept for slope maintenance using vetiver grass. In many cases, agencies cannot perform repairs of shallow slope failures due to limited budgets, which often leads to more expensive deep-seated failures. On the other hand, a slope showing early signs of failure, such as cracks, could be repaired and strengthened using low-cost, environment-friendly deep-rooted vetiver grass. This study will transform the slope repair paradigm from reactive to proactive enhancing safety and resiliency of infrastructure through a bio-inspired, sustainable approach. The project will be carried out at Jackson State University (JSU), one of the nation's leading Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), creating numerous opportunities for African American students to participate in research and explore careers in engineering. High school teachers and students will be involved in the project through a summer research program and workshops. Online educational resources and live events on social media will reach out to greater audiences around the country.

The goal of this research is to understand the vetiver grass root-soil interaction as a bio-inspired and climate-resilient solution to stabilize shallow slope failures in expansive soils. The project investigates (i) interactions of the deep-rooted grass with highly plastic clay at the micro and macro levels to resist cracking behavior; (ii) the role of the deep-rooted grass in the soil water balance and enhancing matric suction during infiltration and evapotranspiration; and (iii) the strength of the grass root-soil system. Model tests and field studies will be performed under different rainfall conditions to investigate the water balance within a slope covered with deep-rooted vetiver grass. The understanding from the model tests and field studies will be extended through numerical analyses to evaluate the coupled action of vetiver grass as reinforcement and vertical path for evapo-transpiration under different rainfall and weather conditions. All the collected data will be analyzed in an Artificial Intelligence-based Deep Learning Platform to develop the next-generation climate-adaptive slope repair model, which will connect weather stressors, soil data, field monitoring data, and strength properties of vetiver grass. Finally, a climate-adaptive design protocol for repairing and maintaining slopes using vetiver grass will be developed.

"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project combines biological experiments, mathematical modeling, and physical modeling to reveal the performance capabilities and constraints of legged locomotion in small invertebrates. When viewed on a relative scale, the fastest legged animals on the planet are the smallest of invertebrates. Organisms such as beetles, cockroaches, and mites are capable of running at speeds of tens to hundreds of body lengths per second. These remarkable feats of movement at the microscopic scale are enabled by strong limbs, robust foot attachment mechanics, and resilient exoskeleton structures that give these organisms locomotor capabilities vastly different from their larger counterparts. Yet smaller organisms also have to contend with incredibly complex and unstructured substrates that can impose step-to-step height variations equal to or larger than their leg length. This research will develop general principles of legged locomotion in complex environments which could contribute to the development of new legged robots that can move more effectively in unstructured environments. In parallel with the research aims, educational experiences for K-12, undergraduate, and academic professionals to better integrate living systems literacy into engineering curriculum will be developed. These activities include funded summer research experiences for underrepresented students in collaboration with a local Title 1 high school. At the college level, course development, hands-on training for undergraduate and graduate students, and interdisciplinary workshops for researchers in engineering and biology will be implemented. The overall goal of these efforts is to enable engagement, communication, and collaboration between engineers and biologists, facilitated through living systems literacy. 

This research project uses modeling and experiment to develop new geometric and dynamic scaling principles for legged locomotion in centimeter- and millimeter-scale organisms. Experiments will be performed with invertebrates that vary in size by four orders of magnitude in mass (the American cockroach, the Argentine ant, and the mite). To develop geometric scaling principles between animal morphology and natural substrates, a new experimental substrate-scanning platform to identify the three-dimensional topography of natural substrates will be developed. To study the dynamic scaling principles of force production and acceleration, new force measurement platforms to measure the ground-reaction forces involved in microscale legged locomotion will be developed. These experiments will be supported by physical modeling and computational modeling to elucidate scaling laws for dynamic and geometric phenomena in legged locomotion. The combination of experiments, modeling, and theory will improve our understanding of the biomechanics of microscale legged locomotion. The overall aim of this work is to contextualize the regimes of legged locomotion across the microscopic to macroscopic scales. The research and educational aims of this work are highly interdisciplinary. Graduate and high-school students will receive extensive training in biomechanics, physics, and engineering. Students will present results of these studies at robotics, physics, and biology conferences, and the outcomes will be published in interdisciplinary journals. Thus, the broader impacts include more focused understanding of legged biomechanics, new inspiration for legged robots, new understanding of natural substrates, and training of interdisciplinary scientists. 

This project was co-funded by the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program in the BIO Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, the BIO Division of Biological Infrastructure Innovation Program, and the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology Program in the Engineering Directorate’s Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation Division.

"This Future Manufacturing Research Grant (FMRG) EcoManufacturing project will comprehensively characterize optimal mix designs for 3D printed earth materials and structures, linking microstructural development and soil science with material and structural property characterization and optimization of 3D printing methods. Earth materials are an emerging, sustainable alternative to cementitious materials because of their low embodied carbon, affordability, safety, and thermal characteristics. By using minimally processed materials and sourcing raw materials from the construction site, 3D-printed earth structures could substantially reduce transportation, chemical treatments, excess manufacturing, warehouse storage, and intermediary storages that are inextricably intertwined with cementitious materials. Using a range of bacterial and biopolymer binding agents, as well as bio-based fibers and nano-fibers reinforcing additives, this project will characterize printable mixtures of earth- and bio-based building materials—modernized versions of ancient technologies—as a critical step for climate-friendly digital manufacturing of the built environment. In addition to creating new scientific knowledge for additive manufacturing using nonconventional materials, this project supports education and diversity by developing a graduate earth-based technology course and an extracurricular experience for students from marginalized communities that includes hands-on materials assessment, digital fabrication of an earth-based shelter, and community activities.

Through a comprehensive series of optimized mix design development, fresh- and hardened-state properties characterization will produce an effective and sustainable framework for improved shape stability and interlayer properties of the final printed earth structures.  The proposed research links, for the first time, the following multi-scale investigations to advance the science and engineering of 3D printed earth materials and structures: (1) establishing the soil characterization and microstructural design methodologies of 3D printable earth mixtures, (2) elucidating the process-structure relationships of 3D printed earth materials and the effects of additives, including a range of biomineralizing microbes and biopolymers, on fresh-state properties, (3) characterizing the hardened-state properties with a focus on alternatives to stabilization, and (4) advancing the processing science of small- and large-scale 3D printed earthen structures. This research and educational effort will contribute to a broader interdisciplinary scope on quantitative and qualitative expertise related to the automated construction, mechanical, thermal, and environmental impacts of earth materials, a critical future in low-carbon and affordable buildings.

"This project aims to enable rapid manufacturing of oral vaccines against viruses in plants without the need of specialized equipment or skills. Current vaccine manufacturing technologies need expensive laboratory facilities and cold-chain delivery systems that result in slow and unequal access of vaccines to people. This study combines ideas and approaches from the engineering of particles, chloroplast genetics, and plant molecular farming, to turn chloroplasts of edible plant leaves like spinach or lettuce into biomanufacturing devices for vaccine production. The project will increase public awareness of how engineered particles can be used to turn plants into a biomanufacturing technology through science outreach events and publicly available videos. It will also provide unique opportunities for postdoctoral researchers and students to grow beyond their disciplinary background and practice team science and technology development. A new college level course on engineering plants with engineered particles will incorporate these plant biomanufacturing findings into its curriculum. Partnerships with industry will inform the design, applicability, and cost-effectiveness of plant biomanufacturing technologies, and provide valuable networking and education opportunities for students and postdocs. Plant biomanufacturing hybrid meetings will promote integration of key stakeholders from academia and industry. Together, these approaches will train a future biomanufacturing workforce prepared to develop and apply fundamental knowledge and skills to solve major health, environmental, and sustainability problems.

This project aims to develop tools that allow rapid synthesis and universal access of oral mRNA vaccines manufactured in situ by plant chloroplasts. There is an untapped potential for utilizing chloroplasts as ubiquitous solar powered molecular factories for personalized biomanufacturing devices enabled by emergent nanotechnology-based tools. Chloroplasts are biomanufacturing organelles with a prokaryotic-like genome, their own transcription and translation machinery, but lack gene silencing mechanisms. This system enables high expression of transgenes in plants for rapid, tunable, and scalable manufacturing of mRNA vaccines anywhere plants grow. Despite great strides made in biotechnology, chloroplast genetic engineering remains limited to a few plant species, impairing the use of plants as widely accessible biomanufacturing devices. The main method for the introduction of recombinant DNA to chloroplasts in plants is costly, and requires materials and equipment that are only accessible to specialized lab facilities. Existing methods are also destructive, inefficient, and unable to target genes into chloroplasts. Novel technologies are also needed for facile encapsulation and retrieval of mRNA vaccines synthesized in plants in non-laboratory conditions. The study will investigate biocompatible and degradable high aspect ratio nanomaterials with controllable dimensions, tunable surface charge and chemistry as plasmid DNA delivery vehicles for turning edible plants into mRNA vaccine biomanufacturing devices. Orthogonally, it will determine if mRNA synthesis in chloroplasts and encapsulation in the organelle double lipid envelopes provide a layer of protection from degradation in the environment. Partnerships with industry will inform the design, applicability, and cost-effectiveness of plant biomanufacturing technologies, and provide valuable networking and education opportunities for students and postdocs. Students from UC Riverside, a minority-serving institution, will be recruited to participate in the project. A new course on plant nanobiotechnology at UC Riverside will incorporate the findings of this project on plant biomanufacturing into its curriculum. Nanobiotechnology-based approaches have the potential to democratize the use of plant chloroplasts for personalized biomolecule manufacturing and revolutionize the treatment of human and animal disease.

"This project will seek to create a more continuous, integrated workflow for cell therapy manufacturing based upon microfluidic technology and robotic cell processing. The transition to a more continuous cell therapy manufacturing workflow from the current batch processing can include a higher purity and yield of potent cells, which has also benefited other conventional manufacturing workstreams such as chemical manufacturing. With the cost of life-saving cell therapies >$100k per dose, innovating new integrated processes and technologies for cell therapy products is essential to expand access and increase the rate of innovation. There are several challenges to cell therapy manufacturing that this study will address. First, cell therapy products are currently produced using a “batch” manufacturing approach that consists of a multi-step process. As a result, the process results in batch-to-batch variation, an inability to use donor-specific variables in the manufacturing, and difficulty in system control of critical quality attributes. Second, the sensors that are used in cell therapy manufacturing that are related to cell function (e.g., molecular) are not real-time and cannot be used in nimble process control. Third, because autologous therapies are derived from a patient-donor, there is substantial variability of the starting material—yet this variability is not incorporated into the manufacturing process. The broader impacts of the project include the training of graduate and undergraduate students in microfluidic approaches to cell therapy manufacturing that may increase the innovation rate and decrease the costs associated with clinical cell manufacturing, while enabling small industry to innovate in the production of therapeutic cells.

This project will harness fluid dynamics at the microscale using integrated microfluidic transfection and separation operations, as well as vision- and data analytics-enabled robotics to help automate the cell culture process. As a testbed, the study will apply the technologies to an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived retinal organoid manufacturing process. The new technology and process control will be applied to generate functional retinal cell grafts, i.e., 3D engineered retinal constructs from iPSC-derived retinal organoids. The project can improve regenerative strategies through greater integration of iPSC genetic engineering, robotics-based culture, and new label-free cell selection methods to purify desired cell types that are consistent with Good Manufacturing Practices production. The team brings together three core expertises to accomplish the transformation: a current Good Manufacturing Practices process for retinal organoid manufacturing from human induced pluripotent stem cell culture; microfluidics-enabled cell transfection, characterization, and separation unit operations; and a capability for robotics-enabled cell processing and image analysis. The first objective is to apply a cell microfluidic transfection platform that uses choreographed mechanical deformations to convectively deliver large gene-editing CRISPR/Cas9 and DNA cargo to iPSCs. Moreover, because patient-derived specimens vary from donor to donor, the study will also characterize the biomechanical properties of donor cells to optimize the transfection. The second objective is to combine automated cell culture systems and machine learning to develop a robotic platform capable of performing high quality automated iPSC generation, CRISPR-correction, and retinal differentiation. The third objective examines how mixtures of retinal cells can better produce functional retinal grafts using a label-free cell separation microfluidic technology. Together the intellectual merits of this project will be to demonstrate an integrated approach to generate 3D engineered retinal constructs to address inherited blindness.

"This proposal will develop new microbrewery-like distributed manufacturing strategies for biomaterials containing messenger RNA or mRNA. There is a critical need for reliable manufacturing, storage, and distribution of mRNA-containing materials. For example, the current worldwide shortage of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 is caused not only by a need for a cold chain, but also by centralized manufacturing and distribution. Since mRNA is fragile, it often requires lipid nanoparticle protection and can only be preserved at ultralow temperatures. In this context, DNA origami, a self-assembly method that relies on oligonucleotide sequence complementarity, can be developed into thermally stable drug carriers with the potential to carry mRNA. In this project, the investigators will use yeast to produce large volumes of mRNA and oligo DNA sequences with accuracy and scalability. The resulting single-stranded DNA will self-assemble into origami nanostructures based on in silico designs, which will cage a targeted mRNA that is natively made with all needed chemical modifications. The DNA origami cage will allow for the purification and harvest of mRNA. The DNA architectures will be programmed for on-demand mRNA release and 3D printed into a hydrogel formulation for stable storage and administration. The proposed research will also be complemented by an educational and workforce development program. The proposed activities will develop hands-on and accompanied instruction-based learning contents to prepare the future workforce for biomanufacturing sectors. 

The central goal of the research is to create a transformative biomanufacturing platform, where organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae or S. cerevisiae are programmed to produce industrial-scale, custom-designed nucleic acids needed for DNA-caged mRNA biomaterials at decentralized locations. The research objectives include: (1) a mechanistic understanding of microbial processes to establish a scalable foundry for mRNA and oligonucleotide DNA; (2) the development of general principles for programmable  environmentally responsive DNA origami cages; (3) streamlined manufacturing processes where bioreactors and thermal cyclers are integrated with 3D printers for drug formulations; and (4) the efficacy of the manufactured mRNA-containing materials. The fundamental knowledge from the proposed study could transform two critical industries, nucleic acid synthesis and therapeutic biomaterials.

"This Research Advanced by Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering (RAISE) project will develop a dynamical model to enhance understanding of insect flight as an integrated system and apply this information to robotic design. Flight at the size of insects is very energetically challenging. Nonetheless, the evolution of flight spurred much of the evolutionary diversity of insects we see today. Insects fly long distances, maneuver in crowded and gusty environments, and overcome the energetic limitations of flapping wing flight in ways that cannot yet be matched in human-engineered systems. Insects couple springy exoskeletons to their wings to help store and return energy on every flap; however, to maximize energy return, insects would have to beat their wings at a steady rate. This project will explore how insects couple springs and wings together to manage energy requirements and flight control under a range of conditions. This project will also explore how the two distinct types of muscle contraction that insects use to power flight could both be achieved with the same underlying mechanics and muscle properties, enabling a mathematical framework for understanding how insects achieve such different types of flight. The project will use robophysical models with springy exoskeletons coupled to wings and insect-scale flapping robots to establish a general “spring-wing” framework. Research at both collaborating institutions will include an immersive, vertically integrated undergraduate research program. Student teams will receive mentorship and on-site research experience during the school year and will travel to their exchange location for interdisciplinary summer research. At least two graduate students and a post-doctoral fellow will also receive cross-disciplinary training.

Insect-scale flapping-wing flight demands both high-power actuation and low-latency control. To mitigate flight power requirements, most insects actuate their wings indirectly via muscles that deform a stiff, elastic exoskeleton. Coupling elastic elements to the wings allows insects potentially to operate as a resonant system, which would reduce power costs but also would introduce control constraints, such as limiting wingbeat frequency modulation. To power flapping flight, insects evolved two distinct actuation strategies: synchronous flight, with time-periodic forcing of antagonistic muscles paced by the nervous system, and asynchronous flight, in which muscles set up self-excited oscillations due to strain-dependent activation. The project will establish an analytic framework for spring-wing systems, test if insects operate at their hypothesized resonant frequencies, and develop a dynamically scaled robophysical spring-wing flapper to explore how a single non-dimensional parameter, the Weis-Fogh number, influences elastic energy storage and aerodynamic force control. The two muscle actuation strategies will then be combined, testing if synchronous flying insects that have evolved from asynchronous insects retain the necessary physiological signatures of self-excited (asynchronous) oscillations. A single dynamic system that can transition from the two regimes of stable flapping will be tested in the robophysical system and in an at-scale, bio-inspired flapping wing robot. Finally, the tradeoffs of operating at or away from resonance in spring-wing systems will be investigated. The project bridges the biological and physical sciences, will expand understanding of physiological and biomechanical principles and trade-offs involved in flight, and should transform the current understanding of insect flight, with applications to robotics. Undergraduate and graduate students and a post-doctoral fellow will participate in mentored, interdisciplinary research teams, and will present research results at national scientific meetings. Research results will also be disseminated through a bio-inspired design workshop.

"With the support of the Chemical Synthesis program in the Division of Chemistry, Heather R. Lucas and Katherine Belecki of Virginia Commonwealth University are synthesizing and studying a family of metal-containing compounds that can catalyze the conversion of target molecules into value-added products. Guided by Nature, this project uses knowledge gained from biological systems and bioinorganic model complexes to synthetically design potent and robust transition metal oxidants. These catalysts promote the principles of green chemistry by making use of earth-abundant metals (nickel or cobalt) held in a strategically designed organic scaffolds, and by performing oxidation reactions using natural oxidants like hydrogen peroxide or dioxygen. This project will focus on how a series of changes to the chemical structure of these designer catalysts can tune their reactivity, with an emphasis on advancing a molecular understanding of how these catalysts work. To accomplish these goals, catalyst variants will be synthesized and characterized, and their reactivity profiles will be evaluated. Select metallocomplexes will also be immobilized onto particles that are easily separated from reaction mixtures, enabling recovery and recycling of the designer catalysts and thus further advancing the green chemical principles that have, in part, inspired this work. This project will provide the basis for applications including the environmentally-friendly preparation of basic and fine chemicals or the catalytic degradation of persistent chemical contaminants. It also has the potential to generate fundamental knowledge that could inform the synthetic design of other bio-inspired oxidants. Students participating in this research will receive training not only in cutting-edge techniques but also in how to approach problem solving with a strategic and scientifically rigorous mentality. Moreover, concepts of bio-inspired catalysis and green chemistry are easily relatable to real-world phenomena, and thus will be used by the PI and the co-PI to pique the natural scientific curiosity of the broader community with a particular focus on inspiring the next generation of scientists through ongoing STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) outreach efforts with local youth.

With the support of the Chemical Synthesis program in the Division of Chemistry,  Heather R. Lucas and Katherine Belecki of Virginia Commonwealth University are pursuing the synthetic development, characterization, and application of electronic variations on a new class of hydrogen peroxide-activating transition-metal complexes that are strategically designed to employ transient metal-(di)oxygen adducts as green oxidants of organic molecules. This project will involve the synthesis of hybrid N4 macrocyclic ligand families containing both diamido and diamino donor atoms, the characterization and evaluation of their metallocomplexes as effective oxidation catalysts, and the immobilization of these catalysts for improved recyclability and expanded windows of operability enabled by flow chemistry. Substitutions on the aromatic ring of the N4 macrocyclic ligand scaffold will be assessed for their contributions to tuning the reactivity of the resulting metallocomplexes. Structural, electronic, and chemical characterization of the catalytic species for this series of electronic analogues will be achieved through a wide range of spectroscopic and analytical techniques. Advanced mechanistic studies will be pursued through reaction monitoring, isotopic labelling studies, kinetic profiling, and Hammett analyses. This catalyst family is active in oxygen atom transfer, hydrogen atom abstraction, and C-H activation reactions, all of which are broadly applicable in the synthesis of target molecules related to industrial (fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals) or academic (chemical biology probes, biomimetic model systems) applications. This project aims to deepen fundamental understanding of metal-(di)oxygen coordination complexes, the oxidative transformation reactions that they promote, and electron transfer considerations between ligands and metal centers of coordination complexes.  Successful completion of these studies will provide new perspectives for the synthetic design of bioinspired green oxidants. Moreover, harnessing metal catalysts that incorporate earth abundant metals through energy efficient reaction trajectories has the potential to contribute to the development of more economical and sustainable catalytic oxidation procedures.

"A significant challenge in treating some aggressive cancers and neurological diseases is the lack of understanding regarding the spatial-temporal molecular heterogeneity of the diseased tissue/organ. Molecular characteristics and interaction vary significantly across different spatial sub-units of the tissue/organ. The spatial pattern also changes over time as the disease progresses. The capability of mapping out the spatial-temporal patterns of molecular biomarkers is instrumental for elucidating the biological underpinning of disease formation, progression, and treatment resistance. This mapping, however, is extremely challenging, because it would require dense sampling of the diseased tissue/organ of a living person by highly invasive biopsy, which is infeasible. In reality, only a few samples can be taken, leaving a vast amount of unknown blank regions. On the other hand, recent years have witnessed the rapid advances of biomedical imaging technologies, which create structural and functional images of various modalities. Multimodality images can be taken non-invasively and for the entire diseased tissue/organ; importantly, they provide a complementary phenotypic presentation of underlying molecular characteristics. This creates an unprecedented opportunity to generate inverse-estimates of the underlying spatial-temporal molecular characteristics from the images to fill in the ""blank regions."" Once achieved, such inverse-estimates would help decipher the complex biological system of the diseased tissue/organ and inform new effective treatments with unparalleled precision adapted to spatial-temporal molecular heterogeneity.  

The objective of this project is to develop a suite of new statistical models for inverse mapping/estimation of the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of molecular biomarkers from multimodality image phenotype. The investigators propose a novel modeling framework that integrates data-driven and biological-principle-driven mechanistic models, and meanwhile fuses global-scale image data and sparsely-sampled local biopsy measurements. This framework embraces modeling approaches to characterize both spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of the disease. Furthermore, to account for patient similarity and specificity, the investigators propose a robust transfer learning model for integrating each patient?s data with information selectively transferred from other patients to avoid the negative transfer. Also, the project tackles joint modeling of a biomarker panel for characterizing spatial-temporal biomarker interaction. The proposed models will be validated in two applications: glioblastoma and Alzheimer's Disease. This project is expected to generate significant insight for unraveling the complex biological systems underlying these diseases and provide the groundwork for new treatment intervention. Additionally, the proposed modeling framework integrates statistical and bio-mechanistic models, which bridges two traditionally separate research fields together. The research team is committed to educating the next generation statisticians and biomedical researchers with cross-disciplinary skills, recruiting minority and women students, and disseminating research results in both statistical and bio/biomedical communities.

"Advances in agricultural practices have increased crop productivity in recent years but at the cost of soil quality. Soil and plant roots represent critical components in terrestrial carbon sequestration. The physics, chemistry and biology in this zone play central roles in global organic carbon, nitrogen and water cycles, and in a large part drive plant productivity. The opacity of soil coupled with the dynamic nature of the soil-root system have severely limited direct observations that would allow precise interventions as part of soil and plant management. New developments in subterranean exploration technology provide opportunities to probe the intricate relationship between roots and their surrounding soil environment. The investigators will integrate novel biologically inspired robotics; specifically soil endoscopes with fiber optics for soil and near root sensing and root growth and dynamics image capture, and novel soil sensing technology, for measurements of water and soil organic carbon dynamics. Developing this suite of novel tools will enable new means to interrogate the soil and specifically to address questions about roots, the “hidden half” of plants. This interdisciplinary effort has the potential to advance current belowground sensor systems across temporal and spatial scales to enable breeding efforts that directly affect food productivity and security. The project builds upon established programs that stimulate interest and engagement in science and engineering for girls, fosters public engagement in science and promotes training for early-career scientists.

The lack of a suitable technology to measure the interplay of roots, water, and carbon directly at the root-soil interface has severely limited the ability to elucidate the temporal and spatial variation in bulk versus rhizosphere soil processes including root-soil hydraulic contact, rhizosphere metabolite profiling and soil organic carbon forms for inclusion in plant breeding and crop management programs. This work has the potential to significantly unravel several scientific questions including: 1) understanding of how plant roots influence the biophysical environment of the rhizosphere, and 2) quantifying how root exudates alter water in the rhizosphere and key processes in soil organic matter formation. The investigators will use two new methods to navigate and sense roots and soils with minimal disturbance. These advances will allow spatio-temporal measurements of the near-root and bulk soil environment, an important yet overlooked component of agricultural systems where the amount of carbon stored belowground often surpasses aboveground storage. Moreover, integration of above – and belowground environmental data in maize field trials will allow for a detailed understanding of the interrelationship of plant phenotypes to soil properties.

"Although pandemics have threatened human civilization since ancient times, how to predict and prevent them remains one of the most pressing challenges, calling out for innovative insights and practices. Pandemics emerge through incidental ‘perfect storms’: molecular changes in pathogens, gradual trends in climate, subtle shifts in ecological interactions among potential hosts, and even individual behavioral decisions by people, all colluding to make up the difference between an interesting but rare new variant of a known disease and an existential worldwide crisis. Being able to predict the emergence of pandemic threats, therefore, requires a fully integrated, multidisciplinary approach, able to consider the complexity of these realms across scales of interaction to predict and, ideally, prevent. This workshop will include experts from otherwise disparate scholarly communities in biology, mathematics, engineering, computer science, ecology and social science to come together and discuss how to integrate the approaches taken by each community into a more effective, unified science of pandemic prediction. Discussions will leverage recently developed advances in disease ecology, computational biology and biophysics, information and network science, sensing, and statistics to analyze pertinent data, enabling inference of difficult-to-measure information and the integration of real-time observation, computation, and experimentation. 

The workshop aims at formulating a new science base on pandemic preparedness, identifying scientific gaps that need to be addressed, and discussing how to design solutions to fill those gaps in ways that anticipate multidisciplinary use. Participants will consider how to construct integrative and multidisciplinary frameworks to enable better insights into the fundamental processes of pandemic emergence and translate those insights into practical tools for preventing and/or mitigating pandemic threats. It is anticipated that the workshop will result into concrete recommendations for how the critical and diverse relevant fields can move forward together to increase global safety, guarding against future pandemics.

"As a fluid moves around a cylindrical or similarly shaped structure, the flow organizes into coherent vortices, which shed from alternate sides of the body producing a vibrational force. This vortex-induced-vibration is an undesirable consequence with far-reaching effects in engineering design, from long cylindrical mooring or transmission lines to structural supports of bridges, as well as many other applications susceptible to fluid flow. This project investigates potential methods to mitigate the unsteady vortex pattern and associated vibrational force by adding undulations along the cylinder. The specific geometry is inspired by the whiskers of seals which have shown that an alternating undulation pattern along the surface significantly reduces the vortex-induced-vibration under certain flow conditions. Of particular interest is how the wake behind the undulated structures can be modified and how it, in turn, would impact a system of closely packed structures. This has a variety of potential applications from hydrodynamic sensor arrays, the design of wind turbine farms, or the study of weather patterns over non-uniform forest canopies and mountainous terrain.  The educational components will include multiple undergraduate research projects and K-12 outreach programming integrated into existing dissemination mechanisms at University of Wisconsin-Madison and Portland State University.

This research explores the fundamental fluid mechanisms of flow over undulated cylinders and arrays of undulated cylinders inspired by the unique topography of seal whiskers. Causal links between the geometric features of the undulations, the resulting flow features, and the force and frequency response of the cylinder will be quantitatively identified by critical points and other key markers within the wake in terms of momentum and energy transfer. Building upon the single-cylinder data, a framework for wake-wake and wake-structure interactions will be developed and tested for small and large array configurations. Both simulations and wind tunnel experiments will be utilized in a complementary and collaborative research plan that spans a large range of flow conditions and configurations. This will be accomplished through particle-image-velocimetry for detailed wake measurements as well as direct numerical simulation and large-eddy simulations for time-resolved forces and quantification of mechanisms in the near-wake region.

"Biological, chemical, and physical processes in industries such as healthcare, electronics, and energy production require controlled environments, sometimes with extreme conditions. For example, organ transplants need to be stored at ultralow temperatures. Fuel cells used for power generation often operate at very high temperatures, with specialized gases. The design of advanced materials and systems across many industries requires a better understanding of the biological and chemical processes involved. This demands testing environments that closely mimic real process conditions, which is an enormous challenge. The acquisition of a confocal Raman microscope with sophisticated environmental control will enable in vivo chemical mapping under a wide temperature range and different gas/liquid environments. This instrument will facilitate cutting-edge research and education projects across four research areas-nanomaterials, bioengineering, thermal and chemical engineering, and collaboration among three institutions-Villanova University, Bryn Mawr College, and Cabrini University. Moreover, the instrument will support a range of integrated research and education projects and provide opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. This facility will also be integrated into three K-12 outreach activities with an expected enrollment of over 500 under-represented students. 

With a temperature range of -196 to about 1000°C and controlled gas/liquid environments, the confocal Raman microscope can provide high resolution and real-time structural and chemical fingerprints of materials and chemicals. Raman spectroscopy has a unique compatibility with aqueous or high temperature, particularly suited for biological and high temperature characterizations. Seven projects will be enabled at three institutions. They include investigations on solid oxide fuel cells to provide important insight into fuel reaction mechanisms, two dimensional materials to promote new synthetic methods and understanding of their structure-property relations under extreme conditions, energy storage materials for high-performance energy storage systems, spin-phonon coupling in multiferroic oxides to provide unprecedented evidence for the mechanism of multiferroicity, molecular mechanisms of cryo-injury for developing cell preservation technologies, molecular properties of intact drosophila hearts to provide insights on physiological aging. By addressing all these needs, the proposed instrument will greatly advance knowledge and promote interdisciplinary research in nanomaterials, thermal and chemical engineering, and bioengineering/biology.

"Cardiotoxicity represents a major segment of drug toxicities, so there are considerable concerns about the cardiovascular safety profile of drugs used for non-cardiovascular medication. Conventional drug screening approaches, such as using a 2-dimensional cell culture and animal models, have notable limitations. Approaches are needed to fabricate cardiac tissue models that more reliably reproduce human physiology with respect to their structure and function. For cardiotoxicity assays it is equally important to monitor the behavior of the model tissue in response to drugs, ideally in a label-free and non-invasive manner. The goal of this research project is to develop an engineered cardiac tissue model for cardiotoxicity screening that will facilitate drug screening and personalized medicine. The design of the 3-dimensional model involves cardiac tissues that are embedded with soft and stretchable microelectronics that can continuously measure cardiotoxicity within the tissue. The outcomes of this project could lead to significant cost reductions for drug development by accurately predicting human responses to drug candidates. The research also could help reduce the use of animal models for drug screening. The project will provide opportunities to promote STEM education for K-12 students, especially those from under-represented groups, and to disseminate science and engineering knowledge to the public.

This research project aims to develop a multi-material, stereolithographically-bioprinted cardiac tissue model with embedded soft and stretchable microelectronics. The main research idea is that seamless integration of mechanically matched soft microelectronics and bioprinted cardiac models will allow for continuous, in situ and intra-tissue measurements of cardiotoxicity in real time and in response to pharmaceutical compounds. The project participants will conduct experimental and analytical studies to design, optimize, fabricate, characterize and validate the hybridized cardiac tissue model. Specific steps include 1) optimizing the design and fabrication of the engineered microvascularized cardiac tissue model to achieve structural and functional similarity to its in vivo counterpart, 2) designing, analyzing, fabricating, and testing soft, stretchable microelectronics, 3) integrating the soft microelectronics with the bioprinted cardiac tissue to form hybridized cardiac tissue model, and 4) studying the screening of a panel of drugs with induced electrophysiological and mechanical beating signals from the intra-tissue microelectronics.

"Insects and other animals harbor intestinal microbial communities (or ‘gut microbiota’) that play important roles in their biology. However, the processes underlying how these communities assemble in the gut remain largely unexplored. In this collaborative project between researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (US) and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (UK), advanced molecular techniques and experimental approaches will be used to identify the genetic factors contributing to gut microbiota assembly in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, an insect of significant interest because adult females can transmit Zika, dengue, and other arboviruses that cause severe disease in humans. Results from this work will therefore significantly enhance our understanding of mosquito biology with applied relevance to disease transmission in humans and other vertebrates. Results will also expand fundamental knowledge of how animal hosts control gut colonization by bacteria and, conversely, how bacteria adapt to the gut to form stable associations with their animal hosts. Broader impacts of this project to society include the scientific training of postdoctoral researchers and students at the graduate and undergraduate levels to become the next generation of STEM leaders. Educational programming will also be developed for use by the general public and students at the middle, high school, and undergraduate levels. This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.

This project seeks a mechanistic understanding of host-microbiota interactions during gut microbiome assembly. To date, co-evolution has been investigated largely in bacterial partners of highly stable, long-term associations such as obligate human pathogens. The central hypothesis of this project is that host-microbiota co-adaptation can also occur over repeated interactions spanning very short time scales and is mediated by genetic factors of both hosts and bacteria. Three specific aims will address this hypothesis in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, which harbors simple gut bacterial communities that can be experimentally manipulated. Both A. aegypti and its associated gut bacteria are also genetically tractable. In Aim 1, transcriptome sequencing and functional studies in mosquitoes colonized by defined microbiomes of varying genetic complexity will identify mosquito genes and pathways that control microbiome acquisition and homeostasis. In Aim 2, experimental evolution and transcriptome sequencing of bacteria during gut colonization will identify how bacteria adapt to the mosquito gut environment and establish mixed communities. Finally, studies in Aim 3 will establish whether and to what extent observed host-microbiota interactions are conserved across different host mosquito species. Results will improve understanding of host-microbiota gene interactions during gut colonization and provide valuable long-term genomic and transcriptomic resources to the broader scientific community. This research will also be integrated with education and outreach through the training of postdoctoral and graduate researchers and the development of an undergraduate capstone research project and citizen science toolkit. Results will further be shared through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentation at scientific meetings.

"Locusts are grasshoppers that can form enormous migrating swarms, once vividly recorded in ancient texts, but still occurring to this day and affecting the livelihood of one in ten people on Earth. Currently, multiple continents are experiencing locust plagues that threaten food security both locally and on a larger, potentially global, scale. What makes locusts particularly devastating is their ability to change their behavior depending on population density – this is known as locust phase polyphenism. At low density, they are solitary and harmless grasshoppers, but at high density, they become gregarious and voracious pests that migrate. This plasticity, or variation, in behavior, appearance, and physiology is striking and how population density facilitates this change is still not fully understood. Studying the mechanism of this transformation holds the key to developing effective methods of control for this organism, ensuring food safety, and understanding how social/population pressures can fuel radical change in these animals.  This undertaking will require comprehensive scientific integration across different biological disciplines to be accomplished. To address this challenge, a group of researchers has formed a cross-institutional, cross-disciplinary Biological Integration Institute – the Behavioral Plasticity Research Institute (BPRI). Using cutting-edge technologies in research projects spanning from molecules to landscapes, the BPRI will greatly enhance our understanding of locust phase polyphenism and plasticity in other organisms. With a commitment to improving diversity, inclusion and equity, the institute will train the next generation of integrative biologists who can efficiently navigate across different disciplines. The institute will communicate groundbreaking research to the general public and the scientific community through video documentaries, symposia and workshops. The BPRI will partner with the Global Locust Initiative to translate the scientific advances to management for improving global food system sustainability.
 

Phenotypic plasticity – the ability of a single genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to different environmental conditions – is ubiquitous in nature and occurs across all scales of biological organization. To understand its mechanisms, maintenance, and evolution, complete biological integration is needed. Locust phase polyphenism represents one of the most striking examples of phenotypic plasticity. It also provides a powerful comparative system for understanding how gene expression patterns and epigenetic regulation are linked to shifts in behavior, physiology, and ecology that result in outbreaks, collective movement, and mass migration. The Behavioral Plasticity Research Institute (BPRI) will comprehensively dissect this phenomenon and use it as a model system to transform the study of phenotypic plasticity. Specifically, the BPRI will carry out ten integrative research activities, using three locust and three non-swarming grasshopper species with varying degrees of plasticity in the genus Schistocerca. The BPRI research will provide in-depth understanding of proximate mechanisms of locust phase polyphenism by generating high-quality reference genomes, complemented by tissue-specific and time-resolved transcriptomes and epigenomes, as well as CRISPR/Cas9 and reverse genetics tools to understand functional genetics. These mechanistic approaches will be integrated with organismal biology and ecology to investigate phase-associated nutritional physiology and ecological factors contributing to swarming under laboratory and field conditions. All research activities will be performed across species in a phylogeny-based comparative framework. The feedback among these activities will create synergies and lay the groundwork for the integrative study of phenotypic plasticity across model organisms from genomes to ecology and sustainability.

"Microbes can create fuels and chemicals from biomass. Bio-based fuels help contribute to energy security in the US. One current limitation to using microbes for production is that the microbes also use the same biomass to grow. Rapid growth reduces fuel and chemical production.  However, new strategies for controlling the microbial metabolism could separate growth from product formation. The objective of this project is to develop a modular control system to be applied across many different organisms. Success of this project will enhance microbial production of fuels and chemicals, thus advance the bioeconomy.  
 
The objective of this project is to evaluate a novel strategy for dynamic metabolic control. We will use advanced computational protein design and engineering to remodel T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP), which transcribes DNA into mRNA, such that it requires a user-defined small molecule to function. This remodeled polymerase would be constitutively expressed. This induction molecule activates the polymerase, resulting in expression of T7-specific genes. We will (i) identify inexpensive chemicals that are non-toxic and non-metabolizable for diverse non-model host organisms; (ii) deploy dynamically controlled circuits in Pseudomonas putida for production of muconate to show improved metrics of titer/yield/productivity; and (iii) demonstrate the utility of T7 RNAP circuits for other biomanufacturing-relevant organisms.

"Microbial communities populate nearly all environments on our planet. These environments  include the human gut, the surface of corals in the oceans, and plant roots in the soil. In these communities, bacteria interact with each other to sustain environmental health. Understanding these interactions will reveal factors that establish robust, productive communities.  This project will focus on bacteria isolated from hot spring mats of Yellowstone National Park. A deeper understanding of the physical and metabolic conversations among bacteria that thrive in this extreme environment will be gained and used to model these interactions. New courses on microbial consortia will be developed and shared by all participating Universities. The PIs will also develop programs in partnership with local science museums and TV stations to encourage science literacy and community involvement. 
 
This project is focused on extremophile bacteria isolated from the hot spring mats of Yellowstone National Park. The approach will be to query the entire bacterial community within the mat as well as synthetic combinations of the bacteria grown under defined conditions in the laboratory. The application of sequencing and metabolomic technologies will reveal key metabolic pathways among members of the community under different light and nutrient conditions and over the diel cycle. The work will evaluate the hypothesis that microbial communities act like an integrated machine rather than as individual species grown under axenic conditions in the laboratory, and that this integration maintains functionalities critical for life in natural habitats. Experiments will also be performed to analyze how abrupt changes in light intensity, temperature and microbial composition impact mat growth, structure, electrical and metabolic networks.

"Microbial pathogen transmission in buildings is an urgent public health concern. The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) adds to the urgency of developing effective means to reduce pathogen transmission in public buildings with minimal disruptions in building functions. With the ultimate goal to develop healthy buildings that minimize risks of infectious diseases, this project will develop smart control strategies for buildings and assistive robots to mitigate pathogen transmission and occupant exposure. New techniques will be developed to monitor and predict pathogen spreading, automate building ventilation, enable intelligent recognition of contaminated objects, and perform precision disinfection to reduce pathogen transmission through air circulation and surface contacts. Findings from this project will also guide occupants and facility managers to develop and implement effective behavioral interventions and hygiene practices. If successful, this research will revolutionize the control of built environments to enable protection against infectious diseases, which will have vast public health and economic benefits to the nation. This project will also create new and unique opportunities to stimulate the academic interests of students and support the development of next-generation workforce adequately equipped with interdisciplinary computing and engineering skills needed to address challenges facing the nation.

The objectives of this research are: 1) Advance understanding of linkages among physical, biological, and social processes that drive the dynamics of human-pathogen interactions in building environments; and 2) Develop a novel cyber-physical system of integrated monitoring, building control, robot adaptation, and human-in-the-loop interactions to reduce the transmission of infectious pathogens. This research pioneers a novel digital-twinning approach that integrates building information modeling, privacy-preserving internet of things sensing, spatiotemporal molecular and metagenomic sequencing, and machine learning to map building-human-pathogen interactions for predicting contamination and infection risks at multiple spatiotemporal scales. New methods will be developed to connect and manage the buildings, occupants, and robots to reduce pathogen burdens. These methods include: model-based and dynamic-data-enabled optimal control of building ventilation; learning algorithms for robotic identification of contaminated spots; adaptive disinfection processes with behavioral considerations; and co-optimization of building operations and robotic disinfection with real-time sensing. In addition, user-centric systems will be developed to analyze contextual information and recommend hygiene practices, organizational operations, and crowd management to prevent disease spreading and maintain functionalities within buildings.

"Nanoscale interactions determine nanoparticle safety and effectiveness in environmental, biological, and medical applications. To better exploit the potential of nanoparticles for these applications, a fundamental understanding of nanoscale interactions is required. This project will provide a quantitative understanding of nanoscale interactions at single particle and single cell levels by systematically studying inter-nanoparticle interactions, nanoparticle-cell interactions, and nanoparticle intracellular transport using unique bio-analytical methods. The potential scientific impact of this project will be in providing engineering guidelines for the design of safer and more effective nanoparticles made possible by a deeper quantitative understanding, and thus better control, of nanoscale interactions. Core educational impacts are based on bionanotechnology engagement of Native American and other underserved high school juniors in rural Southwest Oklahoma via year-round research-integrated education and outreach activities to inspire successful careers in science and engineering.

The safe and effective use of nanoparticles in environmental, biological, and medical applications requires a better quantitative understanding of nanoparticle interactions with biological media and systems. This project will establish a new research paradigm to systematically study the mechanisms and kinetics of nanoscale interactions based on unique label-free and in situ quantitative bio-analytical methods at single particle and single cell levels via three research objectives. In Objective 1, inter-nanoparticle interactions will be quantified. Nanoparticle-cell interactions will be assessed in Objective 2. In Objective 3, nanoparticle intracellular transport will be determined with unique spatiotemporal resolution. These quantitative and mechanistic studies have the potential to inform the engineering of nanoparticles that efficiently overcome biological barriers for safe and effective biological and medical applications. This research will additionally enable a better quantitative and mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle environmental interactions and associated ecological effects. The scientific vision will be integrated with the engagement of Native American and other underserved high school juniors in bionanotechnology via a unique program termed Bionanotechnology Engagement for Native Americans in Oklahoma (BE4NANO). In partnership with local Native American tribes, public high schools, a technology center, and university allies, there will be two primary educational objectives to (i) engage these students in bionanotechnology via year-round activities, and to (ii) create academic and social support networks for these students within the institution. Through BE4NANO, high school students will be inspired to consider careers as scientists and engineers. In addition, the PI will provide support and encouragement to maximize success, thereby increasing the number of Native American students in college science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs and retaining these students in their programs of study. Students will be empowered to engage and inspire the next generation of BE4NANO participants within their underserved communities, creating a positive and inclusive feedback loop to sustain this holistic research-integrated education and outreach program.

This project is jointly funded by the Nanoscale Interactions Program within the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) Division and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve clinical outcomes and quality-of-life for pancreatic cancer patients. Only 10% of pancreatic cancer survive five years after diagnosis because most cases are detected at later stages when clinical interventions are relatively ineffective. Earlier detection improves interventions, prevents unnecessary procedures arising from uncertain diagnosis, and leads to health system cost savings. Roughly 5 million individuals in the US are at higher risk, but there is no screening test available today for earlier stages, a surveillance market estimated at $3 B. This project will develop a diagnostic test for surveillance of people at high risk for developing pancreatic cancer, with methods potentially applicable to other types of cancer and other diseases.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a technology using a small blood sample to detect the functional state of multiple biological signaling pathways known to participate in cancer inception and progression. This technology can analyze these low abundance proteins at a low cost suitable for a widely adopted surveillance test.  A purpose-built bioinformatic system analyses and compares the bio-signature identified by the assay across many individuals.  This Phase II project will optimize the panel of protein targets in the assay to detect high-performing differential bio-signatures for early stages of the disease, and it will enhance the machine-learning-based matching methodology.

"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has for the last century been fundamental to the study of genetics. It is used in many areas of research as the model organism of choice, as it provides the ability to study genetics in the laboratory and apply findings to human genetics. Its use as a model is due to two factors: First, its genetic code can be relatively easily manipulated in the laboratory and this coupled with a short life cycle, provides a means by which a gene or pathway function can be rapidly studied. Secondly, the vast majority of the fundamental biochemical mechanisms and pathways are conserved between fly and humans. Indeed, 75% of the genes that cause human disease are found in fly and, thus, the data collected in the fly can be used to provide insights into the same processes within humans. The emergence of a new technology, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), has provided information as to which genes are switched on or most active from a single cell. Within the fly community this provides the ability to quickly map clusters of cells and cell types to the whole anatomy and link this to both phenotype and function. The increasing number of scRNA-seq datasets from different species has resulted in the development of the Single Cell Expression Atlas (scEA). This is a web portal which enables users to more easily visualize and interpret this data. It is anticipated that the level of fly single cell data will increase from 10 datasets to ~100 in 2020 and further two-fold increase in 2021. Key to the scientific exploitation of this data will be the ability of users to not only effectively analyze the fly data but also to examine the interconnections between fly data and human or mouse datasets. 

This project will provide the means by which fly datasets can be easily interpreted and also linked to mouse and human datasets via scEA. The scEA currently hosts scRNA-seq data for over 500K assays and this includes data for the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) and Mouse Cell Atlas (MCA), amongst others. Analysis pipelines will be developed to combine the available and emerging datasets, alongside the necessary computational infrastructure to host the Fly Cell Atlas (FCA) datasets. ScEA will provide users with an easy to navigate web service with exploratory querying capability, in addition to data download capabilities for further data analysis. The service will be fully integrated with the established fly resources, Flybase, Virtual Fly Brain and the Drosophila Resources at Harvard University. This project will also develop a process for annotation of the datasets. This annotation step adds additional scientific information to the data which provides the user with a greater level of biological understanding and so aids the interpretation and analysis. This annotation will expand on the existing FlyBase anatomy ontology which is a structure of controlled vocabularies used to describe the anatomy of the fly this will ensure that there is full compatibility across new and existing resources. The scEA will develop and provide the means by which the data can be easily visualized and mined for cell types, while also providing the fly community with the ability to contribute their scientific expertise to the annotation. The scEA user interface will be further developed to provide a greater level of cross species query ability as the resulting FCA will be linked within scEA to the HCA, MCA and any further datasets enabling cross species comparisons which will aid in the discovery of novel biological insights. This project aims to provide the fly community with practical solutions for connecting, re-using and reanalyzing datasets and so will close the gap in translating biological discoveries in model organisms, such as the fruit fly, to humans and vice versa. This project will make the results of this comparative analysis rapidly available to the growing user community.

"The NSF Engineering Research Centers Unite project aims to develop and test a comprehensive set of instruments designed to enhance the evaluation of education and diversity programs offered by NSF-funded Engineering Research Centers (ERC). ERC education and diversity programming, including academic year activities with undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars plus summer programs for undergraduate students, high school students, K-12 teachers, and community college instructors, is a mechanism to disseminate emerging knowledge from center activities. It is critically important that programs offered by these large, multi-institutional centers be evaluated for effectiveness to ensure their impact beyond ERC technical research. The resulting suite of instruments supplemented by an evaluator toolbox will fill an existing void and allow centers to collaborate in ways previously not possible. This will enhance our understanding of ERCs and their overall impact on skill development, climate of inclusion, and future STEM workforce development.

This project is led by the Arizona State University Tri-ERC Education Consortium (TEEC), which consists of education leaders, researchers, and evaluators associated with three currently funded ERCs - Center for Bio-mediated and Bio-inspired Geotechnics (CBBG), Nanosystems Center for Nano-Enabled Water Treatment (NEWT), and Center for Quantum Energy and Sustainable Solar Technologies (QESST). The goals to be undertaken by this team include: 1) identifying the evaluation needs of currently funded ERCs, 2) creating a suite of evaluation instruments, 3) creating an evaluator toolbox, and 4) making our resources broadly available. We will create quantitative (e.g. survey) and qualitative (e.g., interview, focus group, and lab observation protocols) measures informed by the needs and perspectives of current ERCs. These instruments will be field-tested across TEEC ERCs and other participating ERCs who have indicated an interest in using the suite of instruments. These instruments will be accompanied by an evaluator toolbox designed to support and guide evaluators in the use of these instruments. These resources will doubly serve as a means of creating an ERC community of practice around evaluation. The resulting resources will be made broadly available electronically through currently used ERC websites/hubs. Additionally, the quantitative Multi-ERC Instrument (MERCI) will be converted into an online ERC Evaluation System easily accessed by evaluators. The proposed system will specifically streamline quantitative evaluation, which will provide for greater flexibility and creativity in the selection of qualitative evaluation approaches used by center evaluators. The adoption of these shared resources by numerous ERCs will open up never before seen opportunities for cross-ERC comparisons. The findings will significantly impact how ERCs evaluate their education and diversity programming and presents a potential suite of instruments for effectively evaluating any large center that offers similar education and diversity programs.

"The Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation (QCM-D) is a highly sensitive balance that can detect changes in mass at the molecular level by monitoring changes in frequency and dissipation of a quartz crystal.  These capabilities significantly enhance material development research of surfaces and interfaces over a wide range of areas, such as coating development; fouling of membranes; drug capsule preparations; and bio-absorption of aqueous media on geological formations.  This instrument will be used as a shared facility in the State of Mississippi and the southeastern region, coordinated by investigators from the University of Mississippi (UM) and Mississippi State University (MSU).  Specifically, this instrument will be used to dramatically improve research productivity from at least eight Departments across two Universities (UM and MSU), spanning Chemical, Biomedical, Civil, and Agricultural / Biological Engineering; Department of Geosciences; and the School of Pharmacy.  Fourteen different research groups will immediately benefit from incorporation of this instrument into their research activities, and up to 65 research students will learn new interfacial measurements using this state-of-the-art equipment.  Additionally, over 200 students will be positively impacted by the study of academic courses that will utilize the QCM-D for practical activities, with approximately half of these students being from underrepresented groups.  Finally, this instrument will also be used for summer research activities to interest K-12 students in STEM, as part of a dedicated outreach program.

The QCM-D is a state-of-the-art instrument used in material development and investigation of surfaces and interfaces.  It has molecular-level accuracy in measuring adsorption, binding, or removal of molecules from a surface.  The proposed instrument has several modules besides the basic 4-channel flow module, including a constant humidity chamber; a module to conduct concurrent microscopy measurements; a high temperature chamber to 150oC; and a spin coater to prepare individual sensors with unique surfaces.  This infrastructure will initially serve 14 research groups in areas of a) multifunctional coating development for packaging applications; b) ionic liquid / polymer composites for membrane separations; c) coating development for drug delivery; d) cell division and muscle contraction; e) graphene-based nanocarriers for drug delivery; f) mineralization mechanisms at nano and micro scales in geological applications; and g) bio-absorption of aqueous media on geological formations.  These efforts will be expanded to other areas with the shared nature intended for this instrument with other institutions and industries.

"With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Alexander Angerhofer from the University of Florida to investigate the degradation of oxalic acid by an enzyme known as oxalate decarboxylase which is found in soil bacteria and fungi. Overloading the body with oxalic acid can lead to kidney stones and other adverse health effects in animals and humans. As a plant product oxalic acid is present in many plant-derived foods in appreciable quantities. A way to keep the amount of oxalic acid low is to decompose it by chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes.  The research of Dr. Angerhofer is focused on the elucidation of the mechanism by which the enzyme oxalate decarboxylase breaks down oxalic acid. More specifically, Dr. Angerhofer will test the hypothesis that to decompose oxalic acid, this protein transfers electrons over a long distance, about 2 nm, between two manganese ions, one of which is located at the active site for the chemical transformation of oxalic acid.  This study will involve use of a combination of advanced biochemical methods of protein engineering with structural and spectroscopic methods, including X-ray crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance, and optical spectroscopy. The results of this research will enhance our fundamental knowledge of reactions that involve bio-active manganese and will ultimately aid in devising strategies to mitigate the presence of oxalic acid in plants. The project supports the training of a growing and diverse science and technology workforce in the state of Florida by involving students in research that helps them acquire scientific and professional skills useful in the bio-economy of the 21st century. The training of undergraduate students is supported through a course-based undergraduate research experience at the University of Florida and through the University Research Scholars Program, which brings gifted freshmen students to the cutting edge of modern research.

This award supports the research of Dr. Angerhofer focused on the study of the molecular mechanisms by which the bacterial enzyme oxalate decarboxylase catalyzes the cleavage of the kinetically inert carbon-carbon bond in oxalic acid. It has been proposed that long-range electron transfer between the manganese ions situated at the N- and the C-terminal ends of the proteins subunits plays an important catalytic role.   X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, electrochemistry, and an array of advanced electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technologies, in combination with site-directed mutagenesis will be applied to the problem. The activity of manganese ions in the protein and a chain of electron transfer-active amino acids will be studied. Genetic code expansion methods will be used to introduce unnatural amino acids into the enzyme at specific target sites where they can be used to probe a long-range electron transfer pathway that may exist in the quaternary structure of the enzyme. The planned experiments will yield important structural and kinetic information about substrate and oxygen co-factor binding to the enzyme.  The hypothesis that will be tested is that via long-range electron transfer dioxygen promotes catalysis by generating the +3 oxidation state on the active-site Mn ion situated at the N-terminal end, which in turn drives the reaction. The proposed work will elucidate how proteins tune and utilize the redox potential of mono-nuclear Mn centers for catalysis.

"With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Michael Pluth from the University of Oregon to investigate biologically-relevant reactive sulfur and selenium compounds. These compounds play important roles in biological systems, but in many cases the underlying chemistry and reactivity of these compounds that supports their biological function remains unclear. Dr. Pluth investigates this complex chemistry using relatively simple sulfur-containing model compounds synthesized for this purpose in his laboratory. In addition, the proposed experiments probe differences and similarities between the reactivity of the new sulfur compounds and related, selenium compounds. The research is implemented by graduate and undergraduate students who gain knowledge and skills of bioorganic and bioinorganic chemistry useful in STEM careers in the 21st century. An educational broader impact focuses on the design of hands-on laboratory-based experiments for middle school students and on raising the awareness of the students of the importance of negative experimental results in guiding the design of future areas of scientific investigation.

This research project investigates the fundamental chemistry associated with the storage, signaling, and action of reactive sulfur and selenium species relevant to biological system. Specifically, the work probes the chemical mechanisms that differentiate persulfide signaling and hydrogen sulfide release and expands studies on the bioavailability of uninvestigated sulfane sulfur sources. Building on connections to related reactive selenium species, small molecules that allow the modulation of biological hydrogen selenide pools are being developed. Information gained from these investigations is expected to shed light on the connections and interactions among reactive sulfur and selenium species across a range of oxidation states in biological systems.  In the longer term, the tools developed in these studies have the potential to help elucidate some of the key roles that the small molecule reduced chalcogenides, H2S (hydrogen sulfide) and H2Se (hydrogen selenide)and their oxidized counterparts play in biological communication and signaling.

"<p>This project promotes fair and ethical treatment of veterans in the future job landscape by providing the empirical knowledge needed to remove implicit bias and misconceptions against veterans and prepare veterans for obtaining and maintaining competitive positions in the future workforce. Despite their strong work ethic and dedication, many veterans in the U.S still face major barriers to participating in the civilian workforce. After separation from duty, service members often participate in a week-long transition assistance program that, at best, can be described as a convenient ""one-size-fits-all"" solution. Research studying the limitations of the veteran population in entering this dynamically changing job market is scarce and does not provide a full understanding of the challenges faced by the veteran population as well as their train of thought during the time of the job interview. This project gathers empirical evidence to understand veterans' common feelings, thoughts, and potential weaknesses in social effectiveness skills during the civilian job interviews. The project further provides a preliminary assistive technology enabled by artificial intelligence for promoting veterans' interview skills in a tailored and inclusive manner, ultimately preparing them for the future workforce and broadening their participation in fields where they are traditionally underrepresented, such as computing. In addition to interview training, through effective partnerships with industry, this work creates educational materials for promoting unexplored strengths of the veteran population, such as commitment, reliability, and sense of duty, to the potential employers, thereby changing the job hiring culture and providing veterans with more opportunities in the future job landscape.</p>

<p>This project explores the above goals through a collaboration between computational and behavioral sciences for acquiring new insights into veterans' experiences during civilian interviews and designing novel technologies for supporting veterans in this task. The research work will be carried out with three technical aims. The first aim is on data collection through focus group discussions and real-life interviews of veterans with industry representatives to identify challenging encounters during the interview. Data include behavioral reactions, physiological reactivity, and subjective assessments of both the interviewer and interviewee, which are examined in association with the interview setting and are further triangulated. The second aim will explore quantifiable measures of interviewees' moment-to-moment stress based on their vocalizations, visual expressions, and physiological reactivity. These quantifiable measures are employed for the preliminary design of training interventions that can assist veterans on coping with stress during the job interview training. The third aim will examine the interviewee's ability to engage with the interviewer. In particular, the researchers will develop new methods in natural language processing and affective computing for detecting overly formal conversational language specific to the military, as well as degradation in social aspects of the interaction from acoustic and visual cues.</p>

"Advances in cell-based bioproduction (within engineered or synthetic cells) promises to solve global challenges such as production of fuel, food, cosmetics, and drugs in a sustainable manner. Scaling-up cellular bioproduction is however limited by the burdens this can cause to the host cell. This research will develop tunable, low-burden RNA molecules for control of gene expression of useful molecules. Experiments will be supported by computational models, to understand the dynamics of cellular burden and to optimize bioproduction performance. This project, which is a collaboration between researchers at the University of California-Los Angeles (US) and Imperial College London (UK), will provide training and mentorship to several graduate and undergraduate students. Results and methods will be shared with the scientific community via publications, archival documents, and data repositories; the Principal Investigators will also share their work within the World Economic Forum Expert Network and the Engineering Biology Research Consortium. This research will be integrated both in graduate courses and in the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Synthetic Biology summer course. Dr. Franco will deliver outreach talks at underserved schools in California’s Inland Empire as well as at international conferences supported by the IEEE Controls Systems Society. 

Synthetic biology has made it possible to repurpose cells to operate as microscale factories, energy sources, and even computers. However, the introduction of pathways that are poorly tunable and non-native to the host often causes undesired cross-interactions and unpredictable responses, and reliable engineering of cells remains a challenge. In particular, the introduction of exogenous pathways depletes cellular resources of the host, triggering physiological changes, lower growth, and poor circuit performance, a set of phenomena collectively known as cellular burden. This research will address the challenges related to robust circuit engineering and burden mitigation by developing synthetic RNA-based regulators, a programmable platform that imposes a low burden on the host. The project will focus on systematic screening and tuning of the response function of two classes of RNA regulators, which will then be used to characterize the kinetics of the cellular burden response, whose onset and recovery speed have not been elucidated. An improved knowledge of burden kinetics will enable the generation of robust RNA-based feedback loops to manage bioproduction of mevalonic-acid in E. coli. At every stage, experiments will be supported and guided by mathematical modeling and feedback control design principles.

"Although invisible to the human eye, microorganisms have immense impact on society and the environment. They keep soil healthy, cause disease, and give us tools like antibiotics to fight the diseases other microbes cause. Accurate and precise identification of microbes is thus essential for understanding microbiology in general, for diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and for maintaining a healthy society and a healthy environment. The DNA sequencing revolution allows us to read the genetic code of individual microbes, and use this for fast and accurate identification. However, we cannot do this without reference databases that precisely define classes of microorganisms, and associate them with their unique characteristics. We also need fast computer programs that can handle the large amounts of data involved and, to be most useful to the world, we need to allow anyone, anywhere to upload the genetic data for the microbes they find, and quickly get an accurate identification of their likely impact. Therefore, scientists will build genomeRxiv, a Web site and a database of hundreds of thousands of accurately catalogued and classified public genome sequences of bacteria and archaea. Building on existing work, a combination of fast and accurate algorithms will be employed for users to query the database. A unique feature will keep submitted genomes private, which will enable and stimulate networking and facilitate sharing of genome sequencing results among scientists across academia, industry, and government, leading to a more efficient, and economically stimulating, use of research funds. Automated design of diagnostic tools will facilitate detection and regulation of pathogens for biosafety and biosecurity and directly impact clinical and veterinary medicine, plant pathology, and the use of beneficial microbes in agriculture. The scientific community will be trained in the use of genomeRxiv, and undergraduate and graduate students of diverse backgrounds will receive education at the interface of biology and computer science.

The number of sequenced genomes is increasing exponentially, but automated assignment of taxonomic identity is constrained by transfer of existing taxonomy. Up to ≈20% of the existing classifications are expected to be incorrect, and determined by historically contingent polyphasic tests that do not correspond to meaningful phylogenomic groupings identifiable at genome level. The continued incorrect and inaccurate assignment of taxonomic identities undermines our understanding of prokaryote evolution and diversity, as well as legislative efforts to regulate and monitor pathogens, which are reliant on accurate identification. Tools already developed by the PIs of this project will be improved and integrated into a new computational service called genomeRxiv, which aims to solve these problems. The existing LINbase Web server will serve as the basis for the new genomeRxiv service. The highly resolved Life Identification NumberTM (LINTM) classification framework of PIs Vinatzer and Heath will be combined with the speed and computational efficiency of the sourmash software developed by PI Brown and the precision and filtering ability of the pyani software developed by PI Pritchard.

"Cells are the fundamental units that provide functions needed to sustain life in living organisms. Cellular functions are carried out by proteins, products of genes, and the process of producing proteins from genes (i.e., gene expression) is mediated by complex regulation systems. Much remains unknown about the mechanisms of gene regulations. Given all genes in a cell, the regulatory relationships among genes can be represented by networks, called gene regulatory networks. It has been a long-standing challenge to reconstruct these networks experimentally and computationally. A gene can express multiple isoforms (mRNA molecules), and hence produces multiple different proteins, which makes the underlying gene regulatory networks more complicated. Recent advances in single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technology has brought new opportunities in resolving high-quality regulatory networks, but also posed new computational challenges. The project aims to computationally reconstruct accurate regulatory networks at the isoform-level from large-scale sequencing data.  Educational and outreach activities, such as courses on topics in computational biology and inclusion of minority students, will be carried out. 

The project will develop efficient approaches to identify expressed isoforms and to determine expression abundances, and then develop a network-reconstruction method which improves current state-of-art. The new computational methods will be validated and applied to the field of immunology--to study cellular mechanisms in steroid-producing cells. The project will make contribution in improvements over existing methods. First, the proposed methods for developing a scalable transcript assembler will enable accurate determination and quantification of the expressed isoforms, and make it possible to build regulatory networks at the level of isoforms to reflect the possible difference in regulatory mechanisms for different isoforms. Second, many recently developed methods for network inference require cells to be pre-ordered with trajectory inference or RNA-velocity to mimic time-series data. Errors in the cell ordering can mislead network inference and lead to false predictions. The project proposes to perform cell ordering and network inference simultaneously, which is expected to provide better results for both cell ordering and network inference.

"Non-technical abstract:
The goal of this project is to develop new ways of connecting electronics, biology, and information using living communities of bacteria. The majority of microbes on earth do not live as solitary cells. Instead, they form remarkably complex communities which are able to thrive in nearly every environment from the bottom of the ocean to the human gut. If we can integrate communities of bacteria with microelectronics, perhaps we could combine the impressive energy efficiency, environmental resilience, and multifunctional chemical sensing of bacterial biofilms, with the flexibility and programmability of modern semiconductors. The project engages the broader community by offering interdisciplinary courses on bioelectronics and computing, providing research opportunities for high school students and undergraduates, and organizing workshops that bring together researchers and industry representatives from different disciplines to investigate frontiers at the intersection of electronics, computing, and biology. These research goals and educational opportunities are relevant to many areas in the modern workforce, including computing, biotechnology, and synthetic biology.

Technical abstract:
This project explores hybrid information systems using bacterial biofilms integrated with semiconductor technology. Microbial biofilms are highly complex systems with emergent order, which can survive in widely varying environments. It was recently observed that Bacillus subtilis cells in biofilms can use ion channels to propagate electrical potential waves among populations of thousands of individual bacteria. Thanks to signal regeneration by downstream cells, these electrical signaling modes have the potential to travel farther than by diffusion alone, and they offer a unique opportunity for new modes of interfacing electronics and biology. The first goal of the project is to design a hardware platform which incorporates living biofilms on active custom semiconductor chips, which can both sense and actuate signaling within the biofilms. The second goal is to study the underlying mechanisms of electrical signaling and oscillations within single biofilms, as well as signaling between multiple nearby biofilms. The third goal is to utilize the electrical properties of the biofilm to encode abstract information written using addressable electrical stimulation, and to perform hybrid computations using programmable networks of coupled biofilm oscillators. These research activities are integrated with opportunities for cross-disciplinary educational programs involving both underserved Rhode Island students and the broader scientific community.

This SemiSynBio-II program (NSF 20-518) grant supports research to explores hybrid information systems using bacterial biofilms integrated with semiconductor technology with funding from the Division of Materials Research (DMR) of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate (MPS), the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) of the Biological Sciences Directorate (BIO),the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF) of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate (CISE), and the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) of the Engineering Directorate (ENG).

"Non-technical Description:
Biological microbes have developed complex mechanisms for working as a community to perform a range of collective tasks crucial to their survival. Inspired by the interactive behavior in microbial communities, the researcher is developing computational models to design synthetic materials systems that share information and through this communication, perform concerted functions. The research can facilitate the development of self-reporting, self-regulating materials that not only signal when the system deviates from normal operating conditions or “homeostasis”, but also restore the system to homeostatic conditions. Such self-regulating systems will lead to dramatic increases in energy efficiency since they do not require external intervention to maintain their functionality. These bio-inspired autonomously functioning materials can also bring about transformative changes in the field of soft robotics, enabling the fabrication of small-scale, interactive devices that cooperate to perform specified functions in the absence of external stimuli. The students and postdoctoral researchers involved in the project are participating in a highly interdisciplinary field, and through their research efforts are actively learning and synthesizing new ideas at the boundaries of synthetic biology, biomaterials and soft matter. In particular, they will be adapting the approaches of synthetic ecology, which aims to understand microbial colonies by constructing new functioning communities, to determine factors controlling interactions in the synthetic communicating materials. The field of synthetic ecology is still in its infancy and constitutes a new frontier in science; by training the next generation workforce and developing new modeling approaches, the research team can make a significant impact in the growth of this burgeoning area. Moreover, by applying concepts from synthetic ecology to synthetic materials, the investigators will develop new approaches for performing materials research.

Technical Description:
The research aims to design “communicating materials” that: 1) are self-reporting and self-regulating, 2) evolve their properties in response to environmental changes, and 3) share information to perform a range of collaborative functions. Despite advances in active soft matter and self-propelled particles, few synthetic systems mimic these modes of biological activity. The NSF ST2 workshop concluded that such communicating materials systems provide a useful construct for addressing fundamental questions that lie at the intersection of biomaterials, soft matter and synthetic biology. Furthermore, the realization of communicating materials can pave the way to new technological advances. The investigator is specifically using theory and simulation to design communicating materials from experimentally realizable synthetic microcapsules that interact through viable physical and chemical phenomenon. The work is yielding new computational models that encompass both the spatial and temporal behavior of assemblies of three-dimensional capsules; the hydrodynamic interactions between the capsules and surrounding solution; and chemical reactions occurring both within the capsules and in the outer solution. These models also incorporate feedback loops that mimic regulatory networks in biological cells. Using these approaches, the investigator is determining conditions that trigger the synthetic capsules to exchange chemical information and through this communication, perform concerted functions. The studies have the potential to elucidate fundamental physical and chemical phenomena that play a vital role in signaling and communication among biological cells. Notably, both the biological and synthetic communicating systems dissipate energy and operate out-of-equilibrium. Research on controlling the self-organization and collective dynamics of the communicating, interactive capsules can provide much-needed guidelines for harnessing dissipative, non-equilibrium behavior in bio-inspired, physical systems. By determining fundamental physicochemical principles that underpin behavior in biological microbial communities, these studies can provide a window into the physics of living systems and organization of primitive cellular communities at the origin of life.

"Non-Technical Description: 
This Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University of Minnesota features two Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs). The first team aims to access novel electronic and magnetic properties by direct application of strong local electric fields to promising new materials. This Quantum Leap aligned research will realize ready control over an extraordinary range of electronic phases and functions, thereby enabling new approaches to low-power magnetic data storage and processing, neuron-like computation, and nanophotonic devices such as solar cells. The second team is developing novel and systematic approaches to assembling polymeric materials into bicontinuous network structures with superior property combinations. These will advance multiple applications, including membranes for removal of viruses and bacteria, selective ion transport media for new battery designs, therapeutic delivery vehicles, and materials to manipulate light more efficiently in photovoltaic devices. The investigators provide extensive research experiences for promising undergraduates from a national network of four-year colleges, minority serving institutions, and especially tribal colleges. Summer camps for high school students, drawn from the Twin Cities and from Native American communities across the upper Midwest, involve senior investigators, students, and postdoctoral fellows in hands-on laboratory activities. Entertaining demonstration shows to illustrate fundamental scientific principles engage over 50,000 K-12 students each year. Close interaction with industry involves knowledge transfer in a pre-competitive collaboration with over 25 companies. Shared experimental facilities provide access to state-of-the-art materials characterization instrumentation to a national base of over 500 users.

Technical Description: 
IRG-1 aims to transform the understanding of mechanisms, capabilities, and applications of electrolyte-based gating, thereby realizing electrical control over an extraordinary range of electronic phases and function. Both electrostatic and electrochemical control are central to elucidating the biggest challenges facing ionic gating, and thus the development of ionic devices. These include understanding: when and why electrostatics vs. electrochemistry dominate; limits on speed, reversibility, and property modulation; interfacial structure, chemistry, and ion-carrier interactions; and universality of the approach. Three target materials classes are envisioned to tackle these issues – metal oxides, metal chalcogenides, and molecular conductors – chosen for alignment with key open issues and extraordinary functionality. The overarching goal of IRG-2 is to identify and translate design principles that direct small molecule self-assembly to oligomeric and polymeric shape-filling amphiphiles to form robust and functional mesoscopic network materials. Self-assembly strategies enable bottom-up design of nanostructured materials with tailored functionalities, accessing morphologies and properties exceeding those of their constituent building blocks. The interpenetrating microdomains of three-dimensional networks enable independent tuning of orthogonal properties in a single material. Crucially, the narrow composition windows over which networks typically form currently restricts their translation to applications. The team’s approach centers on identifying packing motifs that destabilize lamellar and cylindrical morphologies to broaden the composition phase windows of negative Gaussian curvature network phases. Control of phase selection and defect density by advanced processing in films and in bulk is also an important additional target.

"Nontechnical Abstract: The growth, prosperity, security, and quality of life of humans are in large part determined by the materials they use. The mission of the UC San Diego Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (UCSD MRSEC) is to perform innovative, interdisciplinary materials research relevant to societal needs, and to prepare students to become future leaders in materials design and discovery. The research effort of the Center is conducted within two highly interdisciplinary groups. The first group is deploying the most powerful computers available to understand, predict, and ultimately control the properties of materials at microscopic size scales—sizes just larger than molecular dimensions. It is in this size regime where many useful properties of materials emerge. For example, changes in the shape of metal particles at this scale can change their color, their efficiency as a catalyst, or their sensitivity in a medical diagnostic test. The second group is using the tools of the biotechnology revolution—in particular, genetic engineering and synthetic biology—to build new classes of materials that can respond to stimuli from their environment in useful ways. Both groups are targeting fundamental breakthroughs that can impact a number of critically important needs: faster, more accurate sensors for medical diagnostic tests, more efficient decontamination of chemical or biological hazards, better catalysts to reduce the cost of industrial processes, and improved therapeutics for treating diseases. The fundamental research within the two groups is empowered by an integrated educational program to prepare a diverse community of trainees to enhance national proficiencies in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. Immersive training for scientists across all levels – novice through established – develops technical competency in laboratory procedures, advanced instrumentation, and computational methods. Internship and scientist-in-residence programs fuel vital exchange of ideas and leverage partnerships with industry, national laboratories, and other collaborators. Partnership with the Fleet Science Center builds researchers’ skills in science communication and connects the UCSD MRSEC with the diverse San Diego community to address community-articulated needs. 

Technical Abstract: The UCSD MRSEC addresses two fundamental challenges: (1) How to predict and direct the assembly of materials at the mesoscale, where macroscopic behavior and properties emerge (IRG1: Predictive Assembly); and (2) How to deploy the tools of synthetic biology to build soft materials that meld the characteristics of living systems with the performance requirements of advanced engineered materials (IRG2: Stimuli-Responsive Living Polymeric Materials). IRG1 focuses on the rational design of innovative, functional mesomaterials with programmed plasmonic, catalytic, and structural properties. A computation-driven framework is being created to understand, predict, and design how shaped nanocomponents are used as material building blocks. The models developed bridge length and time scales relevant to mesoscale assembly. IRG2 integrates engineered living matter – photosynthetic organisms – into biological composites that respond to stimuli with genetically encoded outputs, such as chemical reagents and polymer feedstocks. The UCSD MRSEC creates unique resources to benefit the broader materials-research community: a MesoMaterials Design Facility – a virtual, computational facility, and an Engineered Living Materials Foundry, consisting of a bio-synthesis laboratory and soft-matter characterization tools. The Center’s educational goals include preparing the next generation of interdisciplinary materials scientists, and increasing diversity and inclusion in materials research. The Research Immersion in Materials Science and Engineering (RIMSE) Summer Schools provide intensive training in the areas of IRG research. Enabling professional development for Center members in science communication, a partnership with the Fleet Science Center facilitates meaningful engagement with the diverse San Diego community.

"Nontechnical:

An enormous challenge lies in developing nanoscale patterning methods to combine nanoelectronics with biological systems. Conventional patterning techniques have severe limitations when combining hard and soft materials. For example, electron beam lithography (EBL) can create patterns only a few nanometers in size, but requires sacrificial resists. These resists can be incompatible with biological materials and have environmental and safety concerns. Ice lithography is a novel technique that uses solid condensed gas instead of resist. This technique offers a path to atomically precise manufacturing to create nanophotonic and nanolectronic structures. There is, however, no such infrastructure in the United States. This conference will lay the foundations for a world-unique high precision facility that combines ice lithography with in-situ electron and scanning probe microscopy.

Technical:

The overarching goal of this multidisciplinary workshop is to bring together scientists and researchers from engineering, physics, chemistry, and biology in order to exchange ideas in recent innovations and trends in high resolution (below 5 nm) nanofabrication and characterization techniques. The workshop will highlight the science and technology at the cross-roads of quantum phenomena and bio-inspired materials. The natural self-assembly process, inherent to several classes of bio-inspired materials, has resulted in some of the most intriguing nanostructures. Tailoring the functionality of these structures remains a challenge that requires new processes for nanopatterning and nanofabrication. The workshop will provide a unique platform for researchers in academia and industry for envisioning a path forward towards advancing 3D nanofabrication, additive manufacturing, and nano-electronic devices using ice lithography. Additionally, the workshop will serve as a forum for integrating ideas on the synthesis and nanoscale characterization of functional nanomaterials and devices that seamlessly bridge condensed matter and biology. The workshop will lay the foundation for the establishment of future research infrastructure.

"Professor Shaowei Chen of the University of California-Santa Cruz is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry to develop new chemical bonding patterns to stabilize semiconductor nanoparticles with an organic protective layer.  Semiconductor nanoparticles are a unique family of functional materials that have found diverse practical applications.  A semiconductor has an electrical conductivity between that of a conductor, such as metallic copper, and an insulator, such as glass. Semiconductors are used in laser diodes, solar cells, electronic circuits, etc.  This research projects seeks to judicially select the chemical linkage to the surface of the semiconductor nanoparticles so as to tune their optical and electronic properties and enhance their use in optoelectronic devices, sensors and other practical applications.  In particular, the focus of this project is to enhance the photocatalytic activity of the nanoparticles in the use of light energy for efficient chemical conversions to specific products.  Graduate students are trained in advanced multidisciplinary research methods.  In addition, research activities are closely integrated with several educational and outreach programs to motivate minority, women, disadvantaged undergraduate students and qualified high-school students from the local area.  The research experience prepares these students for future careers in STEM areas. 
 
Semiconductor nanoparticles represent a unique class of functional nanomaterials that have found diverse applications, such as catalysis, optoelectronics, (bio)imaging, and (bio)diagnosis. Analogous to their metallic counterparts, semiconductor nanoparticles are generally functionalized with select organic capping ligands, ranging from small molecules to metal complexes and to polymeric matrices. In earlier studies, the semiconductor nanoparticle-ligand interactions mostly involved nonconjugated linkages, which significantly impeded the electronic coupling between the nanoparticle core and functional moieties of the capping ligands, so that a large amount of energy was needed to induce charge transfer across the interface. Such a barrier can be efficiently diminished with a conjugated core-ligand interfacial linkage. Thus, the central goal of the present research project is three-fold: to develop new interfacial chemistry for the surface functionalization of semiconductor nanoparticles, to examine the impacts of interfacial bonding interactions (conjugated vs. nonconjugated) on the nanoparticle optical and electronic properties, and to exploit these unique materials properties to enhance the materials applications in photocatalysis. Through a deliberate combination of theoretical and experimental studies, this research may enrich the toolbox of semiconductor nanoparticle surface functionalization, an important fundamental framework for enhanced applications.

"The bottom-up construction of synthetic cells that emulate specific biological functions has the potential to address certain societal problems related to human health and the environment. A serious limitation in the current state-of-the-art production of synthetic cells is the lack of basic knowledge of how particular membrane-associated functions can be engineered into the cells. Indeed, integrating membrane functions into synthetic cells requires a quantitative understanding of basic aspects of membrane-protein interactions and dynamics. The goal of this collaborative project is to advance our fundamental understanding of membrane protein functions in genetically programmed synthetic cells using a cutting-edge sensor technology.  This project, which is a collaboration between the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities (US) and the University of Exeter (UK), also aims to provide early career scientists with opportunities to do interdisciplinary research and to introduce cutting-edge biotechnology into the classroom of undergraduate students.   

This interdisciplinary project will provide novel quantitative information on various dynamic features of membrane proteins and their self-assembly by applying highly-sensitive whispering gallery mode single-molecule sensors to a set of three biological membrane functions recapitulated in a synthetic cell system: membrane channels, cytoskeleton and two-component signal transduction systems. The single molecule experiments will be paralleled by a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation approach to provide complementary information on large scales and collective effects of membrane proteins at the lipid bilayer. The research effort is divided into three objectives, to be carried out during the three-year project. First, the synthetic cell, consisting of a liposome loaded with a cell-free expression reaction to express the membrane proteins, will be set up on the single molecule sensor to monitor the insertion of native membrane protein channels and to characterize their activity. Second, we will use the whispering gallery mode sensors and the microbalance to monitor previously inaccessible adsorption kinetics of cytoskeletal proteins that mediate cell shape and division at the membrane of synthetic cell, as a function of lipid membrane properties. Third, the single molecule experiments will be performed by several independent sensing channels to characterize in real time biomolecular structural changes during signaling of a two-component system. Nanoseconds to hour’s detection timescales of sensor channels will provide information to analyze the hierarchy of protein motions in two component systems signaling, with respect to physical and chemical stimuli. The microbalance will provide information on the relationship between the membrane biophysical and biochemical properties of the membrane and the interaction between the proteins of the two-component system. This project will support the interdisciplinary training of undergraduates and post-doctoral researchers and aspects of the project will be integrated into curriculum of an undergraduate student course.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that sharing data is critical to building better statistical epidemiological models, enabling policy decisions (in the public and private sector), and assuring the health of the public. Moreover, the situation has evolved quickly, indicating that data sharing needs to take place repeatedly and in a timely manner. To date, much of the data sharing that has taken place has focused on aggregate statistics (e.g., counts of events), yet some of the most important data is at the person-level, which is critical to providing intuition into how comorbidities influence health outcomes and model the trajectory of the disease in a temporal-spatial perspective. This data is captured by a large number of service providers who wish to support these endeavors, but are concerned that doing so will infringe upon the privacy rights of the corresponding individuals, particularly their anonymity. To enable timely, useful and privacy-preserving releases of patient specific COVID-19 data, this project aims to develop and disseminate novel privacy-risk assessment techniques, implemented in working software, to assist data managers, as well as public health officials, to reason about the tradeoffs between privacy risks (with a focus on re-identification, according to current law) and public data utility. The project will provide the best practices and tools needed for sharing patient-specific data about individuals diagnosed with, or suspected of, COVID-19. 

This project will develop novel, and dynamic privacy risk assessment models for disclosing data in support of epidemiological investigations (and particularly pandemics) by considering evolving privacy risks and data utility. In doing so, the proposed models will be tailored to enable the disclosure of geographic-, demographic-, and clinically-relevant phenomena (e.g., health indications based on pharmaceutical prescriptions or purchases) by modeling a much richer data attribute space, specifically one that is important for modeling epidemiologic risk factors associated with biological agents, such as COVID-19. To model evolving privacy risks, privacy risk estimation models that consider multiple types of potential re-identification attacks and data redactions used to release multiple versions of the same data will be developed. Furthermore, the proposed models will be oriented to support utility functions that are specific to bio-surveillance efforts, including those which have emerged for COVID-19 modeling and response. Finally, to ensure that the proposed approach is accessible and reusable widely, an open source software tool, that enables data custodians, and particularly public health authorities, to make informed decisions appropriately balancing public health goals with personal privacy when sharing data, will be released.

"The NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site Earth Science on Volcanic Islands (ESVI) at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa’s (UHM) School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST) aims to support the education, training, and professional development of thirty emerging science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) undergraduate students from across the nation.  The ESVI REU Site provides a place-based learning and research environment supported by field excursions, thematic workshops and seminars, and research projects that target the significance of Earth science on volcanic islands. Students will have the opportunity to participate in a 10-week internship and conduct independent research on environmental, (bio)geochemical, geophysical, and oceanographic topics. Hawai‘i’s rich geologic setting allows students to explore geologic and environmental challenges of interest to society, including coastal erosion, sea level rise, landslides, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, and drought compounded by urban stresses. Recruitment will focus on engaging a diverse cohort of students, including students who are from historically underrepresented groups, such as Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI)  and students who are attending institutions that are STEM-limited. The goal of this REU is to provide students with a first-time exposure to field work and research, that will encourage them to consider future career opportunities in the geosciences. 

Emphasizing the unique place-based learning opportunities that the Hawaiian Islands provide, the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site Earth Science on Volcanic Islands (ESVI) at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa’s (UHM) School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST) is structured around a wide range of environmental, (bio)geochemical, geophysical, and oceanographic research. The objectives of the ESVI REU Site are to provide cutting-edge STEM research and professional development opportunities that will (1) Promote an increased participation of underrepresented groups, including NHPI students, as well as those from STEM-limited institutions, in the geosciences; (2) Expose students to extraordinary field excursions that illuminate the pioneering efforts of geoscientists studying Earth science on volcanic islands; (3) Strengthen students’ writing and presentation skills; (4) Foster a supportive, collegial, and connected relationship to enable long-term tracking of our REU students and follow their progress through graduate school and beyond. To meet these objectives, the ESVI REU Site requires a broad range of programmatic elements: (1) Maintenance of a strong REU site presence online and via social media that promotes the solicitation of applications from students with diverse backgrounds and levels of experience; (2) Collection of geophysical and geological data on a multi-day marine research expedition aboard the R/V Kilo Moana and organization of a multi-day field trip to Hawai‘i Island to observe active or very recent volcanism; (3) Provision of writing workshops and mentoring to assist with the development of oral/poster presentations and research reports; and (4) Facilitation of team-building activities throughout the REU program to promote a healthy, collegial, connected, and motivated cohort. Anticipated outcomes are a diverse cohort of students that will gain invaluable exposure to geoscience research and career opportunities, receive personal mentoring and skillset development on scientific writing and presentation delivery, perceive a beneficial and collegial association with the ESVI ‘ohana (family), and remain socially active with the ESVI program for many years to come.

"The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee received an award to investigate an electrical trapping technique to rapidly concentrate SARS-CoV-2 virus to produce highly pure samples for the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Currently, purification through multiple in-series applications of filtration and centrifugation require up to two days to prepare virus samples.  Unfortunately, the purity and viability of the separated viruses are still low after being collected by conventional methods. In this research, a correlation between the virus, nanoparticle size, and electrical dielectrophoretic trapping conditions is investigated to determine the best operating conditions to concentrate 80 – 160 nm size SARS-CoV-2. The developed method will enable the rapid concentration of pure viruses from cell culture and patient samples. The concentrated samples will enhance the development of vaccines, cures, and rapid diagnostic methods for infectious diseases by rapidly supplying highly concentrated pure virus samples. Thus, the research will contribute to improve the public safety related to infectious diseases and economy in the diagnostics and therapeutics area. The developed method is also applicable to the concentration of biomolecules, including DNA, protein, cell lysed fragments and particles, in addition to viruses. Thus, this research will give a substantial improvement on the rapid characterization and applications of molecules in various disciplines, such as virology, genomics, proteomics, diagnosis, forensic science, in addition to vaccine and therapeutics development. 

The novel dielectrophoretic nanoparticle manipulating method developed in this research can rapidly concentrate viruses into highly pure samples from virus-infected cell media and samples from patients. A charge polarization happens to a dielectric particle when the particle is exposed to an unevenly distributed electric field. The particle will move to either a dense or sparse electric field area depending on the given condition, such as electrical potential, frequency, and permittivities of the particle and medium. The direction of particle movement is inverted depending on the frequency; this is called cross-over frequency. The cross-over frequency varies depending on the characteristics of the particles, such as components, structure, charge, etc. In this research, the cross-over frequency of different bio-nano-particles, ranged from 60 to 500 nm size, will be investigated using heat-treated SARS-CoV-2 and nanoparticles. Initially, the cross-over frequency of different size nano-particles will be determined using dielectrophoretic traps, by modifying the applied potential, frequency, and particle size. Then, the same operating condition screening strategy will be applied to heat-treated SARS-CoV-2. Purity and efficiency of the isolated nano-particles and SARS-CoV-2 will be determined using the developed conditions. The developed method will circumvent the drawbacks that exist with the current serial treatment method used to separate virus, which are: time-intensive, laborious, complicated, and less effective. Consequently, this research will significantly enhance the understandings of the structures and characteristics of bio-nano-particles, such as live viruses, by supplying higher purity samples rapidly. Obtained results will be rapidly applied to other viruses and particles for further characterization and detection, as well as development of applications.  This RAPID award to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee is made by the Division of Biological Infrastructure using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

"The unprecedented growth of biopharmaceuticals in recent years has led to better strategies for managing chronic diseases in humans including diabetes, immunodeficiencies, and cancer.  These therapeutics are often produced using purified proteins extracted from biological sera, which has created a need for technologies that produce these proteins efficiently, quickly, and in sufficient quantities to meet the growing demand. The global market for biologics is the fastest growing market in the pharmaceutical industry with global revenues near $163 billion; it is expected to grow annually by 10.9%.  FDA approval rates for protein therapeutics increased threefold from 2013 to 2017.  There are currently over 200 approved biotherapeutic drugs on the market with over 1500 in clinical trials and more in the pipeline.  The work in this project seeks to aid bio-manufacturers in expanding their production capacity in existing facilities by developing an accurate computational simulation framework for describing new methods of protein separation strategies.  The simulation will be used with optimization algorithms to help engineers improve the performance of adsorption membranes which in turn will reduce bottlenecks in manufacturing.

This project is motivated by the need for efficient new separation and purification processes for protein therapeutics. The emergence of biologics, for example drugs derived from biotechnology, as a leading way to manage chronic diseases in humans has created a pressing need for lower cost, faster biomanufacturing operations to make these products available and more affordable for growing patient populations. This research project will develop numerical approaches to solve the mathematical descriptions needed to simulate these processes. The mathematical descriptions will incorporate new, more complex ion-exchange relationships that define the solid phase adsorption as an implicit function of the liquid phase adsorption, a significant change from the standard explicit mathematical relationships.  The goals of this project are to develop, validate, analyze, and use computational tools to inform the design of new, rapid membrane chromatography purification processes for bio-manufacturing environments.  Specifically, the research team will work on four major research activities: (1) development and testing of a computational framework; (2) analysis of computational models for nonlinear and implicit models of chromatographic adsorption processes; (3) validation of the computational tools using experimental data; and (4) simulation-based optimization using the developed computational framework to understand the effects of the design parameters on desired outcomes.

"This project generates enhanced understanding of how different microbial species cooperatively share nutrients. It adds to the knowledge base required to develop effective strategies to combat pathogens that exploit cooperative interactions to infect plants, animal and humans. By combining empirical experimental work and rigorous computational modelling, the research investigates how competition for limited nutrients influences the composition, stability and functioning of microbial communities. Tackling this problem requires students to be trained according to an interdisciplinary approach that combines synthetic biology, microbial population ecology, molecular biology and mathematical modeling. This project is training one graduate student and at least two undergraduate students in cutting-edge experimental and computational methods in microbial systems biology. The research results are being integrated into graduate and undergraduate classes, including a mathematical modeling course recently developed by the principal investigator. To broaden participation and enhance diversity, NSF-funded programs for women and minorities students are leveraged to identify and recruit project personnel. This project is a collaboration between researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (US) and the University of Exeter (UK).
 
Complex communities of diverse microbial species play essential roles in the proper functioning of natural ecosystems and the health of plant, animal and human hosts which they inhabit. To survive and grow, microbes must acquire limited nutrients from their environment. Metabolic interactions such as nutrient competition are key to the formation, stability and functioning of microbial communities. Nutrient acquisition frequently involves secretion of costly metabolic compounds that capture or breakdown resources in the external environment. This cooperative strategy, termed “public metabolism”, is risky as the breakdown products can be lost into the environment or exploited by other species. Preliminary data support the hypothesis that nutrient acquisition strategies involving either public or private metabolism represent two opposing approaches to survival, the success of which is environment dependent. The goal of this project is to test this hypothesis by applying a combination of experimental and computational approaches to two tractable synthetic systems involving the environmental yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the plant pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Both in vitro and in planta experiments will be performed and mathematically modeled to yield general conclusions about microbial interactions and community stability from system-specific observations.

"This project promotes fair and ethical treatment of veterans in the future job landscape by providing the empirical knowledge needed to remove implicit bias and misconceptions against veterans and prepare veterans for obtaining and maintaining competitive positions in the future workforce. Despite their strong work ethic and dedication, many veterans in the U.S still face major barriers to participating in the civilian workforce. After separation from duty, service members often participate in a week-long transition assistance program that, at best, can be described as a convenient “one-size-fits-all” solution. Research studying the limitations of the veteran population in entering this dynamically changing job market is scarce and does not provide a full understanding of the challenges faced by the veteran population as well as their train of thought during the time of the job interview. This project gathers empirical evidence to understand veterans’ common feelings, thoughts, and potential weaknesses in social effectiveness skills during the civilian job interviews. The project further provides a preliminary assistive technology enabled by artificial intelligence for promoting veterans’ interview skills in a tailored and inclusive manner, ultimately preparing them for the future workforce and broadening their participation in fields where they are traditionally underrepresented, such as computing. In addition to interview training, through effective partnerships with industry, this work creates educational materials for promoting unexplored strengths of the veteran population, such as commitment, reliability, and sense of duty, to the potential employers, thereby changing the job hiring culture and providing veterans with more opportunities in the future job landscape.

This project explores the above goals through a collaboration between computational and behavioral sciences for acquiring new insights into veterans’ experiences during civilian interviews and designing novel technologies for supporting veterans in this task. The research work will be carried out with three technical aims. The first aim is on data collection through focus group discussions and real-life interviews of veterans with industry representatives to identify challenging encounters during the interview. Data include behavioral reactions, physiological reactivity, and subjective assessments of both the interviewer and interviewee, which are examined in association with the interview setting and are further triangulated. The second aim will explore quantifiable measures of interviewees’ moment-to-moment stress based on their vocalizations, visual expressions, and physiological reactivity. These quantifiable measures are employed for the preliminary design of training interventions that can assist veterans on coping with stress during the job interview training. The third aim will examine the interviewee’s ability to engage with the interviewer. In particular, the researchers will develop new methods in natural language processing and affective computing for detecting overly formal conversational language specific to the military, as well as degradation in social aspects of the interaction from acoustic and visual cues.

"This project seeks to understand how cells control their shape and movement using synthetic biology tools.  Cell movement is essential for single cells to hunt and mate and for the correct development and function of multicellular organisms.  Sheet-like protrusions called lamellipodia are the engines that power and guide this motility.  However, the rules of their formation are not understood.  Similar to ant colonies where no individual is “in charge”, and the overall behaviors of a colony depends on simple rules of local interaction between ants, many aspects of cell biology are dominated by local rules of interaction between proteins.  This project seeks to define these rules of protein-protein interactions by constructing lamellipodia from synthetic, designer proteins whose patterns of interaction can be built to order.  This work is a collaboration between an expert in cell shape/movement (Orion Weiner at the University of California-San Francisco) and an expert in protein design (Dek Woolfson at the University of Bristol). STEM workforce diversity will be enhanced through multiple synergistic activities.  (1) reforming the grad school admissions process to make it more inclusive; (2) research opportunities for high school students from underrepresented groups and hands-on science demonstrations for teachers and elementary/middle/high-school students;  (3) engagement of a wider audience by presentations to the general public through the Exploratorium, Science Festival Discovery Days, and Science Cafés; (4) Engagement of policy makers and local and national industries to advocate for the use of designed proteins and systems in biotechnology;  (5) interdisciplinary training for three postdoctoral fellows and five high school students.  This work will strengthen links between US and UK labs and between the NSF and the BBSRC.

Weiner’s lab recently discerned the nanoscale organization of a key actin nucleator that suggests a self-organizing template for lamellipodia formation. These templates are not sufficiently understood to manipulate directly their biophysical parameters (such as linearity vs. curvature, rigidity, dynamics, etc.) and to probe fully the relation between actin nucleator oligomerization and cell shape and function. A powerful alternative to the typical genetic and biochemical approaches would be to build actin regulators from scratch, so that the molecular logic of cell shape and movement can be probed systematically. To do this, protein engineering and de novo protein design (Woolfson lab) will be used to generate synthetic proteins that assemble with defined geometries at membranes to nucleate actin, guided by our knowledge of the native system. These synthetic systems will be tested for their ability to support lamellipodial formation in vivo using cells defective in lamellipodia formation and ultimately in complete reconstitutions. These studies will advance protein design towards in-cell application, and, in turn, they will help define the molecular logic of cell shape and movement.

"This project will investigate the mechanism of sphingolipid synthesis to produce synthetic membrane vesicles in a test-tube starting from basic starting materials.  The vesicle synthesis technology is novel, and the vesicles have potential uses in synthetic biology, new healthcare technologies and industrial biotechnology and hence the potential to contribute to the bioeconomy.  This project will also contribute to the training of high school, undergraduate and graduate students and will be used in public outreach efforts. This project is a collaboration between researchers at Rutgers University (US), Duke University (US), and the University of Edinburgh (UK). 

One overarching goal of synthetic biology is to enable the building of synthetic cells in a more predictable and reliable manner.  Natural cells generate complex molecules and higher order structures such as the cell membrane that acts as a semi-permeable, external lipid barrier.  Cells also display an ability to alter their membrane composition in response to environmental changes (e.g. nutrients) and protect the cell from external threats (e.g. toxins, viruses).   Previous work has focused on membranes formed from simple phospholipids but the SynBioSphinx project will study sphingolipids since they are found in eukaryotic cell membranes and an increasing number of important microbes.  Eukaryotic sphingolipid enzymes are membrane bound and this has hampered the in vitro synthesis of sphingolipid-containing vesicles.  In contrast, bacterial enzymes that assemble the core sphingolipids are soluble and the sphingolipid-producing organism Caulobacter crescentus is an ideal system to study.  Moreover, sphingolipids in the bacterial membrane lead to increased sensitivity to bacteriophage, as well as resistance to the antibiotic polymyxin B. A fitness-based, adaptive resilience, selection screen will be used to identify the genes/enzymes in the bacterial sphingolipid-producing pathway.  Mass spectrometry will track the incorporation of labelled substrates (e.g. heavy L-serine) into bacterial membranes and sphingolipids.  A high-throughput screening strategy will identify novel glycosyltransferases that will alter the biophysical properties of the sphingolipid-containing bacterial and synthetic cell membranes.  Combined synthetic biology/mass spectrometry approaches will identify the optimal genetic circuits of four target biocatalysts to build a short, efficient sphingolipid pathway from small molecule metabolites.  Lastly, in vitro transcription/translation of the selected constructs will deliver cell-free synthesis of de novo vesicles which will be monitored via microscopy techniques.

"This US RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB)/Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe) collaborative project aims to improve data deposition, delivery, and management of three- dimensional (3D) macromolecular structure information stored in single global public data resource known as the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The PDB currently houses ~160,000 experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and nucleic acids. It is managed according to the FAIR Principles on an open access basis by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) partnership, which includes RCSB PDB, PDBe, Protein Data Bank Japan, and BioMagResBank. This project will transform the relatively static PDB archive into a living data resource composed of 3D structure information integrated with up-to- date annotations and metadata that relate each structure to its biochemical, cellular, or organismal context. Accurate data integration will help basic and applied researchers coming from agriculture to zoology, who are not experts in structural and computational biology, better understand and more fully utilize 3D structures in their day-to-day work in wet and dry laboratories. This new data repository will also enable 3D structural comparisons of proteins from different with similar or identical biochemical and biological functions thereby improving our understanding of protein evolution at the atomic level. The wwPDB maintains an information portal describing PDB global resources at https://www.wwpdb.org.

The    project    addresses    significant    software    engineering    challenges,    resulting   from growth in the number and size/complexity of newly deposited macromolecular crystallography (MX) and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (3DEM) structures, and the need to manage groups of related structures coming from serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) using X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFEL) and 3DEM. The project will improve the fidelity and completeness of 3D structure data deposited into the PDB by harvesting data automatically from structure determination software packages, and streamlining the wwPDB data deposition, validation, and biocuration system known as OneDep. The project will improve the accessibility of PDB data for researchers, educators, and students by extending chemical metadata for small-molecule ligands (e.g., bound cofactors and inhibitors), incorporating enhanced descriptions of macromolecular assemblies, grouping related PDB structures into investigations for more efficient, parallel data delivery; and creating a “Next Generation” PDB data repository with up-to-date metadata. Finally, the project will modernize wwPDB information technology infrastructure to futureproof PDB data management and weekly PDB archive release to the public domain by developing new application programming interfaces (APIs) and microservices infrastructure, and updating existing mechanisms for synchronization of data and software across wwPDB data centers in the US, Europe, and Asia. This work will directly benefit researchers, educators, and their students across the natural, physical, and engineering sciences.

"Three coronaviruses (SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2) have emerged from animals causing severe respiratory disease in humans. Little is known about the virus-host interactions which control disease severity and transmission, leaving society unprepared for the COVID-19 pandemic. An animal model that closely mimics SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis is needed to better inform and educate about the science of virus transmission and prevention. Mice are infected with their own, mouse-specific coronavirus [mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)] that causes respiratory disease and affects other organs, such as the heart, liver and spleen, like COVID-19. This proposal will utilize a MHV model of COVID-19 to understand disease progression and the factors involved using controlled conditions. The mouse model takes advantage of available mouse genetic tools, immunologic reagents, and detailed pathologic assessments to identify host factors, such as the type of immune cell infiltrates and cytokines produced that are associated with different disease severities. This analysis will provide insight into protective and deleterious host responses, which can identify processes to target for therapeutics. The development of this model system has the potential to be an efficient and cost effective tool to identify and screen treatment and prevention strategies that warrant escalation to more specific COVID-19 models, thereby making the best use of the limited infrastructure resources associated with the ABSL-3 requirements of actual SARS-CoV2 use.  This is a Broader Impact because it will benefit society in the quest for COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines. 
 
Models of all levels of SARS-CoV2 disease in genetically diverse populations are urgently needed. It is hypothesized that the host and virus factors controlling the severity of coronavirus respiratory infections can be identified using natural murine coronavirus infections in diverse, yet genetically defined cohorts of mice. MHV are natural pathogens of mice that are well adapted to their host and vary in both their tropisms and their disease phenotype. The range of pathological lesions and host responses caused by MHV-1 and MHV-A59, with different virulence in the respiratory tract, will be characterized. The eight genetically diverse Collaborative Cross founder mouse strains will be used to represent the genetic diversity seen in large human populations. These studies will focus on lung pathology, but the heart, liver, kidney and spleen will also be evaluated. Mice will be inoculated with MHV-1 or MHV-A59. Tissues will be examined for pathologic changes. Fibrosis and immune cell infiltrates will be characterized using histochemical stains and immunohistochemistry. Viral titers, serum chemistry, coagulation, neutralizing antibodies and cytokines will be measured. Correlations between MHV strain, mouse strain, viral load, clinical disease, pathological lesions, and immune reactions will be determined. These studies are the first step to increase knowledge about the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infections.  This RAPID award is made by the Symbiosis, Defense, and Self-recognition Program in the BIO Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, and, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. It was co-reviewed by the BIO Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology Genetic Mechanisms cluster.

"A type of white blood cells called B cells play a critical role in our immune system by producing antibodies to combat various infections. However, B cells are not on alert all the time; they need to be selectively activated to proliferate and change (differentiate) to become antibody-producing cells in a special physiological microenvironment called the germinal center (GC). Due to its complicated structure, function, and dynamically evolving nature, creating a fully functional GC model ex vivo (outside the body) is extremely challenging, and thus requires an interdisciplinary and comprehensive engineering approach. This CAREER project seeks to develop a purely artificial GC model system by recreating the most critical components of the GC capable of inducing a full array of B cell reactions. Using the ex-vivo model system with precise and independent control over each critical parameter, the roles of these GC components in producing B cell reactions will be investigated in unprecedented detail compared to using conventional in-vivo (inside the body) observations. These outcomes will enable critical advancement of various fields, including vaccination, immunotherapy, autoimmune diseases, and cancers. As complementary educational and outreach plans of the highly interdisciplinary project, focus has been made on three aspects: 1) the development of effective curricula for immunoengineering that teaches the topics at the interface between immunology and engineering, 2) the creation of uniquely collaborative environment for education and research among academia, local research institutes, and industry partners, and 3) the promotion of underrepresented high school and college students in Northern Alabama to be engaged in immunoengineering and general STEM fields.

The investigator’s long-term research goal is to develop translational cellular and molecular immunotherapies for cancers, infections, and autoimmune diseases through the unconventional amalgamation of biomaterials engineering and immunology, namely immunoengineering. Towards this goal, this CAREER project will develop an artificial ex-vivo model system that enables the mimicry of the most important functional feature of the geminal center (GC):  to create B cells that can produce affinity-matured antigen-specific antibodies.  Despite tremendous achievements in B-cell biology and immunology, no artificial model system has yet been fully capable of recapitulating all the critical features of the GCs ex vivo. Motivated by findings from state-of-the-art GC models, this project hypothesizes that there are three critical components of the GC microenvironments, without the correct mimicry of which, the recapitulation of ex-vivo GC reactions would be impossible: 1) the optimal CD40L-CD40 signaling that requires help signals from T-follicular helper (TFH) cells, 2) the zonal structure of the GC and interzonal migration between the light zone (LZ) and the dark (DZ) of the GC B cells, and 3) the temporally controlled on-and-off B cell receptor (BCR) signals that require antigen presentations from follicular dendric cells (FDCs).  The Research Plan is organized under three objectives that address each of the identified critical components.  Each objective includes development of systematically controllable biomaterial platforms that will provide critical biological signals and microenvironments to artificially developing GC B cells.  The FIRST Objective is to control the quality and quantity of the CD40 signaling provided by follicular helper T (TFH) cells, by providing CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154) molecules on bio-mimetic/bio-responsive viscoelastic hydrogels that have tunable modulus and stress relaxation characteristics.  The expected outcome is enhanced understanding of how to control the quantity and quality of signaling events by designing mechanical properties of biomaterials platforms for the presentation of ligands to cell-surface receptors, especially to various molecules of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily to which CD40L belongs.  The SECOND Objective is to provide a microenvironment mimicking the zonal structures of GC (DZ and LZ) by creating controlled chemokine gradients within a microfluidic device for the artificial GC B Cells. By providing a controlled chemokine gradient using microfluidic devices, a systematic study about the conditions that enable artificially activated B cells to migrate and the consequences of the interzonal migrations in terms of GC reactions will be enabled.  The THIRD Objective is to introduce On and Off temporal regulation of BCR signaling via reversible surface conjugation of model antigens to microbead-based artificial FDCs, hypothesizing that the BCR signaling needs to be temporally regulated on-and-off in order to enable an extended proliferation of GC B cells  The expected outcome is a clearer understanding of the role of BCR signaling in GC reactions.  Finally, the outcomes of this project are expected to enable realization of a functional artificial ex-vivo GC model that could: 1) facilitate the development of novel vaccines against major pathogens for which no effective vaccines are yet available by enabling recognition of novel B-cell epitopes without T-cell dependency, 2) be developed as a linearly scalable cell-manufacturing platform for generation of antigen-specific effector B cells as adoptive cell therapy, and 3) serve as a better-controlled and more cost-effective model system in biomedical sciences that studies B-cell biology and B-cell malignancies.

"Developing synthetic routes to polymers consisting of a defined sequence of monomers is a current challenge in chemistry. Proteins are natural polymers, and are specific sequences of amino acids put together easily and efficiently by the living cell. The NSF Center for Genomically Encoded Materials (C-GEM) takes a bio-inspired approach making a sequence of synthetic polymers by re-engineering the cell's systems.  In this case, the cell becomes a new translational machine that synthesizes new chemical polymers of specific sequence and length. NSF C-GEM establishes a new, transformative field of chemistry and fosters innovation at the chemistry-biology-materials frontier. The applications of the new materials with novel properties range from information storage to anti-counterfeiting and drug delivery, from environmental remediation to drug discovery. NSF C-GEM engages scientists and non-scientists in a variety of research and educational activities, including improved communication to the public. These education and participation programs integrate research with training to establish a diverse chemical workforce. NSF C-GEM presents a new online platform and data management system, GEM-Net, to promote data sharing within and outside the research team. NSF C-GEM is also developing an online video game that allows citizen scientists to participate in the research process and track results. 

The NSF Center for Genomically Encoded Materials, NSF C-GEM, is focused on the challenge of preparing polymers whose monomers and dispersity are defined with protein-like control. Sequence-defined polymers possess extraordinary potential for information storage, anti-counterfeiting, drug delivery, environmental remediation, and even drug discovery, but strategies to prepare them are barely in their infancy. NSF C-GEM's approach synthesizes sequence-defined chemical polymers by repurposing the E. coli translational apparatus. The translation machinery, which normally promotes bond formation between alpha-amino acids, now promotes bond-forming reactions between monomers that are the building blocks for aramids, polyolefins, polyurethanes, and other polymers. The approach demands orthogonal enzymes that acylate orthogonal tRNAs with each monomer, efficiently and in vivo; orthogonal ribosomes that accept these tRNAs as substrates and elongate the products; genomically-recoded organisms with multiple open codons to enable mRNA-templated synthesis of sequence-defined polymers; and high-resolution structural data to deepen understanding and inform design. The project develops the multi-disciplinary tools and technologies that demonstrate the proof of concept of the approach and establish practical methodologies to this aim. NSF C-GEM fosters innovation at the chemistry-biology-materials frontier, and engages scientists and non-scientists in research and educational activities. A diverse set of education and participation programs integrates research with training, establishes a diverse chemical workforce, and improves communication with the public.","Berkeley","University of California-Berkeley","47.049","826506","Phase I Ctrs for Chem Innovati","2021739","schepartz@berkeley.edu","Alanna","Schepartz","02/27/2020","07/01/2019","08/31/2021","CCI Phase I: NSF Center for Genomically Encoded Materials (C-GEM)","BIO"
"During the current coronavirus pandemic, there is a shortage of masks that are part of personal protective equipment used by health care workers. This shortage is due to two reasons: (i) supply has been outstripped by unprecedented demand, and (ii) current masks are meant to be used only once and then discarded. Critically, the lack of proper and effective personal protective equipment poses a significant risk to healthcare workers that are treating and caring for COVID19 patients. This RAPID project seeks to remedy these issues by fabricating novel and improved filters using polymers derived from natural sources (agriculture and forestry) that are compostable. These filters would be removable, renewable, and  reusable. Furthermore, these filters would incorporate small-sized antimicrobial/antiviral copper particles, which enhance the effectiveness of masks beyond current capabilities. This project will rapidly develop and optimize the fabrication of these filters. Developed filters will be tested to demonstrate that they have all the properties required for masks to be worn by medical personnel. If the research is successful, it will result in the development of a reusable medical mask that is superior to the single-use mask currently in use. Finally, the project will promote collaborations across different fields such as wood science, health science, engineering, chemistry and biology which, in turn, will support training and education of students in these fields.

The overarching objective of this RAPID  research project  is to develop a prototype for a reusable and environmentally friendly biofilter with antimicrobial and antiviral properties to be used as a filtering facepiece respirator. This objective will be attained with the use of bio-nanocomposites of polylactic acid in combination with cellulose nanofibrils and coated with copper nanoparticles. The result will represent improvements on current medical masks, including the design, fabrication processing and material properties. Process development will involve mixing cellulose nanofibrils into polylactic acid and converting the compounded material into filaments coated with copper nanoparticles, rendering the material suitable for additive manufacturing of the reusable biofilter. The copper nanoparticles will endow the filter with antimicrobial and antiviral properties, while the properly-dispersed nanocellulose will help to retain the microorganisms and also provide mechanical integrity. It is expected that masks using these filters will have the ability to both prevent penetration by microorganisms (having a diameter as small as 50 nm) and to kill many infectious agents as well. Rejuvenation of the filter will be done with the help of mild heat treatment. The structure and properties of the filters will be determined using standardized tests. The ability to compost polylactic acid will be helpful in the eventual disposal of the filter. If successful, the research will result in the development of a reusable respirator mask that is superior to the present-day mask. This will help to ease the shortage of personal protective equipment for health care workers and give them the best possible protection against microbial threats such as COVID19. Finally, the successful completion of the project will advance the knowledge and understanding of bio-nanocomposite components compatibility, and their specific effects on the final material performance within the context of engineering and technology education. This new knowledge will be generated across different fields such as wood science, health science, engineering, chemistry and biology. The proposed work will support synergies among these disciplines and foster training and education of students in these fields.

"Fishes are masters of locomotion in fluids owing to their highly integrated biological sensing, computing and motor systems. They are adept at collecting and exploiting rich information from the surrounding fluids for underwater sensing and locomotion control. Inspired and informed by fish swimming, this research aims to develop a novel bio-inspired cyber-physical system (CPS) that integrates the ?physical? robot fish and fluid environment with the ?cyber? robot control & machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this CPS system includes i) a pressure sensory skin with distributed sensing capability to collect flow information, ii) control and learning algorithms that compute robot motor signals, output by central pattern generators (CPGs) which receive pressure sensory feedback, iii) a robot fish platform to implement and validate the CPS framework for underwater sensing and control tasks, and iv) experimental and computational methods to investigate and model the underlying fluid physics. This CPS system will have immediate impacts on the core CPS research areas such as design, control, data analytics, autonomy, and real-time systems. It will also significantly impact a wide range of engineering applications which demand distributed sensing, control and adaptive actuation. Examples include human-machine interactions, medical robots, unmanned aerial/underwater vehicles, drug dosing, medical therapeutics, and space deployable structures among others. Leveraging the multidisciplinary nature of this research, this award will support a variety of educational and outreach activities. In particular, a list of activities in broadening participation in engineering will be carried out.

      This research project integrates multiple CPS technologies to develop bio-inspired technologies for swarm control of fish. These include inthanovations in a pressure sensitive skin  project will first develop a distributed pressure sensitive synthetic skin, which will be installed on robotic fishes to map the pressure distribution on their body and caudal-fin surfaces. The distributed pressure information will then be used in a feedback control policy that modulates CPGs to produce caudal-fin motion patterns of the robotic fishes. The control policy and the caudal-fin motion patterns will be optimized via reinforcement learning first in a surrogate fluid environment and then in the true fluid environment. The surrogate fluid environment will be developed using data-driven non-parametric models informed by physics-based hydrodynamic models of fish swimming, trained using combined experimental and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation data. The above control-learning methods will also be used to achieve efficient schooling in a group of robotic fishes, individually controlled by a CPG, which interacts with each other through surrounding fluids and pressure sensory feedback. The optimized swimming/schooling performance of robotic fishes and the underlying physics will be studied using CFD simulation. Together, this research will advance CPS knowledge on: 1) the design and creation of electronic and sensor materials and devices for robot skin applications; 2) the development of data-efficient, physics-informed learning methods for robotic systems that operate in complex environments, especially leveraging the recent progress on deep learning to exploit the spatial and temporal richness of the pressure data for underwater sensing and robot control; and 3) the flow physics and modeling of fish swimming.

"For decades, it has been clear that soil microbes strongly affect plant health. For this reason, plant microbiomes—which mostly come from soil—have great potential to help improve agricultural productivity and restore damaged ecosystems. Because microbiomes are so complex, it is unclear how and why they affect plants. Part of the answer may lie in the evolutionary histories of plants and their microbiomes, which share a habitat and therefore must adapt to the same environmental stresses, such as drought. The research funded by this award will test the hypotheses that (1) drought-adapted soil microbiomes help plants tolerate drought, and (2) drought-adapted plants help soil microbes survive drought. DNA sequencing will be used to identify differences in drought-adapted versus non-adapted soil microbiomes. Then, physiological and biochemical techniques, such as CT-scanning of root structures, will reveal the effects of those drought-adapted and non-adapted microbiomes on plant health. These experiments will be done using both corn and Eastern Gamagrass, a native species. This research has the potential to improve current methods for predicting the effects of soil microbes on plant health, and thus impact agriculture and conservation practices. This award will also grow the American scientific workforce by supporting the training of one post-doctoral researcher, one Ph.D. student researcher, and two undergraduate student researchers. Finally, this award supports a portable museum exhibit that brings scientific content to hundreds of people in rural communities across Kansas.
	
This project is motivated by the lack of knowledge of how adaptation to a shared environmental stressor affects plant-microbiome interactions. Because root microbiomes are derived from soil, the constituent microbial lineages encounter environmental stressors both with and without a host. Whether the same microbial genes and traits contribute to stress tolerance and survival in both situations, or whether there is a fitness tradeoff between host-associated vs. free-living stages is not clear. Similarly, it is unknown whether microbiome adaptation to a given environmental challenge impacts the ability of a plant host to withstand the same challenge.  To address these questions, drought will be used as a model stressor. First, shotgun metagenome sequencing of soils from across two natural precipitation gradients will characterize how historical water limitation shapes community-wide gene content, after controlling for variation in soil structure and chemical content measured using 3D X-ray CT and ICP-MS, respectively. Second, repeated metagenome and metatranscriptome sequencing will test for changes in the frequency and expression of microbial genes in natural soils after six months of experimentally induced drought. This experiment will be replicated in mesocosms both with and without plant hosts. Finally, the effects of drought-adapted and non-adapted soil microbiomes on plant physiology and drought tolerance will be measured using growth assays, RNA-seq, ionomics, and laser ablation tomography. This research may disentangle the genetic, physiological, and ecological interdependencies that shape the evolution of plant microbiomes.

"Fracture and wear are common issues in engineering - to the extent that the terms ""worn,"" ""fractured,"" and ""broken"" are generally synonymous with the end-of-utility of devices. In many cases, traditional materials fail to meet the complex, simultaneous performance requirements that would be ideal for next generation engineering systems. The enamel of the teeth of grazing animals represents one of nature's most remarkable biological materials -- a ceramic-like composite showing exceptional strength, toughness, wear-resistance, and ability to slow crack propagation. This is an important set of properties for a structure that is key to long-term survival in these animals - as functional teeth are required for feeding.  This EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will study these damage-tolerant biomaterials using a combination of evolutionary biology, biomechanics, and materials science. Results and methods from this research will be of considerable interest to investigators in many disciplines, including engineering, materials science, evolutionary biology, ecology, comparative anatomy, mammalogy, and paleontology. The research will also support the development of novel, sustainable materials with improved wear and fracture behavior. Graduate students will be involved in this truly interdisciplinary project and learn how the various fields can work together to tackle challenging questions.  This research will also introduce a more effective, evolutionary approach for exploring nature for biomimetic examples.

The goal of this interdisciplinary research is to specifically understand the biomechanical form, function and performance of enamel lattices, known as Modified Radial Enamel (MRE), in the grinding teeth of large herbivorous mammals.  Samples will be obtained from numerous species, including equines (horses), bovids (e.g. bison and cattle) and suids (e.g. warthogs). This study will specifically focus on how these animals' teeth endure tens to hundreds of millions of high stress contact loading cycles and impacts while chewing tough and abrasive plant matter, such as grasses whose roots are laden with hard, fracture-promoting sediment inclusions. The underlying hypothesis is that MRE is an evolutionarily optimized compromise for: 1) incredible fracture resistance due to prism arrangements that localize damage and strategically control crack direction; 2) unexpected strength and toughness made possible by compliant proteinaceous prism sheaths that circumvent hydroxyapatite's inherent brittleness; and 3) wear resistance conveyed through hard, hyper-mineralized, oriented enamel prisms. The project will investigate this hypothesis through two objectives.  First, the study will use an evolutionary biology approach to identify the ancestral enamel fabric character states to MRE that independently evolved in horses, bovids and warthogs. From this information, it will be possible to readily identify the specific evolutionary modifications to the enamel fabrics that enabled grinding and identify living species that can be used to undertake comparative biomechanical assessment.  Second, the project will investigate the structure-property relationships of the enamel across multiple length scales by comprehensively characterizing the material properties using micro-and nano-mechanical tools, spectroscopy, and advanced electron microscopy. Teeth of grinding species with MRE will be compared with close relatives that retain the ancestral enamel fabrics, thereby revealing the salient anatomical changes that enabled the optimized combination of biomechanical properties.

"In 2018, as part of NSF’s 10 Big Ideas, a workshop (also known as an Ideas lab) on ‘Building a Synthetic Cell’ was held to identify projects at the frontiers of science and engineering that would use synthetic approaches to build cells from first principals. Seven such projects were identified and funded and the meeting funded through this proposal will serve to bring the successful groups together to discuss their progress in the year since funding began. Pursuing the goal of building living cells from inanimate chemistry provides significant opportunities to advance US bio-manufacturing in biotechnology, biomedicine and materials research as well as providing a unique educational and training opportunity for students and post-docs involved in the projects.

The meeting will provide a forum for US scientists and bio-engineers to outline their most recent work on creating cells comprised of molecules with opposite chirality, building artificial neurons and constructing cells without lipids among other cutting edge synthetic biology projects. The meeting will allow time for the exchange of research ideas between scientific groups and networking opportunities for both junior and senior scientists.

"In the current state of pandemic COVID 19, use of personal protective equipment  e.g. medical gowns, gloves, facemasks, etc.) stand as the primary line of defense for preventing infection. Communication of the pathogen occurs directly, from person to person, as well as through cross-contamination from surface to surface. Current forms of personal protective equipment only provide user protection from infection by functioning as a physical barrier. Incorporation of virus-binding polymers and anti-viral nanomaterials with current forms of personal protective equipment can allow the ‘capture’ and ‘killing’ of virus species: protecting medical personnel/first responders and subsequently preventing the spread of contagions, such as the novel coronavirus. This RAPID proposal, supported by the nanoscale interaction program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, explores the nano-scale interactions between virus species and medically relevant nanomaterials. The project will utilize bio-compatible polymer nanolayers embedded with local UV light emitting nanoparticles as a model system for the future design of nanomaterial-based anti-viral coatings. Results from this study will demonstrate the efficacy of such nanomaterial platforms towards inactivating harmful viral pathogens as well as elucidate virus-biomedical material interactions. Such valuable information will be disseminated to the public for better design of improved and more effective personal protective equipment in the containment of coronavirus and other pathogens.
 
Viral pathogens pose a significant threat to humanity. The COVID-19 pandemic typifies this threat with substantial, crippling impact on the global social structures and economics already felt. Current forms of personal protective equipment function solely as physical barriers to infection/viral transmission (e.g. hospital gowns, medical face masks, gloves, etc.). Ideal personal protective equipment should directly inactivate the virus, upon contact: thereby assuring against user infection as well as preventing cross-contamination through surface to surface contact. In this RAPID project, we propose the design of a multi-layer, bio-compatible nano-polymer coating on personal protective equipment surfaces. These layers will further be seeded with complex oxide nanoparticles which absorb white/natural light and release local UV light to inactivate adsorbed virus agents. Additionally, specific polymers in the coating will be chemically modified with virus surface protein binding oligomeric molecules. The advantage of studying such interaction is twofold: (1) surface proteins are blocked from interacting with host cells (preventing infection) and (2) virus species are retained at the personal protective equipment surface allowing sufficient dosing of nanoparticle-mediated UV light. The combination of anti-viral nanoparticles and virus-selective oligomers will function as a model for future, nanomaterial-based, products effecting a ‘capture’ and ‘kill’ approach. Specifically, this interdisciplinary study between engineering and biomedical sciences will highlight nanoscale binding interactions (oligomer-protein, polymer-virus membrane) and the efficacy of nano-emitters in anti-viral platforms. The data collected will educate and inform the general public on diverse, relevant subjects; including outreach to various audiences. The model is designed to be highly generalizable to other virus types and for incorporation of nanomaterials with varying chemical, optical, or biological modes of action.

"Non-technical description:

Photonic integrated circuits (ICs) have enabled many applications such as optical communication, bio-sensing, and quantum communication. To utilize the full functionality of photonic ICs, integrated electronic-photonic circuits are demanded, an essential component of which is an economical, silicon-compatible, and electronically addressable laser in the photonic IC. In the visible wavelengths, although epitaxially grown III-N semiconductors are the main gain medium candidate for on-chip lasers, they lack silicon-compatibility and is expensive. This proposal explores solution-processed metal-halide perovskites as alternative gain media and develops perovskite laser diodes on the silicon platform. By judiciously engineering the gain medium composition and band alignment of carrier transport layers with perovskite gain, employing defect-passivation, and designing for low-threshold laser cavities, environmentally stable perovskite laser diodes can be realized. The family of perovskite lasers developed in this program will enable efficient and low-cost integrated photonic solutions for confocal microscopy, on-chip fluorescent sensing, and flow cytometry in the bio-photonics area, as well as visible light communication and on-chip quantum emitters in the optical communication area. It will also help closing the “green gap” where conventional epitaxially grown inorganic semiconductors suffer from low efficiencies, and advance the field of solution-processed semiconductor lasers. The educational portion of the program aims to increase public awareness of photonics and to pipeline qualified students to help advance the U.S. photonics industry.

Technical description:

A crucial yet unavailable component in high-performance visible-wavelength photonic ICs and other chip-scale photonic systems is a silicon-compatible on-chip laser that is efficient, stable, economical, and electronically addressable. So far, III-N lasers are the main candidates, but their material platform requires complex epitaxial growth and lattice constant matching to the silicon substrate. Although solution-processed metal-halide perovskites have been suggested as alternative gain media, and many perovskite lasers have been demonstrated so far, all perovskite lasers to date are optically pumped. Additionally, they operate under ultrafast pulsed pumping and/or at cryogenic temperatures and have a short lifetime. This program starts by developing economical, environmentally stable and silicon-compatible perovskite lasers that operate under continuous wave optical pumping at room temperature. This can be achieved by directly patterning perovskite into high-Q laser resonators with the manufacturing friendly nanoimprint lithography, then defect-passivating the perovskite with polycarbonate. This program further aims to demonstrate electrically pumped perovskite lasers through band alignment tailoring of carrier transport layers for efficient current injection, perovskite-polymer blending for minimal leakage current, low-loss electrode formation to reduce wasteful non-radiative recombination at electrodes, and low-threshold laser cavity design. This work will not only lead to the insertion of perovskite lasers into functional photonic ICs, but also the long-sought-after realization of solution-processed laser diodes. On a more system level, this work will enable the connectivity between the photonic “plane” and electronic “plane” in multi-functional adaptive photonic/electronic integrated systems.

"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY

Polyurethanes are ubiquitous in a range of consumer products from athletic goods to automotive parts, showcasing their versatility to address a variety of application needs. Typically manufactured utilizing petroleum feedstocks, the continued use of polymers, such as a polyurethanes, is impacted by questions around recyclability and environmental impacts. The transformation of biomass into value-added polymers is a promising route to develop materials with comparable performance and lower cost, and that can be designed for an optimal product lifecycle. Utilizing wood biomass, the team will design, synthesize, and characterize high-performance polymers, investigate more sustainable approaches to the generation of polymers, and study the influence of wood diversity on material properties and environmental impact.  These bioderived polymers have potential applications as membranes, elastomers, and foams. 

Sustainability in the context of new materials design will be leveraged as a framework for broadening participation in science and engineering fields at all levels -– K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and aspiring faculty -- via strategic partnerships, mentoring activities, and educational activities. High school internships and research opportunities will prepare underrepresented students for science and engineering college pathways. Mentoring activities for female graduate students and post-docs will be implemented, focusing on shared experiences and sustained dialogue. Diversifying the professoriate with a focus on soft materials will be targeted via an annual workshop, expanded to include concepts of collaborative, multidisciplinary research.  

TECHNICAL SUMMARY

Alternative synthetic approaches are critical for the utilization of biomass building blocks in the development of robust polymeric materials with exceptional mechanical function and thermal properties. Lignocellulosic biomass, particularly the lignin fraction, is an attractive source of diverse, abundant, and inexpensive precursors for macromolecular design. Bisguaiacols, such as the newly-developed bisguaiacol A (BGA) –- an entirely bio-based, methoxy-substituted analogue to bisphenol A (BPA) -- are robust and potentially safer components for the design of polymeric systems with enhanced properties. Utilizing lignin-based biomass as a primary synthetic precursor, the PIs will investigate the following strategies in the design of sustainable routes for bio-based polymeric materials – polysulfones (PSFs) and polyurethanes (PUs) with enhanced material properties: (i) synthesis of new bisguaiacol analogues for BPA-replacements for polymerization; (ii) development of schemes for ‘green’ PU synthesis; (iii) exploration of the influence of biomass source on thermomechanical behavior; (iv) construction of structure-property-processing relationships; (v) toxicity assessment of these bisguaiacol-based polymers; (vi) examination of reprocessability in bisguaiacol-derived PU networks; and (vii) exploration of additive manufacturing conditions and post-functionalize strategies for scale-up. Expertise in materials science, polymer chemistry, and chemical engineering will drive this fundamental research program that spans the inclusion of diverse lignin sources, synthesis of sustainable building blocks, macromolecular design and characterization, and manufacturing of ‘green’ polymers for a diverse set of applications.

"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY
Biological molecules are capable of interacting with inorganic materials, giving rise to highly controlled material synthesis and the creation of new bio-inorganic materials with unique function and properties. However, little is known about the molecular interactions between the biological molecules with inorganic materials. One of the most well studied proteins that controls the growth of inorganic materials is ferritin, which is a natural biomineralizing protein and is responsible for controlling the growth of iron oxide nanoparticles and maintaining proper levels of free iron in the cell. The focus of this CAREER project is to extend the powerful methods of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) along with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy methods (HRTEM) used in materials science to ferritin macromolecules in the process of nanomaterial growth. This project will ultimately make significant contributions to both the understanding of how the important ferritin protein functions and the general molecular interactions of biomolecules with nanomaterials. The next major advances in the field of biomolecule driven nanomaterial synthesis will be the ability to rationally design biomolecules for novel, highly controlled nanostructure synthesis. One of the biggest roadblocks to achieving these goals is the lack of understanding of how these biological molecules interface with the inorganic nanomaterials. The new cryo-EM methods developed in this proposal and the new knowledge gained about ferritin mediated nanoparticle synthesis will be able to be extended to many other biological-nanomaterial systems. Additionally, the project will initiate an interdisciplinary education program that educates the public and trains the next generation of scientists and engineers at the intersection between biology and materials science.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY
Despite the fact that ferritin is one of the most well-studied protein-nanoparticle systems, the fundamental interactions between ferritin and iron oxide nanoparticles grown inside its hollow core are not well-understood. The research in this CAREER proposal will produce new knowledge by determining the high-resolution structures of ferritins in the process of inorganic nanomaterial formation, from initial iron oxide nucleation to formed nanoparticles. The goal of correlating ferritin structure with the process of nanoparticle growth and ultimate material structure will be accomplished through the following technical objectives: (1) Elucidate the process of ferritin-controlled nanoparticle growth by high-resolution time-resolved single particle cryo-EM; (2) Determine the molecular interactions at the protein-nanoparticle interface by combined protein and nanomaterial structure determination. The project will make novel use of cryo-electron microscopy along with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and the combined use of both of these techniques on biomineralizing ferritin will require the development, optimization, and implementation of new methods for both techniques. The project aims to answer fundamental mechanisms of ferritin-controlled nanoparticle growth at the bio-inorganic interface, and the influences this interface has on the resulting iron oxide nanoparticle structure. Not only will this answer questions related to how ferritin interacts with inorganic materials, but this project would provide new understandings of the general interactions biological materials have with inorganic particles and surfaces. This would represent the first time many of these interactions have been directly visualized at this level of detail, both in terms of time resolution and spatial resolution.

"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY

This award supports theoretical and computational research, and education on defects in liquid crystals.
Liquid crystals are made of rod like molecules that display complex spatial arrangements, though intermediate between perfectly ordered crystals and completely disordered liquids.  Their combined ability to flow like a fluid, while transmitting directional forces and possessing direction dependent properties like a crystal, make them suitable for a wide range of applications. However, because of their weak crystallinity, defects are abundant in laboratory samples. Although this property has long been considered deleterious for applications, recent research has uncovered a host of new and unexpected properties of these materials that follow precisely from the existence of defects, and from their manipulation. Examples include guided transport of other molecular species or biological agents, the development of mechanical switches activated by light or electric fields, and even analogies involving biological response. This project is aimed to improve existing theoretical models that describe defected liquid crystals, and any accompanying transport. New models detailing the structure and motion of defects will be developed, including their interaction with transport of mass or fluid flow. The aim is to develop a predictive framework that describes the response of the liquid crystal to operating conditions or external influences. The specific focus of the research is on lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals, substances in which the liquid crystalline behavior is induced by using an appropriate dilution solvent to change the concentration of the rod like molecules. They have been known for a long time as dyes (including food dyes), and are analogs of lung surfactant agents. They are also bio-compatible liquid crystals, and are currently being developed for live cell steering or sorting. This class of liquid crystals features unusually large defect features that make them amenable to optical analysis, and comparison to theory.
The research will be used to further develop and enhance an interdisciplinary course on computation in the physical sciences. Students participating in the project will benefit from substantial training and collaboration opportunities at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute.


TECHNICAL SUMMARY

This award supports theoretical and computational research, and education focused on the systematic study of topological defects, equilibrium morphologies, and dynamical evolution of nematic-isotropic interfaces in lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals. Configurations considered include a pure nematic phase, or the biphasic region of coexistence between nematic and isotropic phases. This study is motivated by ongoing experiments that show that the characteristic microscopic scale of chromonics is on the order of microns, much larger than the 10 nm size in conventional thermotropic liquid crystals. Such large scales allow modern optical imaging techniques to resolve defect cores and two-phase interfaces, and hence to extract the parameters of mesoscopic free energy models down to an unprecedented spatial scale. This information opens the door to critical and quantitative tests of current nonlinear, gradient theories of nonequilibrium for nematics. In addition, the unusual morphology of nematic domains (tactoids), and their nonequilibrium evolution,  are expected to lead to novel behavior due to the complexity of interactions at this scale, including strong anisotropy, nonlocal elastic interactions due to topological defects, and mesocale biaxiality.  Defect driven flows and the dynamics of biological matter suspended in the chromonic are among planned investigations. These are under active scrutiny because of potential applications in flow control in microfluidics and optobiological devices, in the biomedical field for cell sorting and bio sensing.
The research will be used to further develop and enhance an interdisciplinary course on computation in the physical sciences. Students participating in the project will benefit from substantial training and collaboration opportunities at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute.

"Nontechnical:

Moore’s Law is famously known for projecting an increase in computing performance, with the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubling every two years. As the size of transistors approaches the ultimate limits, new concepts are needed for performance breakthroughs. Molecular electronics aims at developing devices that will complement and eventually supersede current semiconductor technologies. Molecular transport junctions have unique advantages, due to their hybrid solid state-molecular nature and novel interface properties. The variety of possible combinations of molecules and electrodes also permits tailoring the transport properties. Electrically gating charge transport was key to the electronics revolution, but no mechanism currently exists to effectively gate molecular transport junctions. This project will address that gap through a systematic probe of the factors related to electric transport. This will improve the fundamental understanding of these novel devices and enable a new gating mechanism to control electric transport with an unprecedented level of control. This will allow for integration of specific functions into molecular junctions that will enable practical applications. These include bio-photonics and optoelectronic device such as solar cells and LEDs at the single molecule level. This project will train for undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary nanotechnologies that span physics, chemistry and engineering. An introductory course in nanoelectronics will be updated to include the new materials from the project. The PIs will recruit students of different scientific, ethnic, and nationality backgrounds to study science and engineering to foster our next generation scientists and engineers through this project. Students can also participate in related university programs, such as Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP), UGA-Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority participation (LSAMP) Program, and the Nanotechnology and Biomedicine REU Site.

Technical:

This project aims to develop enabling technologies that allow for integration of our recently developed and patented MTBJ systems with optics to probe and control opto-electronic transport in biased single molecule MTBJs through three tasks. The PIs will develop a measuring platform by integrating optical designs into our patented SPM MTBJs that allow the molecule to connect covalently to two electrodes with linker groups, which enables the controlling of the molecule-electrode coupling and aligning the orbitals of conjugated molecules away from the electrodes. Then, they will conduct a systematic study to measure photoconductance where charge carriers in the MTBJs are excited by radiation energy HOMO to LUMO and by the surface plasmons and determine the effect of molecule-electrode contact and molecular conformation on the carrier injection barrier and photon-induced electronic conduction properties. Finally, they will demonstrate a viable single molecule field-effect Raman scattering (FERS) device, a double gated single molecule MTBJ device, with a second electrochemical gating added to the plasma gating. This project will establish a revolutionary new approach using double gating to effectively gate the electrical transport in MTBJs device by exploring the origins of the most important interactions, such as photon-electron, molecule-electrode interactions, being studied in molecular electronics today. The proposed studies are imperative to advancing research in single molecule devices by providing not only the basic knowledge but also necessary skills to develop novel applications. It will also lead to new insights into the interplay between electron transfer and optical properties in single molecule devices, which is critical to many areas, such as photosynthesis and bio-photonics.

"Paper-based electronics and sensors (i.e., Papertronics) are emerging technologies providing a new platform for a wide range of applications for healthcare, environment monitoring, display, and energy storage. Paper as a substrate for next-generation electronics holds significant potential because of its physical and chemical characteristics, including a high surface area to volume ratio, porous structure, biocompatibility, biodegradability, low-cost worldwide availability, foldability, and lightweight. However, the mechanical properties limit intimate integration and conformal contact with living organ systems because the paper is easy to tear and not stretchable. To advance papertronics into bio-integrated soft bioelectronics, paper’s mechanical properties will be modified to make it stretchable while keeping the fibrous structure with bioinert chemical properties to take full advantage of paper’s intrinsic characteristics. The stretchable paper, new material and platform, will be the foundations of the next generation of the papertronics and paperfluidics. Indeed, the stretchable paper can transform into a new domain of interdisciplinary studies putting together basic material science research and engineering sciences to establish groundbreaking innovations. The systematically studied fabrication parameters will accelerate the development of advanced manufacturing, especially in flexible hybrid electronics, and further will be transformed into the production process for use by industry. Knowledge will be disseminated through the development of an educational workshop for STEM teachers, peer-reviewed publications, classroom teaching, student mentoring, and full participation of minorities, women, and underrepresented groups.

The proposed project aims to revolutionize paper-based electronics by creating advances in the stretchable co-axial nonwoven fibrous mat using electrospinning technologies. The stretchable papers consist of thin, soft, and core-sheath fibrous platform that will allow becoming elastic but maintaining chemical properties of the paper while using silicone elastomer and cellulose for core material and outer sheath polymer, respectively. Our project involves three objectives to investigate stretchable papertronics. The specific aims are as follows: (1) the thin, nanomesh cellulose coated elastomeric silicone-based polymer substrates will be investigated for mechanically, and biochemically compatible bioelectronics; (2) the stretchable paper will be characterized its physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. The relationship between the fiber diameter and core (or sheath) thickness with processing parameters will be systematically studied. Additionally, the compatibility to the conventional printing technologies will be tested to develop the stretchable paper into functional electronics.; (3) the elastomeric paper-based microbial fuel cell (MFC) will be demonstrated as model papertronics. The 3D cellulose-coated PDMS nanofibers will serve as a substrate for MFC, which generates power for soft bioelectronics with conformal contact with the organ system. Overall, the study of the paper-based electronics validated with the stretchable paper will offer a comprehensive understanding of future developments in the biomechanically compatible papertronics and paperfluidics for inflammatory-free, long-term biomedical applications as well as the environment- and cost-friendly solutions in manufacturing and disposal engineering.

"Part 1: 
As global concerns over the environmental impacts of plastic waste continue to grow, new solutions for providing sustainable materials are desperately needed, along with globally-minded scientists and engineers to deliver them.  This IRES Track I project seeks to develop such solutions while exploring new frontiers of biobased plastics and materials and training the next generation of innovative problem solvers.  Through the proposed program, U.S. graduate and undergraduate students from at Arizona State University (ASU) and Navajo Technical University (NTU) will travel to and participate in hands-on research projects in the Department of Biobased Materials at Kyoto Institute of Technology (KIT) in Kyoto, Japan.  For 10 weeks each Summer, this project will provide training opportunities for 3 graduate and 6 undergraduate student participants; or 9 and 18 total participants, respectively, over the duration of the 3-year project.  Students will be embedded into the labs of KIT faculty, collaborating and working closely with them and their students.  By engaging students in a series of meaningful research experiences, this project seeks to spark and/or further cultivate their interest in biotechnology, materials science, and sustainability, while strengthening their enthusiasm for advanced studies and careers in STEM disciplines.  Through partnership with NTU, along with a conscientious overall recruitment strategy, this project will also provide important STEM research opportunities for students from under-represented groups.  In addition to impactful research experiences, tours of industrial sites and government research facilities will be offered to improve  the professional preparation of students and their understanding of future career opportunities in this field. Student participants will also take part in a series of unique cultural activities.  Ultimately, by offering this project internationally at a university with world-class faculty and research facilities and in a city with unparalleled cultural amenities, this  program will also help to strengthen student identities as members of a global scientific community, while impressing upon them the importance of collaboration for providing solutions to complex global problems.  By enhancing the production of bioplastics, outcomes of this project offer the promise to reduce dependence on non-renewable oil and natural gas as well as, in many cases, the potential to positively impact the carbon cycle by consuming atmospheric CO2, a greenhouse gas.  

Part 2: 
The goals of the specific projects to be offered via this program span the continuum of relevant research challenges facing the production of biobased plastics and materials, including from upstream conversion, to polymer synthesis and materials development, to characterization of the resulting products, to their ultimate biodegradation.  Students in the program will receive comprehensive training in one or more the following areas: i) applied microbiology and bioprocess engineering to enhance the availability of diverse, bio-derived monomers; ii) polymer chemistry and engineering for producing new bioplastics from bio-derived monomers; iii) engineering of novel fibers and materials from diverse sources (e.g., bamboo and silk) and for various applications; iv) synthesis and characterization of novel, functionalized biomaterials for biomedical applications; v) development of new analytical techniques for high-throughput screening of novel monomers and nanostructural characterization of biobased materials and plastics; and vi) investigation of sustainable methods for bioplastic degradation.  This program will also provide numerous opportunities for direct engagement between faculty members across schools, enabling it to serve as an effective platform for fostering long-term, multi-disciplinary research collaborations between institutions.  Ultimately, enhanced bioplastics production offers the promise to reduce dependence on non-renewable oil and natural gas while positively impacting the carbon cycle by consuming atmospheric CO2.

The goal of the proposed research is to investigate the fluid dynamics mechanisms that can lead to sleep apnea and to develop fluid dynamics-based strategies for intervention. The importance of understanding the reasons for this condition at a fundamental level is very significant, since this condition that can sometimes result in deaths.

The goal of the proposed research is to advance the fundamental knowledge of biological fluid dynamics in prediction and control of human snoring through a combined physiology-based modeling, physics-based simulation, analysis, verification, and optimization approach. This approach is also applicable to a wide range of engineering and biological systems, such as noise reduction and phonation. There are mainly two objectives: (1) to develop a methodology for unveiling the flow physics and sound-producing mechanism of biological fluid-structure coupling problems and (2) to use the methodology for the investigation of optimal intervention procedures in order to ease the vortex-induced snore symptoms towards a better quality of life. The proposed work is highly interdisciplinary and involves fundamental scientific problems in the fields of biology, physics, physiology, and engineering. Snoring is an audible sign coded with richness of information about human respiratory functions. The sound comes from a complex interaction between compliant airway structures and the transient vortex shedding which is induced by the narrowing of the airway passage. However, the specific snore source mechanisms are still elusive, despite the significant in vitro and clinical efforts. Physics-based numerical investigation of the snore source will promise to quantify the relationship between the nonlinear response of the flexible airways and the respiratory vortex dynamics for sound generation. Currently, snore source diagnosis relies on expensive and time-consuming procedures that are outsourced to special analytical laboratories. Such challenges in performing in vivo and in vitro snore diagnosis will make the numerical methods ideal investigative tools. The PIs propose to systematically study the snore-producing mechanisms of different age and gender groups, paying particular attention to the underlying physics of biological fluid-structure interaction and associated sound sources. This is to be accomplished through the use of a combined modeling, simulation, analysis, validation, and optimization approach. The findings from the proposed research could provide pre-surgical guidelines for alleviating the apnea-causing factors by minimizing sound production of the system. Findings from this work could be used by acoustic experts and respiratory therapists for understanding the sound source production and control from its biological origin. The theories developed from this research will promote accurate diagnosis of snore sources and effective treatment of patients with snoring or other respiratory disorders. The research work will also be the central theme in a multi-level education program in which: (1) PIs will continue to provide summer undergraduate research experience to attract and retain engineering students from under-represented groups; (2) the proposed methodology will be incorporated into the PIs' existing graduate level course on bio-inspired flow and respiratory aerosol dynamics; and (3) an educational lab curriculum in snore specialty will be developed to provide multi-disciplinary training and research opportunities for high-school and college students and to support biomedical and bio-inspired engineering programs in both University of Virginia and Central Michigan University","Lowell","University of Massachusetts Lowell","47.041","89225","FD-Fluid Dynamics","2001090","xi1j@cmich.edu","Jinxiang","XI","10/22/2019","09/01/2019","12/31/2020","Collaborative Research: Fluid Dynamics-based analysis towards control of sleep apnea","BIO"
"Shifting society's dependence on petroleum-based fuels and chemicals to biomass derived products is important not only to reduce our carbon usage but also to increase the robustness of our energy security and economic stability. To that end, the environmentally benign reuse or upgrading of materials considered byproducts of industrial and agricultural economies is one of the ultimate goals of sustainable practices. Lignin, as the most abundant aromatic polymers in nature, provides structural strength and protection against microbial/enzymatic degradation of plants. It is available in quantity of over 100 million dry tons as a waste stream from paper and pulping industry. Despite its great potential as a feedstock for making a wide range of chemicals, lignin is still an underutilized substrate. Under the current bio-refinery concept, lignin is commonly burned to generate steam and electricity. Converting lignin waste streams to high value-added chemicals and materials is critical for the economic viability and success of a bio-refinery industry. The successful demonstration of the proposed work will provide a novel biocatalysis route for valorizing lignin from relevant waste streams to high value commodity and specialty chemicals, greatly reducing barriers along the biofuels supply chain.  This project will also integrate outreach and education activities for underprivileged groups from the Appalachian region in STEM fields.

Two key challenges hindering effective lignin conversion are to improve the contact of the bulky poorly soluble lignin polymer to the catalyst and the selective/controlled breakdown of inter-unit linkages. Elucidating the interactions of lignolytic enzyme with ionic liquid (IL) will allow a more rational approach to synthesize better ILs and the ability to reengineer better enzymes to optimize their activities in aqueous IL solution. This EPSCoR Research Fellowship provides a unique opportunity for the PI to visit and collaborate with the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) at the Department of Energy (DOE)'s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The overarching goal is to explore IL-enzyme interfaces through extended visits to EMSL by accessing the nation's premier scientific user facilities and build on efforts to develop innovative biocatalysis pathways to convert lignin to high value chemicals. The research will involve: 1) mechanistic understanding of lignin solubility, selective lignin depolymerization and enzyme compatibility with aqueous ILs; 2) exploration of new IL-lignolytic enzyme pairs via advanced EPR/NMR, bioimaging, spectrophotometry and computational chemistry capacities at EMSL to probe interfacial interactions between IL-enzyme-lignin. A better understanding of such interactions will guide our future research to design new biocompatible ILs, engineer better enzymes via directed evolution/modifying surface charges, or explore new membrane/catalyst interfaces, to further improve product yield and selectivity.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a tool to non-invasively measure inflammatory markers, microbes and metabolic profiles inside the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract for a variety of medical conditions. Initially, the device can be used for the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This device and the data it collects will be used to improve the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders, such as type II diabetes, that cumulatively cost the US economy over $200 billion per year. Given the centrality of gut physiology to human health, there will likely be additional uses of the technology in monitoring human health, eventually making it as routine and informative as a blood test is today in the practice of medicine.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will deliver a pill-sized device to the distal small intestine region of the human GI tract and trigger the collection of the luminal contents in that region.  The device will need to accommodate tremendous variation in the physiology of the human gut. The sampling device will encounter a biochemical environment ranging from pH 1 to pH 8. The time required for normal peristalsis to deliver the sampling device to the desired region of the GI tract will vary from 3 to 10 hours. Furthermore, cost and safety constraints strongly favor the use of a passive device with no actively powered sensors or actuators. A multidisciplinary approach using mechanical and material science innovations can meet these challenges and make the proposed device a platform sampling technology for IBD, and GI disorders in general.

"The marine carbon and oxygen cycles are intimately linked through the production and consumption of oxygen during photosynthesis and respiration. The amount of oxygen consumed per mole of respired organic carbon, the respiration quotient, is key for accurately predicting ocean oxygen concentrations and how ocean oxygen levels will respond to climate change. Despite this importance, the respiration quotient has rarely been measured directly. The aim of this research is to estimate the respiration quotient and its variability across ocean regions and depth. This will be done through an integration of direct chemical measurements of particulate organic matter collected from multiple ocean regions and indirectly by using an ocean circulation model to analyze a global database of dissolved oxygen and carbon concentration with a circulation model. In addition to advancing the understanding of the ocean oxygen cycle in the scientific community, this project will provide research training for researchers and students. The project will also improve awareness and understanding in the general public about possible future changes to marine oxygen concentrations.

One of the main uncertainties in predicting current and future oxygen levels is the regulation of the biological respiration demand. The respiration quotient describes the amount of oxygen needed during the consumption of one mole of organic carbon and thus is a key link between the carbon and oxygen cycles. Here, we propose to measure the amount of oxygen consumed per mole of respired organic carbon, the respiration quotient, in particulate organic matter (POM) from the surface and thermocline using a newly developed chemical technique. Thus, we aim to obtain new direct chemical measurements of the respiration quotient across distinct oceanic regimes and depths. Subsequently, we propose to incorporate these observations into a seasonally-resolved inverse model using global hydrographic tracer concentration data. This combined approach will provide the first global-scale estimates (and uncertainties) of the mean and regional variability of the respiration quotient in the POM stock and export flux. Different parameterizations linking the respiration quotient to regions or environmental variables will be applied to test how they impact and replicate global oxygen concentrations and the extent of the oxygen minimum zones.

"This award will fund for a workshop for the development of technologist for surveillance and diagnosis of pathogens; it will be held at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, MD in March, 2020. The workshop will bring togther experts in infectious disease modeling, technology innovation, surveillance, control, and public health policy over a period of two days to identify needs and opportunities in this area. Emerging infectious diseases pose an increasing risk to humans due to a growing world population, changes in climate and land use, and a highly connected global transport systems. Advances and accessibility to engineering technologies have increased the threat of accidental and deliberate harm from biological incidents. To mitigate these risks requires improved epidemic preparedness strategies, specifically infectious disease surveillance and control at the local, state and national levels. This workshop will bring together a range of disciplines to explore critical gaps in scientific and technological understanding: those that prevent the translation of current emerging technologies, as well as gaps in the community?s prioritization of basic research needed for future technological capabilities. The workshop will identify gaps in current approaches to surveillance methods and explore how these problems should be addressed with available emerging technologies. It will identify needs for new technologies. The results from the workshop will be used to guide the national research agenda and thus better target support mechanisms to i) aid the development and integration of new emerging technologies, and ii) ensure the translation of the technology to public health practitioners; both of which are critical steps to protect the population from the increased threat posed by infectious diseases.

"This doctoral dissertation project will examine the energetic cost of brown adipose tissue (BAT), a heat-producing tissue known to be activated under cold conditions, in 100 adults from a lower-latitude population. Research on BAT in adults has been relatively understudied, and this project will expand the available data and geographic scope for investigating BAT’s role in human heat production, energy allocation, and cold adaptation. The project will advance fundamental knowledge in human biology, and may also inform public health research on obesity and diabetes. In addition to the direct transmission of some data to study participants, project outcomes will be shared with the greater public through platforms such as social media, public talks, and publications in open-access journals. Furthermore, this study will foster research collaborations with local research assistants, who will develop STEM research skills and facilitate the smooth and culturally appropriate implementation of the project. 

BAT has been extensively studied in hibernating mammals and in human infants, but fewer studies have focused on its functions in adults. Researchers have suggested that BAT may have played a role in human evolution as an adaptive defense mechanism against chronic cold and that it may also be useful in reducing risks of metabolic diseases given its physiological effects on metabolism. In this study, BAT function will be examined in a lower-latitude population showing an average body size and shape that is morphologically best adapted to retain heat despite living in a warm region. BAT will be inferred by comparing metabolic rates and heat dissipation in the chest and shoulder area (main BAT location in adults) at room temperature and at mild cold exposure. Simultaneously, fasting glucose levels as well as respiratory quotients (a ratio determining metabolic substrates consumed) will be measured before and after BAT activation to determine BAT’s use of glucose. By determining the metabolic and heat-producing capabilities of BAT in the study population, this research will parse out how BAT may be a physiological reflection of cold adapted morphology and by extension how BAT may have played a role in the successful dispersal of humans into different ecological settings independent of their morphology. A better understanding of the energy consumption and glucose disposal of BAT can provide insight into its potential utility in weight gain and diabetes prevention. These potential health benefits of BAT activation are especially important for regions burdened by high rates of obesity and diabetes.

"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on addressing environmental challenges associated with extensive use of synthetic agrochemicals by developing novel sustainable nanoformulations for efficient management of bacterial and fungal pathogens. The broader impacts of this research and development effort are important on several levels; the sustainable agricultural treatments developed in this project could help protect natural resources, enhance security of the national food supply by reducing crop losses, and improve public health. While the initial focus is on efficient delivery of anti-microbial and anti-fungal crop protection chemicals, this platform can be applied for actives and biologicals with other functionalities. Thus, in addition to agricultural crop protection products, the environmentally benign nanoparticle delivery system developed in the project may find future applications in many products targeted to the consumer market, construction, personal care and healthcare.
 
This SBIR Phase II project will advance the development of a novel platform where engineered nanoparticles made from sustainable materials will replace harmful and persistent synthetic chemical agents used presently. The research objective is to utilize the widely available bio-renewable resource lignin as a natural non-persistent bio-degradable delivery system for agricultural actives. Colloidal particles made of technical lignin will be fabricated in large amounts by non-solvent precipitation in a continuous, green, low-cost method and then functionalized for stability and improved targeted attachment to the plant foliage. A multi-disciplinary approach is proposed to characterize thoroughly the new formulations and correlate their material characteristics and agronomic performance. This new knowledge will make possible to develop physico-chemical means of enhancing their field efficacy. In addition, research will focus on safety evaluation via human health risk assessment.

"With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program supports the group of Dr. Raphael M. Franzini from the University of Utah in a collaboration with Dr. Randall Peterson from the University of Utah to develop new chemistries to study and manipulate biomolecules in cells. Countless biological components are precisely orchestrated during cellular processes. One such process is the interaction of proteins with each other during cell signaling events. Studying these processes and events with high precision often requires activation of specific biological components at specific times during a measurement. One way to achieve this goal is to use chemical reactions. However, in order to be practical under typical biological conditions, such a chemical reaction needs to be completed in a few minutes. To obtain such short reaction times, the size of molecules involved in the reaction should be as small as possible to minimize their interference with the large biomolecules in the system. This award funds the development of new chemistries that meet these requirements and provides formal research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students toward becoming leaders in chemistry and biology. An integral part of the research program is the establishment of the Summer Experience Advancing Research in Chemical Biology (SEARCH) program that provides research and mentoring opportunities to encourage high school students to enter a career in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field. 

The research project explores the bioorthogonal chemistry of isocyanides to enable the rapid uncaging of molecules of interest in cells. The isocyano group is unique because although consisting of only two atoms it readily undergoes bioorthogonal reactions. The project advances isocyano-based groups that can be removed by exposure to tetrazines, which are another type of bioorthogonal moiety. Particular goals are to make the release reaction faster, the masking groups smaller, and to reduce the tetrazine concentration needed for the reaction to occur. The chemistry is used to study the activity of proprotein convertases during the early embryogenesis of zebrafish with spatial and temporal resolution.

"With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Robert Waymouth of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University and Dr. James Hedrick of IBM Almaden Laboratories to develop and explore new catalysts and catalytic methods for the generation of biodegradable, functional, and responsive polymers.  These polymers (large molecules containing many monomer units linked together with chemical bonds) are targeted as alternatives to petrochemically-derived plastics and as new families of biodegradable materials for biomedical applications.  The central focus is on the design and characterization of environmentally-benign, metal-free catalysts that enable optimum polymer production under large scale industrial conditions.  Functional properties such as degradability and biocompatibility of the polymers generated using these methods are also investigated.  The project effectively fosters academic and industrial collaboration on both scientific research and training of students.  The collaboration improves academic-industrial interactions, which can have a very positive educational impact on students and young researchers who are rarely educated about the ways to efficiently transfer laboratory-generated knowledge into the industrial realm.  This project has the potential to advance new strategies in polymer synthesis and create new technologies for the next generation of renewable plastics.  

The academic-industrial team of Waymouth and Hedrick develops new automated continuous flow reactors designed to function optimally under a variety of polymerization conditions.  They design new catalyst families based on squaramides and indole carboxamides and related structures.  The team invents “catalyst switch” strategies relying on rate differences associated with proton transfer to enable the scalable and reproducible generation of block copolymer libraries in ring-opening polymerization of polyesters and polycarbonates.  They also integrate catalytic strategies for both the synthesis of functional monomers and the macromolecules resulting from their enchainment.  Emphasis is placed on detailed mechanistic and theoretical investigations to illuminate the mechanistic details of organocatalytic polymerization reactions.  Degradation pathways associated with bio-mimicking poly(alpha-amino esters) in aqueous media are also investigated.  The organocatalytic platform associated with this award is spawning innovative technologies for the generation of bio-active polymers and oligomers that can be applied as anti-microbial agents, cell-transfection agents for the delivery of drugs, fluorescent and luminescent probes and genetic agents.

"A class of bacteria called methanotrophs can convert methane to other compounds. Methane is the principle component of natural gas and a byproduct of oil drilling. It is also a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The removal of methane from the atmosphere has an important role to play in maintaining our environment. Methanotrophs could also be modified to produce valuable products. This project is designed to identify the best way to modify methanotroph metabolism to produce fuels and products from methane. This project will also engage undergraduates in research. In addition, hands-on activities to enhance science literacy will be developed and delivered to a local elementary school, preparing them for STEM careers.
 

Methanotrophs have great potential for both control of methane emissions and methane valorization. Their metabolism is strongly affected by a number of environmental parameters, especially the bioavailability of copper and rare earth elements. These metals control the activity of key enzymes involved in methane transformation.  A fundamental, mechanistic understanding how these metals affect methanotrophic physiology and gene expression must be developed.  In this project, a suite of molecular and modeling techniques will be pursued to delineate how these metals control methanotrophic metabolism, and then targeted genes will be knocked out/knocked in to enhance the re-direction of carbon to desired end products, e.g., poly-hydroxyalkanoates (for bioplastic production) and methanol (for biofuel production).  Thus, the overall goal of this project is to measure and model the transcriptome/metabolome of methanotrophs to develop lucrative strategies for methane capture and valorization.

"A significant challenge in treating some aggressive cancers and neurological diseases is the lack of understanding regarding the spatial-temporal molecular heterogeneity of the diseased tissue/organ. Molecular characteristics and interaction vary significantly across different spatial sub-units of the tissue/organ. The spatial pattern also changes over time as the disease progresses. The capability of mapping out the spatial-temporal patterns of molecular biomarkers is instrumental for elucidating the biological underpinning of disease formation, progression, and treatment resistance. This mapping, however, is extremely challenging, because it would require dense sampling of the diseased tissue/organ of a living person by highly invasive biopsy, which is infeasible. In reality, only a few samples can be taken, leaving a vast amount of unknown blank regions. On the other hand, recent years have witnessed the rapid advances of biomedical imaging technologies, which create structural and functional images of various modalities. Multimodality images can be taken non-invasively and for the entire diseased tissue/organ; importantly, they provide a complementary phenotypic presentation of underlying molecular characteristics. This creates an unprecedented opportunity to generate inverse-estimates of the underlying spatial-temporal molecular characteristics from the images to fill in the ""blank regions."" Once achieved, such inverse-estimates would help decipher the complex biological system of the diseased tissue/organ and inform new effective treatments with unparalleled precision adapted to spatial-temporal molecular heterogeneity.  

The objective of this project is to develop a suite of new statistical models for inverse mapping/estimation of the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of molecular biomarkers from multimodality image phenotype. The investigators propose a novel modeling framework that integrates data-driven and biological-principle-driven mechanistic models, and meanwhile fuses global-scale image data and sparsely-sampled local biopsy measurements. This framework embraces modeling approaches to characterize both spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of the disease. Furthermore, to account for patient similarity and specificity, the investigators propose a robust transfer learning model for integrating each patient?s data with information selectively transferred from other patients to avoid the negative transfer. Also, the project tackles joint modeling of a biomarker panel for characterizing spatial-temporal biomarker interaction. The proposed models will be validated in two applications: glioblastoma and Alzheimer's Disease. This project is expected to generate significant insight for unraveling the complex biological systems underlying these diseases and provide the groundwork for new treatment intervention. Additionally, the proposed modeling framework integrates statistical and bio-mechanistic models, which bridges two traditionally separate research fields together. The research team is committed to educating the next generation statisticians and biomedical researchers with cross-disciplinary skills, recruiting minority and women students, and disseminating research results in both statistical and bio/biomedical communities.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are demonstrating undeniable success and widespread adoption, but the problem of algorithmic bias has arisen.  Algorithmic bias occurs when AI systems produce unjust decisions.  This problem is made worse by the fact that AI systems are opaque and unfamiliar to most people.  Scientists and the public want to unlock the power of fast, intelligent computer systems, but they are understandably hesitant when they see these systems unfairly discriminate or simply make unexplained decisions.  This research will answer fundamental questions to assist in understanding the public's trust and mistrust of AI: How does the public feel about AI systems?  What do they think of the shapers of these systems?  And do these attitudes change as they gain experience with AI systems?

The aim of this research is to directly measure public opinion regarding artificial intelligence systems and scientists and test the hypothesis that exposure to interpretable AI will lead to more positive attitudes.  The integration of AI systems into decision-making processes previously the sole domain of human judgement is still a relatively novel phenomenon.  Public opinion is likely in a dynamic phase and measuring how public attitudes toward AI evolve over the next few years is crucially important.  Thus, this project will compile monthly composite measures of trust in AI systems and scientists through surveying a representative sample of the US population.  Additionally, it is the case that much effort is currently being expended to make AI systems more interpretable.  This effort is predicated on the untested assumption that negative attitudes toward AI are due to the complex and opaque nature of its underlying algorithms.  The investigators will test the effect of firsthand experience with AI systems while experimentally controlling the level of transparency.  The goal is an explicit test of the theory that increased exposure to interpretable AI will decrease distrust and other negative attitudes toward AI.  With this research, the investigators will measure and test a method to mitigate mistrust of AI and advance the conversation currently taking place across social science and engineering disciplines regarding how humanity shall relate to a powerful new tool.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for big data analytics are becoming very important. However, AI software algorithms are computation resource intensive which imposes limitations on their practical applications as the currently available data processors are not well-suited for these needs. For example, training algorithms for AI can take several hours to days for completing the training process. Additionally, some of the other challenges, such as the requirement for huge training datasets, lack of real-time training and multi-modal data fusion capabilities, and limitations for the system to make decisions reliably with limited input data are well-recognized. Many of these problems can be addressed if brain-inspired neuromorphic data processors can be developed. However, it is a non-trivial task because of two primary reasons. First, the cortical circuits in brain is not fully understood and still is a topic of research in the neuroscience community. Second, artificial neuromimetic components for integration in brain-inspired architectures are not yet developed to match the computational efficiency and diversity of biological-brains.  It has been identified from current understanding of cortical circuits in biological-brain that a synapse which is a reconfigurable connection between neurons, play pivotal a role in learning and memory formation. The focus of this project is to develop artificial nanoelectronic synaptic devices that can be integrated in neuromorphic architectures. The project provides significant opportunities for training graduate and undergraduate students in understanding and developing neuromorphic processors for AI. A new course on ""Neuromorphic Computers for AI"" at the graduate level will be developed. Efforts will be made to increase participation of underrepresented groups in STEM by leveraging the program on ""Nurturing Educational Readiness and Development from the Start (NERDS)"" and through local Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) chapter.  

The nanoelectronic synaptic device will be developed by exploiting time-dependent trap dynamics in oxides in conjunction with the transport of intrinsic or extrinsic dopants in a novel gated-Synaptic Memory Device (gated-SMD) configuration. These dynamics will result in an analog potentiation (increase in conductance) and depression (decrease in conductance) as a function of the temporal sequences of voltage-pulses on gate that can be explored for implementing bio-inspired learning algorithms. The objective of the proposed research will be achieved by executing the following specific aims: (1) fabricating gated-SMDs and studying the device characteristics, including potentiation and depression of resistive states on different time-scales as a function of gate-bias and modeling it; (2) understanding the scalability of these devices by large-scale layout designs and comparing and benchmarking the cell sizes against other candidate memory technologies; and (3) developing  novel real-time learning algorithms and implementing bio-inspired learning schemes using gated-SMDs for neuromorphic architectures. The intellectual significance of the proposed research lies in knowledge base and a device platform to provide a solution of nanoelectronic synapses for neuromorphic circuits. If successful, the project will yield the following outcomes: (i) a fundamental understanding of gated-SMDs and device models benchmarked against experimental data, (ii) strategies to control potentiation and depression rates of resistive states in gated-SMD by engineering the device parameters, (iii) real-time learning algorithms tailored for gated-SMDs, and (iv) large-scale integration routes for gated-SMDs and scalability data. The achievement of these outcomes will have transformative impact on developing neuromorphic data processors for AI.

"Bio-oils are obtained from the fast pyrolysis of biomass, and their conversion into fuels and chemicals represents a sustainable alternative to coal, natural gas, and petroleum sources.  The critical step in upgrading bio-oil is the selective removal of oxygen atoms from the lignin-derived fraction under ambient pressures of hydrogen and in the presence of a catalyst (otherwise known as ""hydrodeoxygenation"").  The ideal catalyst for hydrodeoxygenation would be abundant, inexpensive and easy to handle, while also being active, selective, hydrogen efficient, stable, and regenerable. The goal of this research project is to develop a molecular-level understanding of the chemical and physical processes occurring during the hydrodeoxygenation of biomass-derived model compounds over a class of catalysts called reducible metal oxides.  Primarily, the studies will focus on cerium oxide (ceria), a material widely used commercially as an oxygen storage component in automotive exhaust systems.  The research project serves as a training ground for graduate and undergraduate students to perform cutting edge research.  The researchers also will participate in outreach activities in the Houston area, including Energy Day and Chevron Girls Engineering the Future Day, and they will host high school students in the laboratory and provide them with hands-on research experience as part of Project ACS SEED.

The fact that bulk ceria selectively cleaves carbon-oxygen bonds in biomass-derived model compounds raises interesting fundamental questions regarding the nature and density of oxygen vacancies in reducible metal oxides.  The precise mechanism through which carbon-oxygen bond cleavage over ceria occurs will be studied via four experimental steps: (1) demonstration of the potential of bulk ceria as a hydrodeoxygenation catalyst; (2) elucidation of the mechanism of anisole hydrodeoxygenation over bulk ceria; (3) establishing the active site requirements for hydrodeoxygenation over cerium oxide; and (4) understanding the effect of doping on active site identity, density, and efficacy.  This research project aims to optimize energy, cost, and atom-efficiency of biomass conversion processes by guiding the design of hydrodeoxygenation catalysts and clarifying the identity of the mechanistic steps involved in Mars-van Krevelen/reverse Mars-van Krevelen redox cycles, ubiquitous in the realm of bulk oxide catalysis.

"Cameras are pervasively used for surveillance and monitoring applications and can capture a substantial amount of image data. The processing of this data, however, is either performed a posteriori or at powerful backend servers. While a posteriori and non-real-time video analysis may be sufficient for certain groups of applications, it does not suffice for applications such as autonomous navigation in complex environments, or hyper spectral image analysis using cameras on drones, that require near real-time video and image analysis, sometimes under SWAP (Size Weight and Power) constraints. 

This work hypothesizes that future data challenges in real-time imaging can be overcome by pushing computation into the image sensor. Such systems will exploit the massive parallel nature of sensor arrays to reduce the amount of data analyzed at the processing unit. To this end, vertically integrated technology, such as focal plane sensor processors (FPSP), have been developed to overcome the limitations of conventional image processing systems. While some of these devices are programmable and offer the benefits of close-to-sensor processing such as performance and bandwidth reduction, they exhibit many drawbacks. For instance, each column of pixels is handled by a single processor, which reduces the parallelism and all pixels are treated equally and processed at the same rate, despite differences in input relevance for the application at hand. Consequently, systems spend more time spinning on non-relevant data, which increases sensing and computation time and power consumption. Research on FPSPs has mostly focused on technology aspects with some proof of concepts. Architectural design approaches, that involve high-level synthesis with the goal of mapping applications to low-level architectures, have not gained a lot of attention.

To overcome the limitations of existing architectures, the goal of this research is the design of a highly parallel, hierarchical, reconfigurable and vertically-integrated 3D sensing-computing architecture (XPU), along with high-level synthesis methods for real-time, low-power video analysis. The architecture is composed of hierarchical intertwined planes, each of which consists of computational units called XPUs. The lowest-level plane processes pixels in parallel to determine low level shapes in an image while higher-level planes use outputs from low-level planes to infer global features in the image. The proposed architecture presents three novel contributions: a hierarchical, configurable architecture for parallel feature extraction in video streams, a machine learning based relevance-feedback method that adapts computational performance and resource usage to input data relevance, and a framework for converting sequential image processing algorithms to multiple layers of parallel computational processing units in the sensor. 

The results of this projects can be used in other fields, where large amounts of processing need to be performed on data collected by generic sensors deployed in the field. Furthermore, mechanisms for translating sequential constructs into functionally equivalent accelerators using hardware constructs will lead to highly parallel and efficient sensing units that can perform domain specific tasks more efficiently.","Gainesville","University of Florida","47.070","273815","CSR-Computer Systems Research","1946088","cbobda@ufl.edu","Christophe","Bobda","08/16/2019","06/14/2019","10/31/2022","CSR: Small: Reconfigurable In-Sensor Architectures for High Speed and Low Power In-situ Image Analysis","BIO"
"Fishes are masters of locomotion in fluids owing to their highly integrated biological sensing, computing and motor systems. They are adept at collecting and exploiting rich information from the surrounding fluids for underwater sensing and locomotion control. Inspired and informed by fish swimming, this research aims to develop a novel bio-inspired cyber-physical system (CPS) that integrates the ?physical? robot fish and fluid environment with the ?cyber? robot control & machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this CPS system includes i) a pressure sensory skin with distributed sensing capability to collect flow information, ii) control and learning algorithms that compute robot motor signals, output by central pattern generators (CPGs) which receive pressure sensory feedback, iii) a robot fish platform to implement and validate the CPS framework for underwater sensing and control tasks, and iv) experimental and computational methods to investigate and model the underlying fluid physics. This CPS system will have immediate impacts on the core CPS research areas such as design, control, data analytics, autonomy, and real-time systems. It will also significantly impact a wide range of engineering applications which demand distributed sensing, control and adaptive actuation. Examples include human-machine interactions, medical robots, unmanned aerial/underwater vehicles, drug dosing, medical therapeutics, and space deployable structures among others. Leveraging the multidisciplinary nature of this research, this award will support a variety of educational and outreach activities. In particular, a list of activities in broadening participation in engineering will be carried out.

      This research project integrates multiple CPS technologies to develop bio-inspired technologies for swarm control of fish. These include inthanovations in a pressure sensitive skin  project will first develop a distributed pressure sensitive synthetic skin, which will be installed on robotic fishes to map the pressure distribution on their body and caudal-fin surfaces. The distributed pressure information will then be used in a feedback control policy that modulates CPGs to produce caudal-fin motion patterns of the robotic fishes. The control policy and the caudal-fin motion patterns will be optimized via reinforcement learning first in a surrogate fluid environment and then in the true fluid environment. The surrogate fluid environment will be developed using data-driven non-parametric models informed by physics-based hydrodynamic models of fish swimming, trained using combined experimental and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation data. The above control-learning methods will also be used to achieve efficient schooling in a group of robotic fishes, individually controlled by a CPG, which interacts with each other through surrounding fluids and pressure sensory feedback. The optimized swimming/schooling performance of robotic fishes and the underlying physics will be studied using CFD simulation. Together, this research will advance CPS knowledge on: 1) the design and creation of electronic and sensor materials and devices for robot skin applications; 2) the development of data-efficient, physics-informed learning methods for robotic systems that operate in complex environments, especially leveraging the recent progress on deep learning to exploit the spatial and temporal richness of the pressure data for underwater sensing and robot control; and 3) the flow physics and modeling of fish swimming.

"Microbial communities populate nearly all environments on our planet. These environments  include the human gut, the surface of corals in the oceans, and plant roots in the soil. In these communities, bacteria interact with each other to sustain environmental health. Understanding these interactions will reveal factors that establish robust, productive communities.  This project will focus on bacteria isolated from hot spring mats of Yellowstone National Park. A deeper understanding of the physical and metabolic conversations among bacteria that thrive in this extreme environment will be gained and used to model these interactions.

The PIs will also develop programs in partnership with local science museums and TV stations to encourage science literacy and community involvement. 
 
This project is focused on extremophile bacteria isolated from the hot spring mats of Yellowstone National Park. The approach will be to query the entire bacterial community within the mat as well as synthetic combinations of the bacteria grown under defined conditions in the laboratory. The application of sequencing and metabolomic technologies will reveal key metabolic pathways among members of the community under different light and nutrient conditions and over the diel cycle. The work will evaluate the hypothesis that microbial communities act like an integrated machine rather than as individual species grown under axenic conditions in the laboratory, and that this integration maintains functionalities critical for life in natural habitats. Experiments will also be performed to analyze how abrupt changes in light intensity, temperature and microbial composition impact mat growth, structure, electrical and metabolic networks.

"Nano- and micro-structures occur abundantly in both the natural world and in synthetic materials, and their technological role is growing rapidly.  The imaging of these small structures is difficult, as they are too small to see with the eye or ordinary optical microscope.  Electron microscopes, which employ electrons instead of light for imaging, can achieve the necessary magnifications.  With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program, the University of Massachusetts Amherst Electron Microscopy Center is acquiring a scanning electron microscope with three unique features: (i) no requirement for exposing specimens to high vacuum, (ii) mitigation of the charge usually accumulated during imaging, and (iii) an integrated microtome.  Amplifying on the latter, an integrated microtome allows serial sectioning of specimens as a means to gather a sequence of two-dimensional images that can be combined into a single, much more informative three-dimensional image.  The instrument is a shared resource supporting research and teaching across campus as well as at several nearby undergraduate colleges.  UMass Amherst has more than 50 vibrant funded research collaborations with U.S. companies, and many of these collaborations are being strengthened by the new capabilities to characterize specimens such as gels, emulsions, composites, adhesives, sensors, biological tissues, and individual cells.  The Center has a strong track record in producing highly skilled microscopists, and the new instrument plays a central role in innovative undergraduate and graduate laboratory courses that afford hands-on training in electron microscopy, an expertise offered at few institutions in the nation.

Technical Abstract
With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program, the University of Massachusetts Amherst Electron Microscopy Center is acquiring a Variable-Pressure Scanning Electron Microscope (VP-SEM) equipped with both a cryo-stage and a modular microtome for serial block-face imaging. The instrument operates at reduced pressure and provides gas injection for charge compensation, features that advance the imaging of insulating and/or solvated soft materials and life science specimens. In conjunction with advanced reconstruction software, the ultramicrotome will afford mapping in three-dimensions.  As a field emission SEM with an energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometer, an added capability is three-dimensional elemental mapping.  None of these capabilities was previously available in the Center.  Together the new capabilities boost research directed at diverse topics such as: particle dynamics and structuring on non-volatile and modestly volatile liquids; morphologies of solvated films, membranes, and gels; and cell protein localization and neuron mapping. These projects span the campus and beyond, and users come from 20 or more University of Massachusetts Amherst departments as well as from 7 to 10 nearby colleges.  Placed alongside an existing High-Resolution Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope and an Energy-Filtered Field Emission Transmission Electron Microscope, the VP-SEM complements a strong suite of electron microscopy capabilities, furthering numerous individual research projects while sparking cross-pollination of ideas between materials and life science researchers.  In addition to access through undergraduate and graduate courses, the VP-SEM will be available to users from collaborating U.S. companies, which number more than 50.  In conjunction with other NSF-supported research projects at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, attractive images are being provided to Ventures in Science Using Arts Laboratory (VISUAL), an outreach effort that places these images, along with a laymen's explanation, in high track public venues.

"Rapidly expanding machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms offer tools for Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), unprecedented just a few of years ago. Even the most advanced traditional tools today (microfluidics, advanced modeling, and supercomputers) cannot keep up with the opportunities offered by data intensive ML/AI tools. The main barrier to achieve the goals laid out in the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) strategic plan is the difficulty to access clean, curated, comprehensive, meaningful, and most of all, standardized data that can be used in predictive design and modeling of engineered systems, especially true in highly complex and dynamic interfaces between biology and materials science. The ability to deploy these powerful algorithms in domain sciences has remained limited due to the sheer number of dimensions of the parameter space and enormous variability in the data. With the goal of overcoming the current barriers, this project aims to develop a modular software framework, dubbed Materials Intelligence (Mat-I) towards accelerating discovery and innovation in MSE. By exploiting Mat-I technology, the scientific community has the high likelihood of accelerating research, and the collaborating industry (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, NVIDIA, Real Networks, Proctor and Gamble, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and Intel) will have the crucial tools to develop materials and methods with tailored bio-nano interfaces at the critical intersection of biology, solid-state systems, and informatics in designing devices such as bionanosensors for cancer diagnostics, biomolecular fuel cells for energy harvesting, and neuromorphic networks towards brain-like computers. The project will educate the next generation of innovative scientists, undergraduates, PhDs, and post-doctoral researchers, bolstering the traditional competitive edge of the US at the world stage.

The technical aim of the convergence science team, with expertise in genomics, computer science, physics, and materials science and engineering, is to construct a modular Mat-I software framework towards accelerating discovery and innovation. The research will generate and make accessible comprehensive maps among the input space of structures (peptides and single atomic layer solids, the smallest viable entities in biology and physical sciences, respectively) to the output target space of physical properties under a wide range of experimental conditions. The goal is to learn correlations among the three parameters such that, given the sequence/structure representations and experimental conditions, one can then predict the output physical properties, which may be adapted to complex engineered solutions. The proposed approach will employ, enhance, and develop specific mathematical, statistical, and information approaches for discovery in materials engineering that will combine physical, information, and biosciences. Given a set of measurements, the team will apply ML/AI to make inferences and learn a model of the true underlying process and, using these inferences and quantifications of uncertainty, the team will devise test-beds to maximize the information gained with respect to the model. By collecting data and making correlations in an iterative loop, the pace of discovery will be accelerated in closing the knowledge gaps faster than standard methods. The research will use model selection, robust statistics, and adaptive learning, and prototype validation in both static and dynamic representations of bio-nano interfaces. The project will establish foundational rules of a wide range of key wetware devices for technology and medicine through neural network formation by incorporating biology with solid-state devices of the future, the ultimate goal of the project.

"Sleep is a biological imperative for humans. Insufficient or disordered sleep increases daytime fatigue and sleepiness, decreases cognitive function. Unfortunately, there are numerous challenges associated with accurate sleep assessment. These include difficulties in making measurements without interfering with the sleep process, unique baseline characteristics for individuals, and cumbersome manual analysis of lengthy data sets. In the laboratory environment, Doppler radar technology has been demonstrated to provide a non-invasive means of measuring vital signs through clothing and bedding. We propose to develop a radar-based measurement system can be used to provide autonomous in-home measurement and analysis of sleep. The proposed effort will advance knowledge in smart radar technology measuring physiology, big data analytics for personalized medicine; and the understanding of sleep physiology. It will also support potential technological breakthroughs at their intersection, including new diagnostic techniques for smart connected health.

This project bridges fundamental research and sleep research together by exploring radar technology-based solutions for bio-medical and bio-behavioral sleep medicine research challenges. The proposed research will advance knowledge and understanding of Doppler radar physiological monitoring by introducing new transceiver architectures to accurately resolve requisite cross-section and displacement parameters while isolating one of two jointly sensed subjects, and new deep learning models integrating with physical models for recognition of apnea events and sleep disorders at personalized level. It will advance sleep medicine by introducing this non-contact tool that can extend patient monitoring to the home and provide patient-centered analysis. It will also support potential technological breakthroughs at their intersection, including new diagnostic techniques for smart connected health. The research poses a motivating educational opportunity that leverages the unique needs of Hawaiians for remote healthcare tools, and reaches out to a diverse population of ethnic minority students that have been historically under-served by local educational and industrial opportunities. Research outcomes will be integrated with education through training a new generation of engineers with the awareness of healthcare issues through courses (biomedical, sensors and informatics courses), undergraduate research projects, and K-12 STEM outreach activities.

"Technological advances have enabled researchers to determine the chemical composition (sequence) of millions of different proteins from thousands of organisms.  However, making use of this information in applications such as medicine and agriculture requires additional work to determine the functions of these proteins-what they do at the molecular and organism levels.  The first step in determining function of a new protein is to compare its sequence to other proteins whose functions have been analyzed experimentally.  Under previous funding,  computational methods for reconstructing the evolutionary history of each group of related proteins developed and this history was used to suggest functions that have been conserved during evolution and provide the starting point for protein function analysis. The next step in this work is to enable application to the millions of protein sequences available, and to extend the method to include more detailed information about protein function.  This project will develop and test a practical, production-grade implementation of our method, and apply it to UniProt, the world's largest database of protein sequences.  UniProt is publicly available, so results will be broadly available and usable by both scientists and non-scientists alike.  Educational materials will be developed to help make the results more accessible to students and non-scientists.

The UniProt protein knowledgebase aims to maximize the utility of protein sequence data to the scientific community by representing not only the sequences themselves, but also annotations: metadata describing information that can be inferred about those sequences, such as predicted protein function.  The current approach to large-scale annotation of UniProt, called UniRule, relies on ad hoc rules to define sets of proteins that should be annotated similarly.  While these rules implicitly utilize information about evolutionary relationships (e.g. membership in a protein family), they do not model function evolution explicitly and are therefore limited in the specificity of annotations they can express.  This project implements an explicit evolutionary approach to large-scale sequence annotation, building upon previous work 1) on evolutionary modeling of gain and loss of protein functions (represented as terms from the Gene Ontology) in gene families, and 2) on software to reconstruct the evolutionary history any arbitrary protein sequence by placing it in the context of a phylogenetic tree. Production-level implementation of this approach within the UniProt resource will integrate the large-scale annotation systems already used in the UniProt and Gene Ontology projects, and result in increased specificity and coverage of annotations in the UniProt knowledgebase. The project will significantly improve annotations on tens of millions of sequences in the UniProt knowledgebase, impacting the massive UniProt user base. It will also provide the annotations for Gene Ontology-based analyses of the large number of fully sequenced genomes in UniProt, making such analyses more broadly available.  A new online educational module for protein function evolution will curate a learning path starting with this module and including other available online modules.  The results will be available in the UniProt resource (uniprot.org), and all software and annotation metadata will be available at pantree.org.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable the development of alternatives to petrochemicals can be economically produced. The core technology is a process for the conversion of lignin to value-added, sustainable chemical products with a focus on high-performance materials. The commercialization of this technology will potentially result in a significant reduction in the environmental impact of plastic production. The development will also unlock a new and sustainable revenue stream for the pulp & paper industry, enabling new organic growth as the paper market continues to shrink. Additionally, value-added products from lignin will potentially allow the biorefining industry to be cost-competitive with petrochemicals as the market for chemical alternatives grows.

This I-Corps project is centered around converting lignin, the structural component of woody biomass, into cost-competitive, value-added chemicals and materials via catalytic depolymerization. Lignin is currently considered a waste stream by the pulp & paper and biorefining industries, with more than 98% of the 70 million tons separated annually being burned for energy recovery. Other low-value uses for lignin include fillers for concrete, asphalt, and tire rubber, and moderate-value applications include polymer composites and chemicals from pyrolysis. The depolymerization technology at the core of this proposal breaks down lignin to yield platform chemicals, with the key advantage over other technologies being the product selectivity. The chemical products have wide-ranging applications in adhesives, coatings, and many other polymers applications and are often performance-advantaged with respect to thermal and mechanical properties and other materials characteristics.

"The NanoFabrication Facility at the Advanced Science Research Center at the City University of New York is an interdisciplinary research space which is home to a diverse community of researchers who conduct work in the fields of nano-electronics, photonics, nano-bio interfaces, and several other fields enabled by nanofabrication. A key challenge, which is addressed by the purchase of a high throughput, large area electron beam lithography system is the ability to quickly and reliably generate patterns across multiple length scales: from tens of nanometers to several centimeters in size. In doing so, the system will accelerate research and enable the researchers to rapidly and cost effectively prototype electronic, photonic, and other devices which will serve as the basis of future technologies. Furthermore, the laboratory is a NYC based hub for mentoring high school, undergraduate, graduate students, and early career researchers. This system will be used to prepare students to tackle the complex problems facing the U.S., the STEM research community, and the world. In the long term, significant societal impact is anticipated in the development of fundamentally new technologies for health technologies, environmental science and energy generation.


Electron beam lithography is a direct write / maskless lithographic technique used to rapidly generate patterns with nanometer resolution. In the past decade a large number of new material systems, such as two and three dimensional topological insulators, graphene, and transition metal dichalcogenides and many others emerged with the promise of revolutionizing the fields of photonics, nanoelectronics, and nano-bio interfaces. If successfully implemented, devices made from these materials include high mobility field effect transistors, topological and gate-controlled superconducting circuits, and high efficiency optical and optospintronic architectures, and fault-tolerant quantum computers. During the past decade a lot of fundamental research was done to understand the scientific principles that underpin the operation of these devices. The next challenge that must be overcome in order to realize the potential promise offered by these materials is the ability to build large scale prototype devices to show that these materials systems are viable candidates for 21st century technology. The acquisition of a high throughput electron beam lithography system is a key step in solving these challenges by enabling the rapid prototyping of novel devices.

"The NSF Convergence Accelerator supports team-based, multidisciplinary efforts that address challenges of national importance and show potential for deliverables in the near future. 

Properly educating the STEM leaders of tomorrow requires moving beyond knowledge being transmitted from teacher to learner via paper textbooks and lectures. The broader impact and potential social benefit of this Convergence Accelerator Phase 1 project is to launch the Textbook Open Knowledge Network (TOKN). The TOKN project will be executed by a multidisciplinary team of cognitive scientists, machine learning and artificial intelligence engineers, and educators from Rice University's OpenStax and Stanford University who are committed to creating a library of intelligent textbooks, engaging more partners as the project progresses. To begin, this project will build knowledge graphs that capture the complex relationships between educational concepts. A knowledge graph enables artificial intelligence algorithms to provide enhanced and personalized functionality to intelligent textbooks. Consequently, the intelligent textbook can provide more robust courseware functionality (text, videos, simulations, etc.), learning analytics, and personalized tutoring, such as automatically generating summaries of textbook content, generating useful practice exercises for students, providing interactive dialogues with students to help them better understand and master the underlying source material, and more.  Integrating this intelligent technology into the full OpenStax free and open library has the potential to impact academic outcomes for millions of students in both secondary and higher education, while significantly advancing the state of education worldwide. 

Intelligent textbooks provide an opportunity to facilitate better learning for students. However, they require major investments of time, money, and expertise. An appropriate knowledge graph is at the heart of an intelligent textbook and is often the biggest challenge to intelligent textbook creation due to the need for human subject experts to develop the semantic connectivity of terms and ideas. TOKN aims to develop new, scalable processes and supporting technologies for generating high-quality and extensible knowledge graphs for intelligent textbooks. The proposed research aims to lower both the cost and time required to produce high-quality knowledge graphs. In contrast to using subject matter experts, this project proposes to use a combination of machine learning algorithms and crowdsourcing of knowledge from students. Crowdsourcing will not only provide data for knowledge graphs, but it will also provide an opportunity to evaluate the pedagogical effectiveness of concept mapping on student learning. Phase 1 of this project will include a proof of concept to construct and validate a knowledge graph for one chapter of OpenStax Biology, a free and open-source text used by more than 30% of students in college biology programs. The overarching goal is to eventually apply this approach at scale during Phase 2 to generate knowledge graphs for the entire OpenStax library of 38 general educational textbooks, transforming them into intelligent open textbooks for society.

"The United States is the most efficient producer (total value of $560 billion) and top exporter ($140 billion in 2017) of food in the world. Due to population growth and economic development, it is conservatively predicted that the U.S. food industry will need to grow by at least 70% by the year 2050 to meet the needs of global population reaching 9.7 billion. This is considered a grand challenge that requires revolutionary technological advances in order to achieve sustainable food production growth while avoiding negative environmental impact. A key challenge is that a significant fraction of increasingly limited resources used for food production is lost. These losses occur through a variety of forms including bio-wastes, co-products from food processing and ethanol refining, food wastes, fertilizer runoff, and municipal and agricultural wastewaters. These losses are causing national and global crises by contributing to many interconnected problems including resource scarcity (e.g., clean water, soil nutrients), environmental pollution (e.g., excess levels of nutrients in the Gulf of Mexico), and high energy consumption (e.g., for treating bio-waste). Further, increasing climate variability may induce greater variability in nutrient fluxes and exacerbate these interconnected problems. Despite decades of efforts by the government and private agencies, the system-wide trend continues to worsen. The present practices are fragmented and do not provide an effective solution that society is ready to adopt. This Engineering Research Center (ERC) planning grant aims to develop activities that will address resource security and environmental sustainability revolution that will potentially turn these trends.

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and partners Princeton University, University of Michigan, University of Illinois at Chicago, and Virginia State University propose an Innovation in Resource loss Reduction, Recovery and Reuse (InnR3) ERC to generate a holistic, novel solution that will resolve the interconnected problems. Instead of focusing on a particular technology for a single problem, this ERC planning grant targets a convergent solution composed of a coordinated portfolio of technologies coupled with region specific policies to resolve a system of problems caused by nutrient loss. The project targets a solid work plan and a qualified team to expand the technology portfolio of interconnected problems in the entire food production (primarily in rural areas) and consumption (primarily in urban areas) cycle across spatial scales from field, farm, industry, small watersheds and large basins. Through a series of workshops and virtual meetings, this planning project will identify fundamental knowledge gaps, technology innovation barriers and institutional barriers for system level integration and adoption. These activities will also serve to identify additional needed partners through strategically organized working group discussions. This planning project will work to create a new, diverse workforce of research, education, and practice leaders for realizing InnR3 and create an interdisciplinary student-centered learning framework. Beyond the national concerns regarding degradation of the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes, this ERC targets societal impacts in terms of behaviors of food producers and consumers, health of the public, environmental sustainability, economic growth and prosperity, and regional stability.

"This award supports the operation of the Center for High Energy X-ray Science (CHEXS) at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) as a national user facility.  CHEXS consists of a suite of four high-energy X-ray beamlines that serve the national user community in specifically targeted research areas. Each beamline seamlessly integrates sample/specimen preparation, data collection, and data processing, and is optimized for operation by domain scientists rather than by expert X-ray users. Education and training is being integrated into all aspects of the facility, addressing the education and training of researchers having little prior experience with X-rays and the education of undergraduate students from Under Represented Groups (URGs) in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). NSF funds from the Directorates for Biological Sciences, the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the Directorate for Engineering support the following four specific beamlines: 
- Forming and Shaping Technology, FAST, Beamline which supports sub-millisecond time-resolved studies of manufacturing processes such as laser welding and rapid quenching. The rich datasets obtained rigorously benchmarks transformational new models enabled by advanced computational tools; 
- the High-Pressure Biology,Hp-Bio, Beamline: the sophisticated new sample cells of the ""HP-Bio"" beamline enables precise high-pressure structural studies of the rules of life at the molecular level, a regime not currently accessible to biologists.
- Q-Mapping for Quantum Materials (QM2) Beamline provides high-throughput characterization of quantum materials in reciprocal space (also known as ""Q-space"") to uncover intertwined quantum correlations of spins, charges, and orbitals, from high to low temperatures and spanning entire phase diagrams.
- Photon-in, Photon-out X-ray Spectroscopy (PIPOXS) Beamline enables spectroscopic studies of valence electronic states in functional - materials using hard x-rays, allowing access to opaque materials or sample environments. In situ and operando studies of man-made catalysts and enzymes is the initial focus with additional applications to fuel-cells, batteries, and electronic excitations in quantum materials.
CHEXS is also engaged in development of X-ray technologies targeted to achieve CHEXS science goals, including new high-energy undulator insertion devices, diamond high-heat load optics, and focusing for analysis by custom-fabricated glass capillary optics or channel arrays. CHEXS supports post-docs and Ph.D. students, hosts hands-on scientific workshops to train new users in X-ray methods, provides summer training and mentorship programs targeting undergraduates from underrepresented groups in STEM fields, and provides high quality informational materials to the general public.

"This award will help defray travel expenses for participants in a symposium and workshop at the annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology in Austin, Texas, in January 2020. Plants and animals each have unique solutions for mechanical problems, including sticking to surfaces, folding, dispersal, and responding to mechanical loads. Several of these solutions have been sources for bio-inspiration, such as self-cleaning surfaces inspired by the lotus leaf. The symposium brings together plant and animal researchers that tackle similar problems in different systems under the unifying theme of ""biological solutions to mechanical problems that might lead to engineering applications."" A diverse group of researchers will exchange ideas that cross scales at an exciting frontier of trans-disciplinary research. As part of this symposium, conference participants will have the opportunity to consult with science communication experts to showcase their research to the general public and other stakeholders through effective press releases and social media posts. Pre-conference and on-site meetings among the symposium presenters will facilitate collaborations and preparation of scientific manuscripts. This symposium will result in the publication of original research papers, research reviews, and perspectives in a special issue of a scientific journal. The special journal issue will be complemented by a lesson plan for college instructors to facilitate the use of symposium special issues as textbooks or supplementary instructional material in their courses.

Plants and animals evolved often complex solutions to the same physical problems. Transferring those solutions into biomimetic materials and processes comes with new challenges, such as scalability. To understand and transfer biological solutions to physical problems, an inter-disciplinary approach that combines research in biology, engineering, and physics has been used. A road less travelled is to explicitly compare the evolved solutions of animals and plants, as well as the experimental approaches used by researchers in these fields, which are two goals of the symposium. The symposium will foster intellectual exchange among scientists who share a given research question, yet address it from different angles, using different model systems and approaches, with a focus on the topics of adhesion, locomotion and dispersal, and response to mechanical loads. The symposium offers a synthesis of ideas while highlighting the work of diverse, emerging investigators from the US and abroad. The symposium will include a workshop on public outreach, which will help scientists to promote their research to the public. Additional engagement opportunities will be provided during online breakout discussions and networking sessions. Professional networking and collaborations will be facilitated as scientists produce career-relevant deliverables, such as scientific publications (original articles, a more historical review article and a forward-looking perspective article focusing on remaining challenges and urgent areas of inquiry) and products that support dissemination to the public (press releases, blog posts, podcasts, social media posts). Additionally, the symposium organizers will collaborate with educational experts to develop an educational module based on using the symposium publications as a textbook or textbook supplement in courses on comparative physiology, comparative biomechanics, biomimetics, and integrative biology.

"This doctoral research project examines how trauma experienced by women may be transmitted across generations, affecting their well-being and the well-being of their children. Working with populations who have endured high-stress environments, the investigators will conduct in-depth interviews with women when they are pregnant and subsequently measure markers of stress in those women and their infants, to understand how trauma affects women and children socially, emotionally, and biologically. Through these bio-ethnographic methods, the project will advance our understanding of epigenetic responses to the environment in humans. The project will also contribute to graduate training and mentoring and may inform public health research and behavioral health interventions. 

This project considers how biosocial inheritance, or the means by which social adversity or advantage is transmitted across generations, may play a role in intergenerational trauma. Specifically, this project considers (1) how women enduring adverse environments subjectively construct their traumatic experience; (2) whether maternal trauma may be ""molecularized"" at the level of the epigenome; (3) whether maternal traumatic experience is associated with neuroendocrine stress during pregnancy; and (4) whether maternal epigenetic or neuroendocrine signals correspond to those seen in offspring in early life. In this study of 112 mother-infant dyads, mothers' subjective appraisals of trauma will be elicited through semi-structured and life history interviews, which will be used to contextualize their responses to a survey of traumatic exposure and a trauma symptoms checklist. Their biological incorporation of trauma will be assessed with measures of DNA methylation and hair cortisol concentration. Methylation will be measured at five genes that are involved in the neuroendocrine stress response: NR3C1, FKBP5, BDNF, SLC6A4, and MAOA. To evaluate for broader patterns of epigenetic modification, epigenome-wide methylation analyses will also be conducted. To investigate the potential for intergenerational programming, this project will measure chronic cortisol secretion in mothers, cortisol reactivity following a modest stressor in infants at eight weeks of age, and DNA methylation at these five stress-related loci in both mothers and infants.

"This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports research that will contribute new fundamental knowledge in the field of surface science, related to liquid-repellent surfaces (often called non-stick coatings). Typically, liquid-repellent surfaces are made with long chain fluorocarbon materials. However, long chain fluorocarbon materials are rapidly being phased out because of the growing concerns regarding their negative environmental and biological impacts. This research promotes national health by developing alternative surface treatments to the currently used toxic bio-accumulating materials. New hydro- and omniphobic materials are increasingly in demand for defense and commercial applications in textiles, surface coatings in harsh or ""dirty"" environments, among others. The work advances the science of surface repellents by providing the basic knowledge needed to design novel liquid-repellent surfaces with the more benign short chain fluorocarbon materials and with performance (i.e., degree of liquid repellency) equivalent to the long chain fluorocarbon materials. Such innovative liquid-repellent surfaces have the potential to drastically alter the non-stick coatings technology landscape in civilian, industrial and defense sectors. Therefore, the results and insights from this research will be significantly beneficial to the U.S. economy and society. The education activities are integrated with this research through the generation of STEM education kits and do-it-yourself (DIY) videos on ""Fun with Surface"" to be used in K-12 science classes in conjunction with teacher training workshops.

Liquid-repellent surfaces consisting of long chain fluorocarbons (i.e., linear molecules with 8 or more fully fluorinated carbons) decompose into perfluorooctanoic acid, which is bio-accumulative and is considered an emerging contaminant. So, it is essential to develop alternative sustainable materials (e.g., short chain fluorocarbons) that can be as liquid-repellent as long chain fluorocarbons. The research is based on the hypothesis that short chain fluorocarbons with high surface crystallinity and re-entrant morphology will offer liquid-repellency equivalent to long chain fluorocarbons. To test this hypothesis, the research team will systematically investigate the influence of molecular architecture of fluorocarbon surface ligands and surface modification reaction coordinates on surface crystallinity and morphology. The resulting liquid-repellency will be investigated experimentally and compared with theoretical predictions. Overall, this research will provide a thorough understanding of molecular architecture-processing-structure-property relationships involved in design of liquid-repellent surfaces and pave the way to a paradigm of sustainable liquid-repellent surfaces.

"This grant supports research that contributes to the development of advanced manufacturing methods to enable the capture of carbon dioxide from industrial waste gases. Greenhouse gases are the principal factor driving climate change and one of the most detrimental human-derived waste products is carbon dioxide. Current technologies to sequester carbon dioxide are energy intensive and inefficient. This research develops a process to manufacture carbon-capture membranes that are inexpensive, energy efficient, and scalable to meet this growing societal need. The research relies on polymer melt-processing, a plastic manufacturing technique that enables the large-scale production of most common plastic goods. The innovation is using melt-processing to integrate biochemical catalysts or enzymes into plastic membranes to sequester carbon dioxide. Enzymatic carbon dioxide capture occurs at room temperature to produce solid carbon salts which can be easily stored, thus greatly reducing the energy demand. The outcome of this research greatly benefits society, since climate change is a grand challenge in engineering, and, thus, is instrumental in securing the prosperity and security of the country. This research is multi-disciplinary and includes polymer science, chemical engineering, materials science, and biochemistry. Students conducting this research are trained at the forefront of science, which has a long-term positive impact on the nation?s technological output. 

The use of carbonic anhydrase as a carbon dioxide capture catalyst is promising given the enzymes rapid turnover number, minimal energy input for sequestration and ability to sequester carbon into solid salts. The limiting factor for applying carbonic anhydrase broadly is a manufacturing challenge that requires scalability and reproducibility. Current enzyme immobilization processes operate in batch mode and rely on adsorption or non-specific chemical reactions to a solid support, limiting scalability and reproducibility. This research develops continuous manufacturing methods to incorporate carbonic anhydrase into permeable polymer membranes that can be fabricated at large scale. The primary hurdle in accomplishing this goal is to develop a fundamental understanding of processing conditions under which carbonic anhydrase maintains stability and activity during melt-extrusion. This project seeks to understand the main stressors, temperature and shear, during processing and correlate these to enzyme performance. Once this relationship has been established, the results are used to scale-up polymer membrane manufacture to twin-screw extruders, similar to those used in commercial film manufacturing. These membranes are evaluated for carbon dioxide flux, sequestration, and durability in environments that mimic complex mixtures of industrial waste gases.

"Through this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Professor James Larrabee at Middlebury College to carry out fundamental studies of three metallohydrolases using magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy. These metallohydrolases are able to detoxify chemical warfare agents and thus are of current importance for society.  MCD spectroscopy allows the researchers to monitor changes that occur in the active sites of the enzymes when they are attached to nanoparticles and/or genetically modified and it provides clues about the chemical origins of the changes in their activity. This research could provide a scientific basis for creating improved bio-remediation agents.  The funded research is conducted at Middlebury College by undergraduate students. Research experiences strengthen the interest of undergraduate students in furthering their science education and the pursuit in careers in science. 

The aim of the research project is to attach three metallohydrolases to silica, alumina or magnetite nanoparticles.  Earlier studies conducted in the Larrabee lab were on the free enzymes, not on the enzymes attached to nanoparticles. The enzyme attachment to nanoparticles could improve both the activity and stability of the enzymes. The Larrabee research group also studies mutant forms of the enzymes that have enhanced activity. The active sites of the three enzymes are chemically and spectroscopically similar. The research group of Professor Larrabee studies the enzymes in the form in which they contain Co(II) ions.  MCD spectroscopy is used to study the changes of the metal environment caused by the binding of the enzymes to the nanoparticles or by mutations. The outcome of the research could be used to make these enzymes more useful as bio-remediation agents.

"To continue to remain competitive in the global economy, the U.S. must utilize its diverse talents to advance scientific knowledge and technological innovation. This project aims to increase the diversity of STEM researchers and professoriate. The American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) will continue the Lighting the Pathway (LTP) program, started in August 2014, to increase the representation of American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians in STEM faculty positions at colleges and universities across the country. The LTP program provides mentorship, professional development, community, and network-building opportunities year-round, both in-person and virtually, to facilitate LTP students successfully completing their degrees, advancing to the next academic stage, and persisting along the STEM academic career path. Planned activities will reinforce Native cultural identity, leverage existing resources, and create a network of Native STEM scholars and faculty. The LTP program helps scholars to overcome feelings of isolation both socially and culturally by connecting them with Native peers and mentors and with their broader STEM community. An evaluation component will be used to understand which critical elements of the LTP program are most effective in retaining students in STEM. The evaluation will assess the impact of the program on scholar persistence in STEM. Knowledge gained from this evaluation can inform the design of training programs for other underrepresented groups.

The project will recruit Native undergraduate, graduate and postdoc students whose major field of study is in the biosciences, engineering and/or geosciences. Over the course of 5 years, AISES will recruit a total of 72 students with interest in a career in academia. Each cohort group of 18 students will engage in the program for a period of two years, with possibility of staying in the program for continued mentoring and career guidance. Each LTP student will be matched with a senior faculty mentor, who will provide guidance in the student's academic endeavors and help in navigating the STEM career path. LTP participants will be encouraged to present their research work at a relevant scientific conference in their field of study. Students and mentors will also attend the AISES National Conference with a specific day dedicated to faculty career development. Additionally, the LTP students will receive professional development and coaching through webinars, assistance with applying for fellowship, and other activities relevant to success in a STEM career. The program will assist undergraduate participants in securing research experiences, provide training in leadership and other professional skills that will help them advance to the next academic level. These findings will serve as a guide for future, expanded-scale projects and will also inform application to other underrepresented groups.

This project is supported by the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO), Engineering (ENG) and Geosciences (GEO).

"An inspiring feature of certain photosynthetic organisms is their ability to transfer energy from one protein to another with significant efficiency and range. It has been shown that such a remarkable light harvesting process is deeply rooted in quantum mechanical processes at physiological temperatures. Imitating such processes to generate efficient and ultra-long range of flow of energy along specific paths in systems consisting of biologically assembled nanostructures is a transformative frontier of research with many technological impacts. This requires uncharted capabilities to control the energy transfer routes in real space with very low amount of loss. This project is a collaborative interdisciplinary effort between research groups with expertise in nanophotonics at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and virus nanotechnology at the University of Oklahoma. The team will develop transformative concepts and physical/biological processes that allow transfer of excitation energy in viral energy circuits over ultra-long distances that are relevant to nanodevices and their integration. The biologically-inspired energy circuits will consist of a nanowire, formed via a genetically modifiable protein landscape (phage) and semiconductor nanocrystals, and two designated nanocrystals that act as light harvesting and receiver antennas. The team will develop a novel material platform that can dramatically change the normal properties of such nanocrystals, allowing the viral nanowires to transport energy over long distances by closely imitating photosynthesis process. This includes energy transfer between domains of nanocrystals correlated with each other via their interaction with metallic nanostructures. This project offers a new path towards application of biology for building devices with nanoscale dimension. It will also create new opportunities for the design of efficient bio-inorganic hybrid systems for light emitting devices, detectors, and sensors. This interdisciplinary project will integrate physical and biological education by implementing a strong teaching and mentoring component, and will introduce the essence of nanotechnology and nanoscience to high school students.       
Technical 
The overall goal of this project is to develop transformative concepts and physical/biological processes for energy-transporting materials that will involve bio-inorganic composite structures and biologically-inspired collective properties. These processes allow transfer of excitation energy in viral energy circuits over ultra-long distances that are relevant to nanodevices and their integration (100 nm or more). Quantum dot nanowires formed via genetically engineered non-toxic virus will be used as energy channels. These quantum dot-coated viral nanowires will be biologically conjugated to a light harvesting antenna (Up-Conversion Nanoparticles) in one end and quantum dot receivers at the other end, forming biologically-templated energy circuits. The team will develop a novel landscape of material structure called metal oxide plasmonic metasubstrate (MOPM) to generate the transformative processes needed to allow the light energy absorbed by the light harvesting nanoantennas to be transported to the QD receivers along QD nanowires with low energy loss. MOPMs will be formed via the creative composition of metallic nanoantenna arrays, dielectric materials, and metal oxides. Immobilizing the biologically-templated energy circuits to MOPM leads to (i) formation of domains of phase-correlated dipole-dipole coupling between QDs across the viral nanowires, (ii) ultrahigh enhancement of their radiative decay (Purcell effect), and (iii) suppression of their defect environments. The transport of the energy across viral QD nanowires occurs via the transfer of excitation energy between the phase-correlated domains, rather than between individual QDs, and formation of inter-domain coupling using surface lattice resonances or plasmonic coupling. MOPM enhances QD-induced exciton-plasmon coupling significantly, aligning the dipoles of QDs in each domain while suppressing transfer of their energies to the metallic nanoantennas. These lead to ultralong range inter-domain energy transfer before radiative or non-radiative losses kick in.

"Discovering interactions between the attributes in a data set provides insight into the underlying structure of the data and explains the relationships between the attributes. This project develops multi-disciplinary approaches that integrate computer science, statistics, and epidemiology techniques to mine interaction relationships among attributes and phenotypes (traits or class labels) in biological data sets. Specifically, this project develops innovative and statistically sound methodologies for mining novel interactions within attributes or between attributes and phenotypes to help identify critical factors in biological applications.  In particular, the novel analysis methods can enable the genetic and environmental interactions underlying a range of complex diseases to be delineated. The research activities of this project can also promote the integration of biology, computer science, and statistics, which is highly significant to many applications. 

The project will formulate various metrics that enable efficient pruning and searching in the multi-dimensional combinatorial space for identifying significant interaction relationships. This enables highly effective approaches that build search-based trees or identify highly correlated subspaces to detect meaningful local interactions that may not be significant considering the whole data sets but are strongly interacted with traits on a subset of data. This enables comparison of data from multiple different groups such as based on age, race, or other properties. It is important to find both common and different interactions in different groups so that effective methods can be developed for targeted groups. The methods developed will detect complex interactions between attributes in multiple groups simultaneously by capturing both their commonalities and differences in joint matrix factorization or deep learning models. These approaches are remarkably powerful for biological applications, such as detecting gene-gene interactions and gene-environmental interactions that lead to breast cancer. The concept of interaction is also ubiquitous and important in many scientific disciplines ranging from economics, sociology and physics, to the pharmaceutical sciences. The novel approaches and analysis tools developed in this project are useful for finding out any interaction relationships between attributes associated with phenotype labels or without phenotype labels. These approaches and tools are general and are applicable to a variety of applications.","Charlottesville","University of Virginia Main Campus","47.070","198062","Info Integration & Informatics","1924928","aidong@virginia.edu","Aidong","Zhang","03/14/2019","01/03/2019","07/31/2020","III: Medium: High-Dimensional Interaction Analysis in Bio-Data Sets","BIO"
"Engineered nanomaterials have demonstrated biomedical applications in diagnostics, imaging, and drug delivery. For widespread adoption of these technologies, potential adverse health effects in both the short and long-term should be thoroughly explored.  Due to their novel nanoscale properties, the manner in which these nanomaterials interact with biological systems is complex and relatively unknown, and very few tools exist to accurately understand the fate of these nanomaterials in cells, animals and humans. This CAREER award will fund a research program that introduces a new imaging technique to more precisely describe the locations and numbers of nanomaterials within the confines of live cells. This research will generate new knowledge, where quantitative imaging data will be correlated to established measures of cell health, leading to a better understanding of nanomaterial-induced toxicity. The work will be closely integrated into an educational and outreach program that engages the local K-12 community with interactive seminars and hands-on laboratory experience investigating interactions at the nano-bio interface. Finally, the work will enable the formation of a highly interdisciplinary bionanotechnology course, with particular emphasis on nanotoxicology, to further stimulate and educate the STEM-focused workforce within Rhode Island. Together, these activities support the broader impacts and dissemination of the work by generating widespread interest in STEM and improved understanding  of novel nanomaterial technologies. 

Engineering nanomaterials for the purposes of creating novel diagnostic, imaging, and drug delivery devices has garnered significant attention within the past two decades. A recently discovered one-dimensional allotrope of carbon, the single-walled carbon nanotube, with intrinsic near-infrared fluorescence that is indefinitely photostable and environmentally sensitive, presents a unique opportunity to create sensing and imaging constructs as research tools for live cell and animal studies. As with all exogenously introduced materials, adverse effects to cell health in both the short and long-term should be thoroughly explored. In the case of carbon nanotubes, the nanomaterial is known to enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis and remain within the endosomal pathway. For widespread adoption of nanotube-based sensors and imaging probes in standard biological applications, detrimental effects to the vesicles involved in this pathway should be investigated. The research objective of this CAREER project, using a novel spectral imaging approach for sub-cellular measurements within live cells, is to quantify the number of nanotubes in diffraction-limited regions within a cell and determine how naturally aggregated nanomaterials influence toxicity in mammalian cells. The research project seeks to: 1) employ hyperspectral fluorescence microscopy to investigate the nanostability that engineered nanotubes of varying physical properties exhibit in biological media, 2) investigate how nanotube functionalization, concentration, and aggregation state can affect the uptake and endosome loading ratio (nanotubes per endosome) in mammalian cells, and 3) examine how endosome loading ratio influences natural endosomal maturation processes (vesicle trafficking, endosome-to-lysosome progression, etc.), and correlate this to various cell stress and toxicity assays. The transformative nature of this work stems from the ability to pose and answer outstanding questions of nanotoxicology at the single-cell and sub-cellular level in a new manner that does not necessitate labeling or perturbing the biological system at hand. By performing these assays, a framework of rules will be created that governs the manner in which mammalian cells interact with nanotubes of various physical natures. The work will be thoroughly incorporated into a K-12 educational and outreach program with interactive seminars and practical laboratory experience probing biophysical interactions at the nano-bio interface. Finally, the work will enable the formation of a highly interdisciplinary bionanotechnology course, highlighting topics in nanotoxicology, to further stimulate and educate the STEM-focused workforce within Rhode Island.

"Fracture and wear are common issues in engineering - to the extent that the terms ""worn,"" ""fractured,"" and ""broken"" are generally synonymous with the end-of-utility of devices. In many cases, traditional materials fail to meet the complex, simultaneous performance requirements that would be ideal for next generation engineering systems. The enamel of the teeth of grazing animals represents one of nature's most remarkable biological materials -- a ceramic-like composite showing exceptional strength, toughness, wear-resistance, and ability to slow crack propagation. This is an important set of properties for a structure that is key to long-term survival in these animals - as functional teeth are required for feeding.  This EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will study these damage-tolerant biomaterials using a combination of evolutionary biology, biomechanics, and materials science. Results and methods from this research will be of considerable interest to investigators in many disciplines, including engineering, materials science, evolutionary biology, ecology, comparative anatomy, mammalogy, and paleontology. The research will also support the development of novel, sustainable materials with improved wear and fracture behavior. Graduate students will be involved in this truly interdisciplinary project and learn how the various fields can work together to tackle challenging questions.  This research will also introduce a more effective, evolutionary approach for exploring nature for biomimetic examples.

The goal of this interdisciplinary research is to specifically understand the biomechanical form, function and performance of enamel lattices, known as Modified Radial Enamel (MRE), in the grinding teeth of large herbivorous mammals.  Samples will be obtained from numerous species, including equines (horses), bovids (e.g. bison and cattle) and suids (e.g. warthogs). This study will specifically focus on how these animals' teeth endure tens to hundreds of millions of high stress contact loading cycles and impacts while chewing tough and abrasive plant matter, such as grasses whose roots are laden with hard, fracture-promoting sediment inclusions. The underlying hypothesis is that MRE is an evolutionarily optimized compromise for: 1) incredible fracture resistance due to prism arrangements that localize damage and strategically control crack direction; 2) unexpected strength and toughness made possible by compliant proteinaceous prism sheaths that circumvent hydroxyapatite's inherent brittleness; and 3) wear resistance conveyed through hard, hyper-mineralized, oriented enamel prisms. The project will investigate this hypothesis through two objectives.  First, the study will use an evolutionary biology approach to identify the ancestral enamel fabric character states to MRE that independently evolved in horses, bovids and warthogs. From this information, it will be possible to readily identify the specific evolutionary modifications to the enamel fabrics that enabled grinding and identify living species that can be used to undertake comparative biomechanical assessment.  Second, the project will investigate the structure-property relationships of the enamel across multiple length scales by comprehensively characterizing the material properties using micro-and nano-mechanical tools, spectroscopy, and advanced electron microscopy. Teeth of grinding species with MRE will be compared with close relatives that retain the ancestral enamel fabrics, thereby revealing the salient anatomical changes that enabled the optimized combination of biomechanical properties.

"Innovations in engineering and technology have significantly promoted and advanced scientific discoveries over the last few decades. These innovations have not only been rapid, but have also increased the quality and reduced the cost of healthcare and inspired new research areas, such as precision medicine. Additionally, these scientific discoveries reveal the importance of increased collaboration between researchers in medicine and engineering to address the problems and obstacles that arise in health care, and, most notably, for the development of new education directions to translate medical science and engineering concepts into curriculums and clinical research for the preparation of the next generation global healthcare workforce.  To accentuate these critical and emerging developments, the summer school 2019 will be held at the Orthodox Academy of Crete (OAC), Kolympari, Chania, Crete, Greece, June 9-15, 2019 with the participation of 30 undergraduate and graduate students and 8 faculty. The main objective of this proposed education program is to expose undergraduate and graduate biological science and bioengineering students to new approaches and advancements in the brain and life sciences, data science and artificial intelligence for biomedicine, healthcare entrepreneurship and innovation.

Emerging computational tools facilitate the collection and analysis of vast amounts of biomedical data collected at multiple temporal and spatial scales using smart sensors. The investigation of complex biomedical systems requires the integration of smart sensors and analytics and an extensive collaboration between biologists, mathematicians, computer scientists and engineers to improve our understanding of processes from genes to systems to behavior.

"Microbial communities are critically important for many environmental processes such as the release of nutrients from the degradation of dead organic matter.  Microbial communities are also important for health, as beneficial microbes help digest food, modulate immunity, and fend off intruding pathogens.  Each species of microbe in the community uses certain compounds available in the environment and often the microbes release new compounds that other members of the community can use.  These ""metabolic interactions"" impact the survival of individual species and the stability of the microbial community as a whole. The goal of this collaborative project is to better understand how these interactions develop and change depending on the environment and microbial species in the community, and how these interactions change the stability and composition of the communities.  Ultimately, this project aims to reveal principles for the design of microbial communities for purposes such environmental remediation.  Participants on this project will include high school teachers, underrepresented minority high school students, and underrepresented minority undergraduates.  

Microbial communities are ubiquitous, and are critical players in mediating host health and disease and in the cycling of elements in ecosystems.  Metabolic interactions between species impact community function and stability.  However, the emergence and evolution of metabolic interactions is poorly understood.  The laboratories involved in this project will take advantage of tractable synthetic yeast communities and mathematical modeling to experimentally and theoretically study the origin and evolution of metabolic interactions.  They will undertake a fully integrated, collaborative approach that combines the expertise of both groups on metabolic modeling, synthetic biology, and microbial ecology and evolution.  First, statistical thermodynamics and differential equations will be used to model metabolic overflows.  Next, metabolic overflows as well as key cellular parameters will be experimentally characterized using targeted metabolomics, fluorescence microscopy, and single cell electrochemical measurements. These experimental measurements will be used to constrain, test, and refine the model.  The tested model will be embedded within an in silico evolution framework to simulate evolution, and to predict how initial community conditions (e.g. nutrient environment, genotypes, and species interactions) might affect the evolution of new metabolic interactions.  Finally, model predictions will be tested by evolving synthetic yeast communities from different starting conditions in chemostats and turbidostats, and emerging metabolic interactions will be characterized.

This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.

"Multiband radio frequency (RF) systems are essential for commercial, defense, and everyday consumer uses. Further multiband RF resources have recently been released for new applications such as the 5G system. Although these new developments could lead to useful new applications being supported and more people able to enjoy the associated advantages, we can only realize these benefits if we can ensure high-quality transmission performance. This outcome is challenging to achieve because the bandwidth of multiband RF signals can be several gigahertz wide, and current electronic technologies are not capable of dynamically manipulating such a wide spectrum. This research aims to overcome this challenge by making use of photonics, an alternative signal processing method that has much wider bandwidth and faster speed than its counterpart in electronics. With the proposed photonics techniques, the RF signal is first converted to an optical signal, which can then be processed almost instantaneously and dynamically. This research focuses on the dynamic and precise tailoring and equalizing of RF spectral response over ultra-wide/multiple frequency bands. We will also carry out a comprehensive education plan closely related to the research that includes developing mobile apps for learning fiber optics, visiting local elementary and high schools, developing undergraduate freshman seminars and cross-disciplinary courses, and providing research experiences for high school and undergraduate students. This research will strengthen vital wireless services in the United States, including smart home system control, augmented reality learning, and surveillance and reconnaissance efforts.

While new RF resources from MHz to tens of GHz have been made available to emerging wireless technologies such as the 5G system, the inability to dynamically and precisely manipulate the whole available RF spectrum hinders the performance of the associated multi-/wideband systems. The mission of this research is to use photonics to enable effective and precise manipulation of wide radio spectrum of tens of GHz. Two closely related research themes are proposed: (i) Developing a photonics-based radio frequency spectrum shaper that can achieve tens of GHz bandwidth of continuous spectral tailoring capability with greater than 50-dB dynamic amplitude compensation, and (ii) Developing a radio frequency photonic subsystem to enable independent multiband RF spectral shaping and chirp control. The radio frequency spectral shaper exploits the multi-point spectral control capabilities of a uniquely designed RF multiband filter, the heterogeneous spectral property control algorithm, and the instantaneous response of existing optical devices to achieve dynamic radio frequency spectrum tailoring from low- to high-frequency bands. The dynamic spectral manipulation of radio frequency spectrum enables independent control of frequency, amplitude, spectral shape, bandwidth, and group delay slope at each spectral control point. This proposal presents a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, and innovative approach to solve the challenging wideband radio frequency channel response problem while offering a solution to individually and precisely tailor the wideband and multiband radio frequency spectrum. The proposed research involves a close coupling of system design and experimental validation, and thus will yield laboratory prototypes to demonstrate more effective operation of wideband and multiband radio frequency systems.

"Nanotechnology has gained considerable attention in agricultural applications, due to the unique properties of materials at the nanoscale. Nanomaterials also exhibit an ability to bypass biological barriers. These novel materials may elicit beneficial as well as undesirable responses depending on their composition, method of application, dose or the sensitivity of the crop species. There is limited understanding of how plants respond to these nanomaterials, how they take them up, and at what point the application results in undesirable effects. The project utilizes sensitive bio-analytical tools to study the response of plants to different doses of nanomaterials. The knowledge obtained from this study should serve to design safer nano-scale agrochemicals, improve their effectiveness and promote agricultural sustainability by reducing the use of active ingredients and undesirable accumulation of agrochemicals in soil and associated water bodies. The overarching goal of this research is to apply advanced analytical methods to understand   potential challenges in agriculture that can improve crop productivity and health, while minimizing burden on overall environmental health. 

The proposed project will employ sensitive molecular ""nomics"" approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of uptake of metal oxide nanoparticles by crop plants and plant response at different doses. Multi-omic tools considered include high-throughput proteomics and metabolomics using advanced liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. These tools will be used to probe the interactions at the protein and metabolite levels in plants exposed to metal oxide nanoparticles such as copper hydroxide, molybdenum oxide, manganese oxide and cerium oxide via foliar and soil application. Plasma-membrane proteins and apoplastic proteins are critical candidates for this study as they participate in communication between cells and the extracellular environment, ion transport, protein translocation/integration, and signal transduction. These protein in roots and leaves may be selectively enriched in the sample pool, helping to elucidate the main transport pathways. Analysis of hydrophilic and hydrophobic metabolites will also be fractionated for untargeted metabolomics. The candidate proteins and metabolites from untargeted -omic approach will be validated and quantified using targeted approaches across different exposure periods and concentrations, followed by meta-data integration to identify universal biomarkers of metal oxide nanoparticle exposure. The findings will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the routes of entry and localization of nanoparticles and simultaneous regulation of essential nutrients and plant metabolites. The results obtained will provide a benchmark for future research on targeted delivery of nutrients or other agrochemicals.

"Nearly all Americans participate in physical rehabilitation therapy at some point in their lifespan. Physical therapy can be highly effective in alleviating pain and restoring function, however only a third of physical therapy patients fully adhere to their plans of care. Future gains in improving the effectiveness of physical therapy will require patient-specific monitoring of the accuracy and frequency of therapeutic exercises. However, low-cost ways to accurately monitor therapeutic exercise do not currently exist. The goal of this project is to use cutting-edge advances in nano-composite sensor, artificial intelligence, and communication technologies to develop an affordable, wearable, sensing system for monitoring physical rehabilitative therapy exercises for patients who have recently had a total knee replacement (TKR). These key characteristics will be used to provide instant biofeedback to patients and clinicians, inside or outside of the traditional physical therapy clinic. The new wearable sensing system will be used to monitor therapeutic exercise on an individual and population scale, facilitating the creation of a massive and previously unattainable database of therapeutic exercise characteristics. Further, results from this project will have application in any context where real-life characterization of human movement is important, for example, worksite safety or athletic performance. This project will involve numerous graduate and undergraduate research assistants pursuing careers in engineering or science, as well as undergraduate research assistants pursuing careers in medicine or physical therapy. It is also anticipated that the resulting wearable sensing system will be used as a teaching tool in physical therapy curricula, an application that will be evaluated in this project.

The goal of this project is to engineer and evaluate a wearable nano-biosensing system that leverages recent development by the investigators in the area of skin-like nano-composite sensors, as a new approach to characterize the biomechanics of physical rehabilitation performed by patients during self-guided and clinician controlled physical therapy. The guiding hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Wearable nano-biosensing systems based upon a 3D network of piezoresponsive sensors can be designed with adequate resolution of kinematics to identify and characterize physical rehabilitation exercises; 2)The mechanical characteristics of self-guided physical rehabilitation exercises are fundamentally different from the mechanical characteristics of physical rehabilitation exercises performed under the direct supervision of a clinician and 3) Combining biofeedback with a wearable nano-biosensing system can quantitatively and qualitatively decrease differences between self-guided and clinician-supervised physical rehabilitation.  The Research Plan is organized under three objectives related to these hypotheses.  The FIRST Objective is to undertake the materials science and engineering research required to create and validate a 3D wearable, nanocomposite biosensing system whose hardware and software components will be encapsulated into a Mobile Environment of Nanosensors for Tracking Out-of-clinic Rehabilitation (MENTOR). The system will be designed to fully capture the kinematics and kinetics of rehabilitation exercises for post total knee replacement (TKR) recovery.  High sensitivity, elastomer-based nanocomposite strain sensors will be positioned in a system of 2D sensing membranes whose response can be accurately interpreted in terms of 3D joint kinematics. Smart insoles to capture ground reaction forces (GRF)) will be expanded to include piezoresistive pressure sensing of static forces in order to detect stance during rehabilitation exercises in addition to GRF while walking and running.  The SECOND Objective is to measure, validate, and compare lower-extremity biomechanics of clinician-guided outpatient rehabilitation exercises with that of the same patients performing the same exercises in a self-guided setting independent of direct clinician supervision.  Biomechanics will be measured using both traditional motion analysis tools and the MENTOR wearable sensing system.  The THIRD Objective is to measure and compare the biomechanics of clinician-guided outpatient rehabilitation exercises with that of the same patients performing the same exercises, self-guided, with and without realtime biofeedback when using the MENTOR wearable sensing system. The wearable MENTOR system will be combined with a simple, smartphone-based biofeedback system whose purpose is to assist the patients in correctly performing the rehabilitation exercises at the desired quality (similar biomechanical characteristics) and quantity (e.g., desired number of sets and repetitions). A simple Knee Motion Dashboard will provide the patient and clinician with quantitative sensor information regarding rehabilitation progress.

"Non-Technical: 
Cartilage is the firm connective tissue found in human joints. The damage attributed to cartilage over time presents a tremendous challenge for millions of Americans, and ultimately fosters the development of osteoarthritis. Given this important need to mitigate the damage to cartilage, it is critical that new therapeutic implantable materials are developed for human joints. In order to discover, understand, and ultimately utilize new biomaterial, fundamental knowledge of the behavior of these materials in a complex mechanical stress and biological environment is required. This award will support graduate and undergraduate training on the preparation and evaluation of new therapeutic materials for cartilage tissue repair and will further our understanding of how they respond under stressed environments that lead to osteoarthritis. Additionally, students at Morehouse College will prepare short films to engage society into learning about biomaterial science while also hosting outreach activities for local Atlanta Public School students. This activity will facilitate the development of a community of learners ranging from K-12, undergraduate, post graduate, to adults.

Articular cartilage is a highly ordered avascular connective tissue that lines the articular joints and is known to withstand enormous biomechanical loads having a frictionless surface for optimal mobility. However, articular cartilage is limited in its ability to repair itself after defects from disease or injury. At the onset of injury or disease, hypoxia  (low oxygen) disrupt the avascular architecture giving rise to the presence of reactive oxygen species that prevent healthy articular cartilage cell proliferation throughout the three-dimensional cartilage tissue matrix. Biomaterials that promote healthy 3D cell culture and proliferation under hypoxia are currently not available. The objective of this project focuses on the development of thermo-sensitive therapeutic laden hydrogels and the study of hypoxia on cell viability and hydrogel structure and function prepared from 3D printed bio-inks. This research entails the preparation, characterization, 3D printing, biochemical analysis, and spatial mapping of thermo-responsive therapeutic laden hydrogels that provide a new approach to regenerative tissue engineering. The use of hybrid therapeutic hydrogels to improve cell microenvironments and promote healthy extracellular matrix in 3D culture is of particular interest. The governing hypothesis of this project is driven by formulations of hybrid therapeutic laden hydrogels with robust structural integrity, higher oxygen diffusion coefficients, and the structural mimicry of articular cartilage zones via 3D printed bio-inks to provide cellular-protection under hypoxia towards chondrogenesis. Using hybrid therapeutic laden hydrogels, the Principal Investigator and research team evaluate how hypoxic induced reactive oxygen species mitigate cell fate, ECM amounts, and effect biomaterial properties. The effect of chemical modifications and the impact of structure and function in hybrid therapeutic hydrogels are noted for improved tissue engineering strategies.  The research team approaches include using chemical and polymer synthesis of preparation of hybrid therapeutic hydrogels, material characterization, 3D-printing using flow-based direct ink write, static cell culture of articular chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells under hypoxia and normoxia, and mechanical stimulation regimes to assess chemical structure phase changes, along with temporal and  spatial localization of extra cellular matrix proteins. Finally, new knowledge will be gained from this research by contributions to the development of novel therapeutic hydrogels for cartilage tissue engineering and regeneration by improving biomaterial properties to endure under pathophysiological conditions.

"Periodic oscillations are present at all levels of biology, from ecology and circadian clocks, to neural function and molecular phenomena. Oscillatory phenomena in the minute/hour range are, however, particularly intriguing since they have important roles in cellular and organ physiology but are poorly understood in terms of mechanisms. Pollen tubes are the male gametophytes of plants, indispensable for the formation of seeds, hence food, and display conspicuous oscillations of small inorganic ions in the minute range when grown in vitro. Previous work has identified these oscillations as implied in intracellular coordination and/or cell-cell communication and this project builds on previous research supported by the National Science Foundation that resulted in the development of a suite of statistical tools to study such oscillations with quantitative precision. Besides pollen tubes, these tools are being applied to phenomena ranging from circadian clocks to astrophysics, revealing unsuspected oscillatory patterns and their underlying mechanisms. The prevalence of oscillations associated with such widespread phenomena and different areas of scientific knowledge, make them attractive topics for any STEM education program, bridging mathematics and physics with biology at various levels. This project will have extensive training opportunities for students at all levels in the quantitative analysis of these oscillations in cellular function.

Pollen tubes, reach to the female gametophyte by chemotropism, which is the ability of some cells to grow towards or against an external stimuli. The present project will focus on the surprising finding that mutation of two genes coding for proteins that exchanges potassium against protons in the cell membrane of pollen tubes affect their chemotropic response  to an extent that the mutant plant barely produces any seed. It thus unveils a mechanism which is essential for food production. Preliminary evidence showed that the mutant pollen tubes have distinct oscillatory ""signatures"", which were taken as representing information about specific aspects of cell physiology. The present project will dissect quantitatively the nature of these oscillations when challenged with various negative and positive chemotropic molecules in different genetic backgrounds. Researchers will utilize state-of-the-art methods of cell imaging, molecular genetics, biophysics and mathematical biology. The project is crafted around the hypothesis that the disturbances in proton or potassium concentration resulting from these mutations will affect cell physiology by perturbing some basal level or property of the cell membrane, namely its electric potential, which in turn will render the signaling underlining the chemotropic reaction null. This stringent theoretical framework will be tested, on one hand, through the elaboration of mathematical models that can predict the robustness of key features of cell growth and, on the other hand, by direct proof that the electric potential of the cell membrane is affected is different ways in the mutant and the wildtype pollen tubes. Maintenance of electric potential potentials through cell membrane is a vital property of all living cells and has been evolutionarily co-opted for many fundamental physiological processes, e.g. excitability in the nervous system. The major transducers of energy to create such electric potentials in nature are proton-ATPases, proteins that ""pump"" protons out of the cell, thus creating a pH gradient used by numerous other proteins to transport molecules into and out of cells. This project will genetically dissect the proton-ATPase family of proteins to determine the boundaries of electric potential in the cell membrane outside of which chemotropism signaling becomes mute.The widespread relevance of chemosensing in biology and the expected mechanistic advances, suggests the present project has a high potential to generate new fundamental models for understanding these phenomena by bridging cell biology, biophysics and mathematical biology.

"Reflectins are a family of largely-disordered proteins in cephalopods that form tunable nano-assemlies to enable instantaneous change of their body color. In vitro these assemblies exhibit superb protonic conductance, comparable to the-state-of-the-art artificial materials. This project will elucidate the molecular mechanism underpinning the tunable coloration and superb protonic conductivity of reflectins. This knowledge will enable rational design of bio-compatible artificial materials based on reflectins with programmable optical and electrical properties. Multiple undergraduates and one graduate will be trained. The PI will exploit the fascinating nature of the protein in his outreach activities for local K-12 schools to promote STEM and to inspire next general scientists and engineers.


Several conserved amino acid sequences were found in homologous reflectins, recapitulating the properties of the full-length proteins. The intriguing optical and electrical properties were attributed to the ordered hierarchical structures and accompanied hydrogen bonding network in assemblies. However, the strong disorder of subunit proteins prohibits characterization at high resolution by techniques such as cryoEM or X-ray diffraction. This project will apply solid state NMR (ssNMR), the ideal technique for noncrystalline sample, to determine the atomic structural model of the assembly formed by one of the conserved fragments called (ref2C)4. This knowledge will resolve the paradox: how largely disordered subunit proteins assemble into ordered Bragg reflectors at light wavelength scale to modulate optical properties. Further ssNMR experiments will be performed to probe proton diffusion in the assembly, which will dissect the molecular motif at a residue-specific resolution responsible for the outstanding protonic conductivity.

This proposal is co-funded by Division of Materials Research (MPS/DMR), Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (ENG/CBET) and Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (BIO/MCB).

"Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The project seeks to develop a new method of separating agriculture biomass residues based on their electrostatic properties rather than size and density. 

Conventional wet processes to the purification of protein-rich biomass residues require large amounts of water and energy and the native functionality of the proteins is lost due to pH changes and temperature effects required for dehydration. This project will employ a tribo-electrostatic technique to pneumatically transfer milled agricultural residues into a fluidized bed reservoir where protein and fiber particles in the flour will be charged to different levels through collisions with the wall of the bed and/or interparticle contact, before being separated under the influence of an electric field. The long-term research goals are to expand the application of tribo-electrostatic separation (TES) technology to fractionate lignocellulosic biomass residues to further evaluate their tribo-charging behavior and to investigate the quality of the produced fractions for biofuel production. Moreover, these principles can be potentially used for food powder coating as well as coating solid pharmaceutical dosage forms to eliminate the use of organic solvents during conventional liquid coating technologies.

"Since 2003, the Forum on Nanotechnology Forum between U.S. and Korea has been held at alternating countries. The forum focuses on enhancing research collaboration in the field of nanotechnology conversion among scientists and engineers from both countries. Specifically, a joint forum facilitates networking between the research communities and agencies of both countries, enabling each side to exchange information and explore opportunities for research collaboration. This year the topics are nanomedicine focusing on single-cell level and sensors related to human cognition and brain research. The forum includes 8 senior presenters and 7 early-career presenters from U.S. and roughly equal number of Korean presenters will also participate. Organizing committee of this forum strives to place emphasis on diversity. This forum actively encourages partnerships in nanotechnology for breakthroughs in various topics, in addition to strengthening achievements and assessing the progress on recommendation made during the previous forums. All of the forum proceedings and findings are available on Carnegie Mellon's website for broad audiences. The contribution of this proposed forum is its ability to bring together a bi-national community of expert researchers and innovators who are working on the leading edge of nanomedicine focusing on single cell level and sensors related to human cognition. This forum will stimulate efforts to promote the above two areas by fully utilizing nanotechnology convergence to bio-information-cognitive technology. The outcome of this forum will lead to milestone and vigorous research collaboration of both countries where nanotechnology convergence will generate a great impact. 

As we enter the 4th industrial revolution, which is characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres, the rapid increase in the enormous amount of data processed and stored led us to a need for an emerging field of technologies including human cognition and nanomedicine. To fully explore these technologies, nanotechnology convergence with bio-information-cognitive methods play a critical role. The following two topics will be scrutinized during this 16th Forum. (a) Nanomedicine focusing on single cell level: Current challenges in nanomedicine area involve i) long-term fate for newly developed materials (distribution in space and time) and how to integrate already-developed nano-materials into application synergistically, ii) the niche of nanomaterials, iii)changing the general paradigm of medical practice, iv) precisely monitoring patients for preventive medicine, v) personalized medicine, vi) batch-to-batch consistency validation, vii) need for safer biomaterial, and viii) ability to target moving parts. Due to the importance of single-cell nanomedicine, this topic will be examined during the consecutive forums. (B) Sensors related to human cognition and brain research: Key technical components of human performance modification (HPM) are the nanosensors. Novel nanosensors that are capable of new functions allowing an era in HPM will be investigated. This technology includes an image processing unit and an artificial intelligence unit to name a few. With added sensory inputs and augmented sensors, ultimately HPM can drastically enhance human performance on a daily basis. The convergence of nanotechnology is likely to result in the development of novel sensor technologies that can advance in HPM including vision, audition, gustation, olfaction, and somatosensation.

"Structural characterization of protein interactions is essential for interpretation of genetic variation. A vast amount of information on single amino acid variants will be available from sequencing. The project focuses on application of computational approaches to the development of a public resource incorporating structural modeling with genetic amino acid variants and assessment of their functional impact. The resource will facilitate better understanding of principles of protein interaction and structure/function relationships. The long-term goal of this research is to gain insights into fundamental principles of molecular processes in living systems, leading to structure-based description of the cell. The collaborative project combines highly complementary areas of expertise of the US team, on high-throughput modeling of protein-protein interactions, and the UK team, on protein structure prediction and effects of genetic variation. The teams will coordinate research and training activities, based on the project, with graduate and undergraduate programs locally, nationally and internationally. Minority students and women will be involved in different parts of the research, including those within established minority-oriented programs. The project will enhance infrastructure for research and education. The US and UK teams have an extensive and well proven record of developing and disseminating public resources, used by many researchers worldwide. The project participants will be actively presenting their results at various multidisciplinary conferences and workshops. 

The project will continue development of an integrated approach to high-throughput modeling of proteins and their complexes. The objectives of the project are: (1) to develop advanced high-throughput approaches to modeling of protein interactome; (2) to provide assessment of phenotypic effects of genetic variation; and (3) to develop and implement genome-wide resource for structural characterization of interactome and phenotypic effects of genetic variation. The structure modeling approaches will be based on new search, scoring and refinement strategies, and will integrate the tertiary and quaternary structure prediction. The prediction of the mutation effect will evaluate the change in protein interactions. The genome-wide GWYRE resource will incorporate structurally refined protein complexes for model organisms annotated by the phenotypic effects of the single amino acid variants. The project outcome will have a significant impact on the research field by integrating template-based tertiary and quaternary structure prediction, and development of a comprehensive public resource for structural characterization of interactomes and assessment of phenotypic effects of genetic variation.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will provide a low-cost wearable Internet-of-Things (IoT) device for upper extremity physical therapy rehabilitation. The project will contribute to the ultimate goal of helping patients suffering from stroke or joint-related injuries of the upper extremities. The project will result in a body of knowledge that physicians can leverage. For example, Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) scores can be computed from the acquired sensorimotor information to assess the physical performance of a patient. Our innovative body area sensor network with smart glove base station (BASN-SG) design can be used to track and speed up the patient recovery process by promoting neuroplasticity through biofeedback. Thus, providing both the physician and patient a quantitative tool for upper extremity rehabilitation. Outreach opportunities will be pursued through local middle schools to use this BASN-SG technology to generate student interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) topics. The project also has a huge commercial impact and has a potential to lower the health care and labor cost associated with neurological rehabilitation of stroke patients by over 30%.

The proposed project aims to develop and commercialize a novel BASN-SG design that leverages an award winning and patent pending IoT smart glove device to measure the sensorimotor information of the human hand, which is not possible through alternative means, e.g., smart phone. Furthermore, the smart glove will be exploited for secure centralized processing of the sensitive biokinetic and physiological information that will be wirelessly transmitted from the BASN. Conducting sensor data fusion and processing closer to the body will address issues associated with signal propagation and multipath, packet loss due to signal interference and noise, cyber threats due to network attacks to foster physician-patient confidentiality, and energy consumption of wireless sensor nodes. Our research objectives includes: (1) developing a wearable exercise shirt with built-in modular wireless sensor nodes for acquiring the bio-states of the user to be transmitted to the smart glove base station, (2) algorithms on the smart glove to enable conducting sensor data fusion and processing closer to the human body, and (3) a virtual reality software tool that uses the aggregated and fused data set from the smart glove base station as an input controller for user biofeedback.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to ultimately develop a nose-on-a-chip to establish the first-ever digital database of smell. By interfacing the biology of the human nose with a read-out platform, it will be possible to decode the human sense of smell and open up new possibilities. Such a nose-on-a-chip and its associated smell database has multiple commercial applications in the fragrance and flavor industry including increasing the efficiency of developing aroma chemicals for food, personal hygiene or household use, and fine perfumes.  Also, it may be possible to identify specific malodor receptors and developing compounds that block repulsive odors or modulate olfaction (boost smell capacity and/or suppress odor cravings). In addition, the smell database can be employed to develop algorithms that predict how new aroma chemicals will smell before making them. There is an additional opportunity for the nose-on-a-chip in the healthcare industry when applied to sniff out disease-associated odors, such as Parkinson's disease. Odor-based disease detection may revolutionize biomarker discovery and may have a significant impact on R&D spending in the pharmaceutical industry and ultimately decrease treatment cost for patients.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to produce an odor-specific nose-on-a-chip assay containing a subset of odorant receptors that can report the presence of a specific odor (odor MS1) and its derivatives. This minimal viable platform is based on a well-validated need in the fragrance and flavor industry and needs to demonstrate sensitivity, specificity, selectivity and intensity (S3I) of odor activation.  The goals are to identify a set of high-affinity odor MS1 receptors, generate engineered mice for each receptor through this validated platform technology and demonstrate S3I using an established ex vivo bio-assay. Engineered mice form the basis of the proposed commercial platform. They are the bioreactors producing the olfactory extracts that are used in the ex vivo bioassay and, ultimately, are integrated with a silicon chip.  As such, optimized generation of mice is key to cost-efficient scaling of the proposed commercial chips and is a primary objective of the project. The plan is to develop a high-throughput method of generating any receptor in mice. Then, the goal is to develop an optimized gene-targeted line that will serve as a standardized template for future knock-ins of any odorant receptor gene, providing a streamlined, standardized and scalable method to ultimately establish the complete library.

"The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (HBCU-RISE) program supports the development of research capability at Historically Black Colleges and Universities that offer doctoral degrees in science and engineering disciplines. Supported projects have a unifying research focus in one of the research areas supported by the National Science Foundation, a direct connection to the long-term plans of the host department, institutional strategic plan and mission, and plans for expanding institutional research capacity, as well as increasing the production of doctoral students, especially those underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. With National Science Foundation support, Tennessee State University will conduct a project entitled ""Enhancement of Research Infrastructure for Advanced Functional Materials for Biotechnology Applications"". The vision of this project is to position Tennessee State University as a leader in the multidisciplinary field of advanced functional materials for biotechnology applications.

Advanced materials fabricated from natural products have the potential for providing novel solutions pertaining to biocompatibility, biodegradability, and environmental issues, such as food protection, time-controlled release drugs, targeted pesticide delivery, bio-inspired soil improvements, and self-sealing structures. Further, with the combination of traditional synthetic polymers, such as ferroelectric and biodegradable polymers, new and unique functional materials by design can be realized for sensory and device development. The research component of this project consists of five multidisciplinary thrusts: (a) fabrication and characterization of the functionality of electrospun single polymer fibers and assembled 2D and 3D meso-structures; (b) development of piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride nanomaterial-based acoustic mass sensing devices; (c) enhancement of functional materials using natural polymer based electrospraying; (d) production of polyhydroxybutyrate polymers from agricultural byproducts; and (e) development of bio-inspired smart infrastructure materials.

This project leverages existing resources to provide new pathways for Tennessee State University students to participate in high impact research. The project will broaden the scope of existing doctoral programs, making them accessible to students from a wider range of disciplines, and transform the program into a more comprehensive multidisciplinary research program that will prepare students for an increasingly competitive domestic and international research environment.

"The human genome is made of DNA, a language of four letters A, G, C, and T, the interpretation of which is known. This project entails ""writing"" DNA in ways that change biological function. If the workings of genomes are known and understood, then they can be ""written"" from scratch. The development of the eye is controlled by special regions of DNA called enhancers, which turn on gene activity at the right time and place in the developing embryo. The project involves writing these enhancers in new ways, to test basic knowledge of how expression of the genes that control eye development are wired. As a test of eye development, the newly written DNA is transferred to the embryos of fish or mice to observe the effects on eye development. This project is a collaborative effort between a US laboratory with expertise in writing DNA and a British laboratory with expertise in analyzing eye function. The project has broader impacts through an exchange program of scientists who are learning more about DNA writing, a scientific meeting on DNA writing, a workshop on manipulating the genome of fish, and a tailored program to teach the genomics of eye disease specifically to the visually impaired. 

The developmental and physiological regulation of human gene expression is controlled by enhancers often located at huge (100 to 1000kb) genomic distance from their target genes.  This represents a fundamental ""Rule of Life"" that is not very well understood.  What happens if enhancers are moved around?  Why are introns so huge?  What happens if regulatory landscapes are pared down to a minimal size?  What happens if the relative position, orientation, order, and spacing of enhancer sequences are jumbled?  Can they be put altogether into one big mega-enhancer?  These are all questions that currently do not have answers.  To help establish a platform for systematically answering such profound basic questions about how developmental systems are ""wired"" in the genome, a systematic synthetic genomics-based approach called ""synthetic hypervariation"" is employed. This approach allows variations to be constructed with high precision in yeast cells. The variants are precisely delivered to the native locus, preserving the genomic context that is likely critical for successfully interpreting the results. As a powerful model for studying the function of non-coding regulation and impact of its perturbation, these methods are applied to one of the most complicated mammalian genes known, namely the key gene required for eye development across multicellular eukaryotes, PAX6.   The PAX6 gene is a prime example of complex, long-range regulation in the mammalian genome. The PAX6 regulatory domain contains 31 known enhancers which orchestrate complex spatial and temporal PAX6 expression in the eye. Many of the enhancers were identified through mutations leading to the ""aniridia"" phenotype.  This project aims to obtain a more comprehensive and systems-level picture of how 31 (or perhaps more to be discovered) enhancers control this single key developmental regulator. The impact of the genomic changes are assayed using three distinct readouts: 1) zebrafish embryo PAX6-GFP expression; 2) mouse ESCs differentiated into optic cup; 3) Complementation of the mouse Sey (Pax6+/?) phenotype in vivo.

"The St. Louis region is home to many agricultural technology industries based on plant science research. These include both large companies such as Bayer Crop Sciences (formerly Monsanto) and the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, and small start-up companies. As basic research in genetics leads to the development of new technologies across these companies, current and future employees must learn new skills. Through this project, to address growing industry education and training needs, St. Louis Community College (STLCC) will develop new courses in targeted genome editing to enhance its Biotechnology AAS and Certificate programs. The project will combine academic and industry interests to develop a set of courses that will meet the high standards needed in a demanding but fulfilling field.  STLCC will collaborate with industry partners in the development, testing, and refinement of curriculum pertaining to targeted genome editing. As a result STLCC's 2-year biotechnician graduates will be able to gain cutting edge training and education, internship, and employment opportunities. These programmatic improvements will support the region's need for qualified technicians and extend graduates' employment opportunities to national and international enterprises. 

Building on the success of a previous ATE award, this project will develop a highly technical curriculum, driven by industry needs, to address the demand for mid-level technicians with genome editing bench skills, including critical downstream assessment capabilities to evaluate the success or failure of the intended genomic change. The development of these courses will benefit new students entering the Biotechnology program at STLCC and will also be available to incumbent workers in need of these additional skills to advance in their current positions. Students and incumbent workers will also gain valuable specialized training on the equipment obtained through this award. With the support of leaders at all levels of the region's bioscience industry this academic-business partnership will ensure the project's skills curriculum, and its implementation, will meet the needs of researchers and provide highly skilled, technically proficient graduates. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.

"This grant is in support of a Sustainable Urban Systems (SUS) workshop. While food waste has been studied in the scientific literature, primarily from the technical perspective, much of the existing research is fragmented across single disciplines and disconnected case studies. Modeling, managing, assessing, and replicating sustainable urban food waste solutions will require novel research approaches, organized under the principle of convergence, which deeply integrates knowledge and methods from different disciplines, and carried out through meaningful collaborations between scientific researchers and stakeholders embedded in the food supply chain. This SUS workshop is targeted to catalyze these collaborations, provide a platform of exchanging knowledge across fields, and establish a sustainable urban systems research agenda organized around the specific and compelling problem of minimizing and managing food waste for broad social, economic, and environmental benefit. A key aspect is the planned approach to capturing geographic heterogeneity in urban food waste systems and solutions, by structuring the workshop scope to consider both aggregate impact of multiple urban areas in a single state and comparative analysis of cities across the U.S. 

Efficient, resilient, and robust food supply chains are a critical part of sustainable urban systems. Knowledge created by convergent research networks can inform design of resource-efficient technologies, policies, and social interventions to minimize food waste and attendant energy, water, and resource use in cities and the peri-urban and rural regions on which they rely. Research catalyzed by this workshop is expected to generate new models of multi-scale transboundary interactions and innovative solutions for urban food waste challenges. These findings have potential for broad social, economic, and environmental benefit, and will be broadly disseminated to both scientific and stakeholder audiences. The workshop is anticipated to lead to greater understanding of how SUS science can be communicated effectively to help individuals, communities, and businesses take action to reduce their contribution to food waste. The workshop will also provide attendees with new understanding and approaches to engage traditionally underrepresented groups, particularly deaf/hard of hearing learners and scientists, in research leading to discovery and innovation.

"This project aims to build significant research capacity in Puerto Rico (PR) in the wearable technology field by forming the Center for the Advancement of Wearable Technologies (CAWT). The center will build on the research capacity developed by prior nanoscience research activities funded by the NSF Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and managed by the PR EPSCoR office. CAWT is structured around three goals: 1) advance the fundamental and applied science of biosensors, portable power and storage, and data analytics; 2) provide an engaged and diverse workforce for the nation's wearable technology sector; and 3) stimulate economic development together with PR's medical device industry. PR EPSCoR will utilize a rich network of academic, industry, and government partnerships to access state-of-the-art equipment, research opportunities for trainees and build a robust innovation ecosystem. The project will also leverage established infrastructure in PR for education, outreach, workforce development activities to make significant strides towards developing a diverse, next-generation STEM workforce that is well-aligned with the science priorities of the jurisdiction. 

PR EPSCoR will build a Center for the Advancement of Wearable Technologies (CAWT) to leverage the jurisdiction's research strengths in nanotechnology towards advancing the wearable technology field. Providing easy access to new types of wearable devices that sense and monitor health conditions and provide consistent, reproducible, and personalized medical information is essential for continued growth within the wearable technology sector. Wearable devices face three fundamental research and development challenges: 1) ensuring that functional components made of materials that are fully compatible with end users; 2) generating adequate and lasting power; and 3) updating data analytics to utilize and manage steady streams of data generated wearable devices. The CAWT motivates its research agenda by these challenges and is thus organized into three Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs). IRG1 focuses on the design of optical and electrochemical sensors, microfluidic platforms, and characterization studies of materials components that come in direct contact with biological materials. IRG2 aims to harness existing low-level energy sources to drive low-power wearable devices and investigate new multicomponent battery materials. IRG3 aims to develop big data tools to address materials design problems and support the experimental design of projects within IRG1 and IRG2. The CAWT seeks to build a research agenda that creates novel and sustainable research lines while also building up a workforce that can address needs within the local medical device industry. This project will realize PR EPSCoR's goal of building research capacity, advancing scientific discovery in wearable technology, developing a well-trained and diverse scientific workforce, and promoting economic development throughout the region.

"This project aims to lay the foundations for significant increases in global crop yields by improving the efficiency of carbon uptake in a plant. The research plan involves transferring key components of pyrenoids found in algae, into a plant, Arabidopsis, in order to improve photosynthesis. Pyrenoids are sub-cellular microcompartments that are found in the chloroplast of several algae and are involved in carbon fixation. The project consists of three aims that are each targeted at engineering one of the key components of the pyrenoid into Arabidopsis, and one computational aim that develops a quantitative model of pyrenoid function to support the other three aims. These four aims synergize to produce a minimal, functional pyrenoid in Arabidopsis. The work contributes to meeting the 2050 global food demand with minimal ecological impacts. The project trains high school, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral scientists in each of two principal participating laboratories and launches them onto the next stages of their careers. The project team is engaging industry and philanthropic organizations to facilitate translation of advances to crops. The team is sharing their research with the general public through outreach talks to general audiences at venues such as science caf's, through social media such as Twitter, and by improving Wikipedia pages. 

As a key step towards enhancing crop yields, this project aims to enhance CO2 uptake of the model plant Arabidopsis by engineering it with a minimal synthetic CO2 uptake mechanism derived from components of the pyrenoid from green algae. The project consists of three aims, each targeted at engineering one of the key components of the pyrenoid into Arabidopsis. The research plan involves (a) reconstituting a pyrenoid matrix in higher plants, (b) placing the Rubisco matrix around thylakoids containing bicarbonate transporters and (c) placing the pyrenoidal carbonic anhydrase into the thylakoid lumen. Computational methods are used throughout the project to develop a quantitative model of pyrenoid function that would drive further investigations. To support the plant engineering efforts, the investigators perform targeted research in algae and in vitro. The project benefits from an outstanding international team with a strong track record of collaboration in advancing both basic knowledge of the pyrenoid and the ability to engineer algal components into higher plants.

"This project intends to study the core enzymes that drive the production and breakdown of carbohydrates. These enzymes, called the carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes), are found in all living organisms and particularly in plants and plant-associated microbes. The complex carbohydrates found in plant cell walls are the most abundant, and renewable, organic material on Earth. If we had efficient systems to convert them to biomaterials and biofuels they would be attractive targets for bio-manufacturing projects. Important effects in the natural world are (i) the CAZymes produced by plant microbial pathogens cause plant cell wall breakdown leading to devastating crop loss ($5 billion in the United States and Canada each year) and (ii) bacteria in animal guts produce hundreds of CAZymes that digest the carbohydrates in the diet, some of which may have positive, and others toxic, consequences to the host. The research approach combines genomics and bioinformatics: the genome of a green algae will be sequenced and then bioinformatics tools will be used to carry out data analysis. This green algae is the common ancestor of all land plants, its genome compared to those of plants will show how evolution has modified core carbohydrate chemistry to meet changing environmental challenges. Bioengineering of these enzymes may well contribute to the development of a more sustainable and secure bioeconomy (e.g., bioenergy and agricultural industries) in the US, as part of the global Genomics market, whose value is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020. Students trained in the course of this project will be poised to become the next generation of scientists, able to exploit their understanding of comparative genome sequence analysis to create new understanding and novel applications. The educational and outreach objectives of this project are to engage students as active participants in the research activities, including data analysis, and to to train undergraduate students and K-12 Science teachers to understand the basics of genome sequencing and comparison methods, including hands-on skills. 


In the first Aim, new bioinformatics programs will be developed to allow in-depth CAZyme annotation with predicted biochemical activities. In the second Aim, the genomic context of CAZymes will be studied in microbial genomes and metagenomes of various ecological environments. Overall four computational tools will be developed, integrated, and delivered as a CAZyme bioinformatics web portal named dbCAN2. These free online tools will facilitate CAZyme research in various research fields such as genomics, carbohydrate, bioenergy, plant disease, food security, human gut microbiome, evolution and ecology. In the third Aim, this project will sequence and mine the genomes and transcriptomes of algae and early plants for CAZymes. This includes sequencing the genome and transcriptome of a green alga Zygnema circumcarinatum, the immediate ancestor of all land plants that is extremely critical for understanding the early evolution of carbohydrate-rich cell walls. The specific education activities include: (i) working with the Office of Student Engagement and Experiential Learning (OSEEL) of Northern Illinois University to bring undergraduate students, particularly under-represented minority students, into CAZyme bioinformatics research; (ii) collaborating with the Center for Secondary Science Teacher Education of NIU to integrate DNA sequencing and data analysis topics into the curriculum of the Teacher Licensure Program as well as the professional development programs for K-12 Science teachers; and (iii) incorporating Zygnema genome annotation as new lab components into BIOS308 (Genetics) and BIOS441 (Practical Bioinformatics).

"A major discovery of the DNA sequencing revolution is the huge number of bacterial species.  Remarkably, this bacterial biodiversity extends far below species level down to the finest scales of genetic differences.  For common human gut bacteria, people on opposite sides of the Earth may have very closely related strains, while people in the same household may have very different strains, and individuals can have multiple strains that are continually competing and evolving. For Prochlorococcus, a tiny, enormously abundant bacterium that dominates photosynthesis in the tropical oceans and fixes more carbon than all croplands combined, a bucketful of seawater includes a multitude of strains, some closely related, some very distant. The traditional explanation for the diversity of species is that each has its own ecological niche, or live in different locations so they do not compete. But for relatively simple bacteria that are mixed together by human motion and their interactions or by ocean currents, it is implausible that each strain has its own ecological niche.  Why doesn't survival of the fittest drive almost all the strains extinct? The goal of the Project is to begin to unravel this puzzle.    

This Project will bring a spectrum of approaches to bear. A major part will be developing and exploring potential scenarios for creating and sustaining extensive diversity within microbial species. To understand whether and how scenarios might work, simple models that caricature the most important features will be studied theoretically. The simplicity of models is essential. The alternate approach of making as-realistic-as-possible models and simulating them on computers is highly problematic: how could one learn which features and predictions might apply to other species?  But simple models do not mean they are simple to understand: the Project will involve developing new theoretical methods combining approaches from ecology, evolution, and statistical physics.  
 
One of the scenarios that will be explored arises from the perpetual battle between bacteria and phages -- viruses that attack bacteria.  If a phage strain effectively attacks an abundant bacterial strain, it can kill off much of that strain, leaving room for other strains to bloom, which then stimulate other phage strains to evolve to attack them, as well as enabling mutant bacteria that resist the most abundant phages to arise and prosper.  This ""Red Queen"" dynamics -- everyone running hard just to stay in place -- can cause an ecological and evolutionary chaotic state that could potentially drive and sustain extensive diversity.  

 A key part of this Project is, from each scenario explored, to glean predictions that might obtain in Nature and find ways of testing these, especially by extensive DNA sequencing.  In parallel with the theoretical developments, the Project will involve collaborations with microbial ecologists and experimenters to explore several bacterial species in depth via DNA sequencing from large numbers of single cells and from large populations of similar bacteria (and phages) extracted from natural environments or humans. To combine data of multiple types, and to extract the most significant understanding, will involve finding new statistical quantities and methods to measure them, together with mathematical analyses of the processes that might produce them. One of the important questions is to what extent the evolution of bacteria -- long thought to be primarily asexual -- is shaped or even dominated by exchange of DNA between them.  

Understanding the diversity and evolution within bacterial species that live on or in humans, or play crucial roles in the environment, is important for human health and for understanding how climate change will affect the fundamental processes that shape the oceans and atmosphere. And scientifically, diversity within a species is the root from which higher level diversity develops: advancing understanding of it will advance understanding of evolution and bio-diversity more broadly.  This Project will bring together students and postdocs from a spectrum of backgrounds, including, academically, physics, biology, and computer science or statistics.  Training them in all the needed disciplines is important for the Project's success and for the broader development of science and scientists.

"An effective response to fight the spread of a pandemic requires a clear understanding of the complex interactions between biological, environmental and human networks. The COVID19 pandemic revealed both human and systemic failures along this chain. A key takeaway was the need for timely, relevant and actionable information to support effective public messaging and policy making that can impact in-real-life  (IRL) outcomes. The COVID19 pandemic also revealed the need for  messaging and policy making at a local scale, when national- or state-level approaches might not appropriately address the needs at community scale. Frontline public health officials often had little insight into the individuals that they wished to serve. Decision makers who managed cities or school systems often relied on epidemiological models that did not account for the impact of human beliefs and in-real-life behaviors -  e.g., the willingness to wear a mask - on disease transmission. The PandEval project will address these challenges, so as to ultimately increase the trust and confidence in our public health infrastructure. If successful, public health officials will gain insight into the success of (past) messaging campaigns so that they can deliver the right message at the right time. In addition, decision makers will be able to use  the outcomes  of the epidemiological models, customized to population segments, while planning vaccine rollout, or admitting visitors to congregate living.

The innovation of the PandEval project is to rely on curating rich complex multimodal datasets. Social media-based models of community beliefs and attitudes around science skepticism, moral foundations, or the willingness to contribute to the public good, will be developed. Baseline profiles of in-real-life (IRL) behavior tracked by human mobility traces will be computed. Compartmental epidemiological models that account for population characteristics will be customized to account for a diversity of micro-targeted population segments and regions across the US. The PandEval platform will be engineered to measure the effectiveness of community targeted messaging around pandemic mitigation, including recommendations and mandates, and to measure the prediction accuracy of the customized epidemiological models. As the nation faces the potential of endemic COVID19, the PandEval project will create and curate Pand-Index, an index of online social beliefs and in-real-life (IRL) profiles at a national scale. Pand-Index profiles will help individuals to make personalized decisions about social distancing or masking versus working from home.

"Artificial and bio-hybrid (partly synthetic, partly biological) miniaturized swimming robots to navigate through the blood stream and deliver drugs have great potential in biomedicine. Viscous streaming is a phenomenon where an oscillating body generates stable, predictable and robust fluid flows that can be used to manipulate the body's local surroundings. Viscous streaming is being proposed for transport, mixing, and particle assembly, and it may be suitable for transport of mini-bots intended for applications in biomedicine. One limitation is that while streaming phenomena are well understood for simple bodies, little is known in the case of complex geometries. This proposal combines modeling and experiments to tackle the knowledge gap that relates viscous streaming to body shape. This knowledge will connect biology and robotics to enhance current capabilities of mini-bots and enables new ones. This research will pave the way to transformative applications such as localized drug delivery, precision manipulation, and fabrication. This is in line with the national need to increase medicine effectiveness as well as competitiveness in manufacturing via advanced computational methods. The proposed research has broad educational impact at the cross-section of fluid mechanics, simulations, robotics, and bioengineering. A set of outreach activities and intuitive learning modules will be designed to spark interest in fluid mechanics and engineering. A broad and diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students from different disciplines will be engaged. 

This proposed research delineates a roadmap to understand streaming beyond classic cases. The role of curvature, an aspect largely neglected, is dissected from a mathematical, dynamical and physical perspective via a conceptual framework that combines simulations, method of successive approximations, bifurcation and flow topology analysis, experiments. Then, (1) simple 2D and 3D shapes will be considered to investigate the effect of symmetry breaking, corners and variable curvature with respect to classical solutions; (2) most representative cases will be experimentally verified; (3) insights will be exploited in untethered synthetic and bio-hybrid mini-bots targeting biomedical applications. The outcome is a set of design principles captured by scaling relations, phase diagrams, and proof-of-concept demonstrations. This is complemented by methods, algorithms, software and data made publicly available to lower barrier entries, thus broadening the scope of this technology.

"Avian influenza, often referred to as bird flu, has had many outbreaks in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America in the past decades, resulting in losses of billions of poultry, thousands of wild waterfowl, and hundreds of humans. As the 1918 Influenza Pandemic revealed the potential of influenza viruses that originate in birds to kill millions of humans, prediction and prevention of the next influenza pandemic is one of the grand challenges in global health. Although significant investment and research have been made in avian influenza virus (AIV) research over the past two decades, the capacity to predict AIV pandemic is still woefully inadequate. There is an urgent and imperative need to fortify the prediction capacity, as AIV risk factors in the human-animal-environment systems (HAES) have changed rapidly in the past few decades and are expected to change at a much faster pace across the world in the next few decades. This Predictive Intelligence for Pandemic Prevention (PIPP) Phase I: Development Grant assembles a multi-institutional team to explore the appropriate pathways for establishing an International Center for Avian Influenza Pandemic Prediction and Prevention (ICAIP3). The mission of the center is to tackle the grand challenges in global health with a focus on avian-influenza pandemic prediction and prevention. The broader impacts of this project include increased international partnerships between researchers, stakeholders, and decision makers; development of STEM workforce for international and convergent research and diverse career paths; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement; and increased capacity for avian influenza pandemic prediction and prevention. 

Scientifically, this project focuses on four major problems in pandemic prediction and prevention. First, this project investigates the complex and dynamic data problem via the OneHealth (Human-Animal-Environmental Health) approach and the Big Data approach. Researchers review and assess diverse AIV and HAES datasets and identify the pathways and procedures for harnessing the disparate datasets into analysis-ready datasets for modeling and analysis. Second, this project tackles the multi-scale and interwoven model problem via the integrated modeling approach. Researchers review and assess various AIV models and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, and then identify appropriate AIV models and AI/ML algorithms for developing new integrated models to predict AIV evolution, spillover, and transmission. Third, this project assesses the decision support system problem via the structure decision making approach. Researchers review and assess various AIV decision support systems and tools (DSST), and then identify appropriate AIV DSST for further development and practical use in the AIV surveillance, pandemic preparedness, and response. Finally, this project identifies appropriate pathways to develop cyberinfrastructure for data-intensive research, communication, and sharing among the community of zoonotic infectious diseases. The center will be focused on prediction and prevention of AIV pandemic in Eurasia and its potential linkage and risk with North America.

"Chronic wounds with associated infections affect approximately 2% of the United States population, primarily in the elderly, bedridden, and patients with diabetes, and place severe physical and financial strain on those affected and the broader healthcare system. There remains an urgent need for novel strategies that enable the point-of-care monitoring of wounds to diagnose the degree of progression or healing of the wound in addition to identifying the type and severity of pathogenic infections. This EAGER award will fund a research program that will create a new optically active bandage with integrated nanosensors that detect several indicators (biomarkers) of wounds simultaneously. The bandage sensing system is inherently wireless and does not require a power source or sensitive electronics to be worn. This research will generate new knowledge, as the interactions between the nanosensors and the biomarkers will be explored in addition to the parameters of the textile synthesis process. The resulting changes in the optical signals from the textile will be correlated to biomarker concentrations. This research will be incorporated into an existing “nano-bio” outreach program that the PI runs at a local high school. Finally, this platform technology can be modified to develop wearable sensors for other important applications, e.g. sensing disease biomarkers in the sweat.

The goal of this EAGER project is to create, optimize and explore the in vitro functionality of a smart wound dressing platform for the real-time and multiplexed monitoring of wound biomarkers of infection. It is known that the presence of pathogenic bacterial biofilms can significantly prolong the healing process; however, the in situ detection and subsequent treatment of such infections is often difficult. Thus, there is an urgent need for a point-of-care wound monitoring platform that could help to decrease the liabilities associated with prolonged hospitalizations and lab testing by detecting infections in real-time and in an in situ fashion, i.e. without the need to remove the bandage. Based upon promising preliminary data obtained in the PI’s laboratory, a novel microfibrous platform is proposed for the multiplexed detection of relevant wound biomarkers of chronicity and infection. The combined analyte detection and signal transduction element is an array of fluorescent carbon nanotube sensors with engineered selectivity and sensitivity to biomarkers of chronic wounds including hydrogen peroxide, interleukin-6 cytokine, and pyocyanin toxin. Embedded within a biocompatible gauze-like microfibrous platform, in situ detection of the wound biomarkers is accomplished wirelessly (optically) with a hand-held near-infrared spectrometer device.

"Enabling real-time optimization in biomedical systems could revolutionize the existing medical technology today, allowing medicine to be more personalized and therapeutics to be more precise. Particularly, such real-time optimization is promising to enable advanced proactive treatment for stroke, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and others, with enhanced efficacy, reduced risks/toxicity, and sustaining effects over a long period. Recent advancements in bioelectronics achieved the tissue-like mechanics and miniaturized architectures to form an intimate interface with skin or internal organs, for enhanced biosensing; However, the unidirectional pathway of communications at the biotic-abiotic interface limits the device adaptability and time-dynamic optimization. Grand challenges remain in the development of an intimate electronic interface to communicate bidirectionally with biological living systems at multiscale and in a benign fashion. This proposal aims to study physical and biological communications at the biotic-abiotic interface and understand fundamental mechanisms that enable heterogeneous integration of multi-materials systems for bidirectional communications with cells and tissues. These proposed projects will enable a systematic understanding of the integration schemes, structural designs, materials mechanics, electronics fabrication, and interfacing compatibility to advance personalized healthcare with smart sensing and dynamic optimization. The proposed research pathway will lead to the design and develop a 3D bionic network as a communication portal to deepen our understanding of brain development and disease pathology, and to equip medicine with unconventional intelligence. The innovative efforts in 3D structural design and hybrid construction of functional materials will form an engineering foundation for creating cell-favored modalities of communications, which will open up new opportunities in both fundamental research in biology and clinical medicine.

Real-time knowledge of metabolic and physiological variations associated with critical diseases is essential in providing target-specific, timely, and effective therapeutic treatments. Sensing local changes in tissue mechanics, pH, and electrophysiology can serve as the feedback basis to optimize, dynamically, pharmacological delivery schedules, surgical intervention procedures, and recovery/rehabilitation protocols. However, existing biomedical systems often separate sensing from stimulation/treatment both spatially and temporally, thus leading to a delayed response to emergence of adverse events, missed opportunities for therapeutic interventions, and potential risks of side effects. This proposal aims to develop and design a bionic electronic network that relies on bio-inspired design approaches to enable cell-favored modalities of closed-loop communications with the goal to blur the barrier at the biotic-abiotic interface and ensure communication stability, sensitivity, and accuracy. Developing a multi-modality platform that integrates biosensing and stimulation at microscale, with high performance and robust operational characteristics can form a closed-loop interfacing network that enables holistic integration and communications with the biological counterpart. The bionic electronic network could be configured as an electronic implant with enhanced biocompatibility and advanced sensing capabilities, including biofluidic pressure, microenvironment temperature, electrophysiology, tissue deformation, and others. The envisioned systems aim to orchestrate sensing and stimulation in a natural and undisruptive fashion to potentially deepen the understanding of wound healing, monitor cardiovascular physiology, modulate the cellular metabolism, and eventually innovate proactive treatment.

"Flows over rough boundaries arise in many scientific and engineering disciplines including urban and vegetation canopies, maritime biofouling, additive manufacturing of flow passages, pipe transport and others. This research explores a new, accurate, general, physics-inclusive, and computationally efficient modeling framework for these flows, based on space/time averaging and attendant modeling of the Navier-Stokes governing equations. This research is enabled by proposed large scale Direct Numerical Simulations of these rough wall systems, which provide near-exact space/time distributions of model terms, thereby enabling uncertainty quantification of model accuracy. A broadly applicable Distributed Element Roughness Model, as proposed here, would be a disruptive contribution to fluid dynamics communities involved in a wide range of disciplines, including aero/hydrodynamics, atmospheric science, bio-fluid dynamics, and energy science. Also, considering that progress in machine learning has placed an ever-increasing premium on large data sets, the proposed database of Direct Numerical Simulations will enable new physics discoveries, new turbulence models, and, importantly, a significant increase in validation data, for the fluids engineering and science communities. Also, the proposed research activities will train a new generation of graduate students with experience in high performance computing, computational fluid dynamics, and turbulence modeling.

The goal of the project to explore Double-Averaged Navier-Stokes closure as a universal roughness modeling paradigm. Existing rough-wall models parameterize surface geometry/structure and are empirical correlations between these parameters and hydrodynamic/aerodynamic properties. There, physical processes responsible for the momentum loss and transport are not explicitly modeled, so these models do not generalize well to roughness geometries outside of their correlation basis. By contrast, the horizontally and temporally averaged governing equations include terms representing all physical processes present in the roughness-occupied layer, and these can each be explicitly modeled. This approach, a Distributed Element Roughness Model, is a necessary and sufficient framework for the development of a universally applicable roughness model. In this approach, models are required for the Reynolds stress, the dispersive stress, and the forces at fluid-material interfaces. In the proposed research, the PIs will explore development of such a complete roughness model, based on modeling these closure terms in the Double-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is a universal modeling paradigm, and a universal rough wall model.

"In recent decades, new infectious diseases have emerged at a rapid rate around the world—driven by climate change, urbanization, and conflict. To prepare for future infectious disease crises, there is an urgent need to devise new data-driven tools for pandemic surveillance, prediction, and mitigation. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that such tools must incorporate not only our understanding of the science that underpins new infectious diseases, but also how society’s responses to them can affect their propagation. To address this urgent need, the PIPP Phase I PILOT (Predictive Intelligence for Limiting Outbreak Threats) planning project will bring together the expertise from a wide range of relevant disciplines, including public health, clinical biomedicine, computer science, artificial intelligence, and social science. PILOT Investigators will collaborate with academic, practitioner, and decision-maker communities through multiple roundtable workshops to determine existing knowledge gaps and establish best practices in pandemic surveillance, prediction, and mitigation. This project will also engage the next generation of pandemic scholars by educating and training graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, with an emphasis on communicating science for societal impact. Students and fellows will assist the Investigator team in distilling workshop outcomes into white papers and policy briefs, which will be shared with the public via an open access online knowledge portal and virtual town hall meetings. Moreover, to enable experiential learning, members of the public will be invited to participate in a globally-broadcast, community-wide infectious disease crisis simulation. Success in operationalizing this PIPP Phase I planning project will lead to the development and deployment of a new data-driven modeling pipeline for future pandemic threats during PIPP Phase II.

The PILOT modeling pipeline will combine novel digital data sources with methods from the aforementioned disciplines to address three interconnected scientific challenges: (1) understanding and modeling pandemic potential for disease surveillance, (2) understanding and modeling the impact of interventions for disease prediction, and (3) understanding and modeling intervention acceptance (and refusal) for disease mitigation. During the PIPP Phase I planning project, progress towards the first challenge will involve determining which information sources and computational approaches should be preferentially leveraged when assessing a given pathogen’s pandemic potential at a single point in time (i.e., immediately following its emergence or re-emergence in a given context). Likewise, progress towards the second challenge will involve exploring existing knowledge gaps in simulating interventions via agent-based and game-theoretic models of multi-agent decision-making, particularly under conditions with limited information (i.e., wherein simulation-based scenario analyses may be necessary). Finally, progress towards the third challenge will involve establishing best practices for social contagion models that aim to encourage intervention uptake (i.e., with a focus on complex contagion and identification of influencers across social networks). Thus, the overarching goal of the PIPP Phase I PILOT project will be to plan for a center-scale effort by ascertaining which data types and methodological choices are most appropriate for the development and deployment of the PILOT modeling pipeline (i.e., given existing knowledge gaps and best practices). Implementation of the pipeline will be pursued in a future center-scale effort.

"Maintaining agricultural productivity in a changing climate, while also minimizing the impact of agricultural activity on the environment, is needed to sustainably meet future food demands. To achieve these goals, new tools are needed to improve the efficiency of agricultural inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, and to protect crops from extreme climate events such as heat or drought. Nanomaterials, defined as materials with no dimension larger than about 100 nanometers, are small enough to efficiently carry agents into plants, and are therefore an attractive class of materials to deliver them to precise locations in crops. Nanomaterials have been engineered to fulfill similar ‘precision delivery’ roles in other fields such as medicine. Leveraging the lessons learned from nanomedicine to create new socially responsible tools for agriculture requires discussions between multiple disciplines and between different groups in those disciplines (research, industry, and government). Therefore, this workshop planned for September 22-23, 2022 in Pittsburgh will bring together agricultural engineers, precision medicine researchers, environmental scientists, plant pathologists and physiologists, precision agriculture specialists, biological engineers, soil scientists, social scientists, and others to discuss the challenges and opportunities to create precision delivery tools for agriculture. About 50-100 investigators from the intersection of these different fields will meet to (1) create a prioritized list of the most transformative nanotechnology approaches that could be developed through cross-pollination of recent scientific discoveries in each discipline, (2) conceptualize new scientific approaches to meet these goals, and (3) create a roadmap and milestones to successful development and adoption of the technologies. The workshop will recruit a diverse group of talented junior faculty, postdocs, and students to benefit from their fresh perspectives and to connect them with potential collaborators and mentors in the U.S. After the workshop, the organizers will prepare a report and a peer-reviewed open-access “Frontiers Review” publication highlighting the key barriers and opportunities for nanotechnology to promote sustainability in agriculture.


A 2-day workshop at Carnegie Mellon University will converge people, knowledge, approaches, and innovations from disparate disciplines, federal agencies, and industry to imagine non-traditional approaches for precision delivery of active agents in plants. The workshop will leverage nanotechnology advances from multiple disciplines to discover and model underlying rules of nanoscale interactions in plants and develop novel and socially accepted nanoscale research and engineering tools for making agriculture more efficient, resilient, and sustainable, and to advance plant-based biomanufacturing methods. The workshop will allow investigators from the intersection of diverse areas of nanoscience/engineering and agriculture to discuss, among other topics: novel approaches for targeted delivery of nutrients, genetic material, therapeutics, and nutraceuticals through synthetic or biology-derived delivery vectors guided by highly selective bio-recognition molecules; the development of nanomaterials that respond to in plantae conditions of pH, temperature, redox state, and signaling biomolecules; and machine learning-based design of nanomaterial chemical and physical properties which can lead to highly precise and controlled delivery of chemicals and biomolecules in plants. Attendees will 1) create a prioritized list of the most transformative nanotechnology approaches for providing efficient and precision delivery of active agents inside plants, 2) identify novel materials and scientific approaches needed to meet these goals as well as the roadblocks to realizing them, and 3) create a roadmap and milestones for overcoming the scientific or social barriers to achieving the goals. Experts in nominal group technique will structure discussions to maximize productivity and crosstalk among disciplines. Educational activities associated with the workshop include: (1) presentations from keynote speakers highlighting state-of-the-art knowledge on the needs for innovation in agriculture for sustainability using plant nanobiotechnology/sensing, immunology and targeted drug delivery, bimolecular engineering, omics, plant genetic engineering, analytical chemistry, and computational chemistry/biology, and precision agriculture; and (2) inviting participation of 10 to 15 senior PhD students and young scientists, defined here as either untenured faculty or scientists fewer than six years removed from their Ph.D. completion. This workshop is aimed at promoting discussions and disseminating information about the potential of nanotechnology to enable precision delivery of active agents in plants. This will shift the trajectory of agriculture sustainability by improving agrochemical delivery, making plants more resilient to climate change, and improve plant biomanufacturing. This will enable future sustainable agricultural practices.

"Non-Technical Abstract
This project will develop ultrasound-sensitive nanomaterials that can be acoustically activated to deliver otherwise-impermeable biomolecules into cells with high precision. This is achieved through the rational design of fluorous phase-changing nanoparticles (PCNs), which undergo liquid-gas phase transitions in response to acoustic stimuli. While PCNs have enjoyed success as ultrasound imaging agents, their translation into drug delivery devices has been impeded by poor cargo loading and variable biologic outcomes. Building upon prior seminal work, this project will open new opportunities in the rational design of PCNs by understanding the interdependence of particle composition and tissue mechanics on their acoustic activation, and optimize the loading and delivery of biologic cargo. These objectives will be accomplished through three aims: (1) Prepare bio-inspired PCNs and identify how physical and chemical properties impacts their ultrasound activation; (2) Demonstrate successful dispersion of proteins into the liquid interior of fluorous PCNs and assess delivery under ultrasound; (3) Pair biophysical cell-based experiments with computational models of membrane mechanics to advance a more comprehensive mechanism for PCN-mediated cell permeabilization.  Success of this work will enable the design of PCNs with well controlled acoustic biophysics, yielding new biochemical tools that can be used to probe and manipulate cells within complex tissue microenvironments with high precision. Research findings from this project will be integrated with outreach activities to incorporate principles of biomaterial design and biophysics into K-12 education. Educational objectives include: (1) Examine the effect of integrating high-school students with undergraduate engineering design teams on recruitment and persistence in STEM education; and (2) Develop and implement an Ultrasound Olympics program that will provide transformative hands-on experiences to K-12 students in nanotechnology and bioacoustics. Leveraging an integrated research and outreach program, supported through rigorous and routine assessment, this project will advance new bio-nanotechnologies and improve student retention in emerging STEM fields.   

Technical Abstract
The goal of this CAREER award is to develop a framework for the rational design of fluorous phase-changing nanoparticles (PCNs) that can be vaporized by ultrasound to afford transmembrane delivery of biomolecules into cells with spatial and temporal precision. Although PCNs have enjoyed success as ultrasound contrast agents, their translation into clinically useful delivery vehicles has yet to be realized. This is a consequence of two key gaps in knowledge that include: (1) a lack of well-defined structure-activity relationships defining how PCN physicochemical properties regulate their phase-changing behavior; and (2) an incomplete mechanistic understanding of how local tissue mechanics impacts PCN biophysics. Using template-driven peptide assembly, this project will prepare programmable PCNs to elucidate the influence of particle surface tension and size on their acoustic activation, as well as identify conditions that allow protein cargo to be loaded into, and delivered from, the fluorous liquid particle core. In parallel, this project will identify how particle-cell-matrix interactions work in concert to control the biophysics of PCNs at the cell surface during vaporization. To engage and train a new generation of diverse scientists in emerging biotechnologies, such as those explored here, this project will develop and implement an outreach program to integrate underrepresented K-12 students in STEM research. Activities will include incorporating underserved high-school students into undergraduate engineering design teams, and the creation of an Ultrasound Olympics workshop to engage grade 6-12 teachers and integrate bioengineering and acoustics concepts into the classroom. By linking the proposed research program with outreach activities, this project will contribute to the development of a competitive STEM workforce capable of tackling diverse challenges in biomaterials design, molecular biophysics and bioimaging.

"Pandemics arise from the confluence of many contributing factors. These factors may be individually inconsequential but become critical when acting together, and a complex set of seemingly unrelated factors can result in a perfect storm for pandemic emergence. Yet prevailing approaches to predicting pandemic emergence remain focused on disciplinary investigations of individual or subsets of factors. Preparing for and preventing the next pandemic will require multidisciplinary approaches that leverage knowledge of complex interdependencies across scales from molecular to social and from individual diagnosis to global surveillance. This project assembles a multi-disciplinary team of scientists, representing expertise spanning the gamut from basic biology, to social, behavioral, and economic sciences, to engineering, computer, and information sciences, to focus on understanding how to identify, recognize, and predict when emerging disease threats create a perfect storm of factors that cause an otherwise localized outbreak to “tip over” into a pandemic. The project team will work together to leverage their collective diversity of expertise, experience, and perspective to innovate a collaborative framework for knitting together disciplinary pursuits into a complete, multifaceted, and predictive understanding of pandemic tipping points. Going beyond the confines of this project, the resulting framework will serve as a blueprint for all institutions dedicated to the discovery and analysis of complex linkages and thus will improve capacity to predict and prevent coming pandemics and other emergent threats to the modern world. 
 
The fact that pandemic tipping points are multifactorial makes their study fundamentally more challenging than system- or discipline-specific tipping points. The project will develop a blueprint for an institution dedicated to advancing understanding and analysis of systems with dynamics that require interrogation by multiple disciplines. The driving hypothesis for the institute is that the greatest barriers to multidisciplinary insights exist when disciplinary researchers fail to converge on shared intuition for the value other fields could provide in addressing complex research questions. The framework directly addresses this challenge by employing a Give-Take methodology: to investigate multidisciplinary research hypotheses, project teams of researchers will assemble via a bidirectional process. Researchers will identify (a – “giving”) hypotheses from other fields their own discipline could meaningfully impact and (b – “taking”) disciplines from which they anticipate useful input for their own hypotheses, and teams will include both directions of identification. This innovative framework improves the capacity for researchers in disparate fields to better recognize their interdependence and eliminates the need for researchers to understand other fields before benefiting from or contributing to investigations. The research will apply these methodologies to the complex challenge of multidisciplinary tipping points in the form of a set of case studies that will directly support our ability to address many of the complex and interconnected challenges in pandemic preparedness and response.

"Research in drug delivery by polymeric carriers is still in its infancy. The demanding challenge in this field is to find the right carrier architecture and the optimum polymer chemistry that can facilitate controlled delivery and release of therapeutic agents (drugs) to their targets. A unique carrier is invertible polymer micellar assemblies, which are formed by the rapid self-organization/assembly of polymers with alternated and repeated hydrophobic (water-hating) and hydrophilic (water-loving) segments in a rod-like shape (tens of nanometers long). Drugs and polypeptides/nucleic acids which can treat various diseases but cannot be directly introduced to human body can be incorporated into invertible micellar assemblies. Once the environmental conditions are changed (i.e., when the assemblies from water “arrive” to the cellular membrane), the invertible micellar assemblies reverse their dimensions and geometry (shape) in a smart way to effectively deliver and release cargo molecules to the targets (biological membranes) and, thus, treat relevant diseases. Although the structure and dynamics of invertible micellar assemblies have been understood to a certain level, the key questions that still need to be answered are (i) what properties of cargo-loaded invertible micellar assemblies make them efficient in treating diseases (ii) how significant is a fact of unique change of shape (called “inversion” in this project) for efficient delivery performance. Answering these questions require an in-depth understanding on the interactions between drug cargos and invertible micellar assemblies under varied environments at the molecular level, which is a challenging task because most commonly seen techniques do not have a sufficiently high resolution to “penetrate” the assemblies and probe biopolymer cargos therein. In this project, researchers from the North Dakota State University bridge this knowledge gap by labelling biopolymers and studying the behavior of the labeled sites using a unique technique known as Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy. The obtained data will provide details on how invertible micellar assemblies interact with the solvent environment and the biopolymer cargos as well as how the cargos move and/or aggregate within the interior of invertible micellar assemblies. This information  not only answers aforementioned questions but also assists in the rational design of new delivery vehicles that better adapt/deliver biopolymers and/or drugs, broadening the application of invertible micellar assemblies as general drug carriers to treat various diseases. The research team will provide training to underrepresented students including Native American students and local undergraduate and high school students on nanotechnology and chemistry. The team will also offer scientific educational opportunities for youths whose parents are deployed as soldiers through the Operation Military Kids program in the state of North Dakota.

This project aims to understand the interactions among the invertible micellar assemblies, cargo, and environment (solvent) at the nanoscale, in order to reveal the mechanistic details in the interior of invertible micellar assemblies when biopolymer cargos are loaded and released due to environment polarity changes. This goal will be achieved via three steps: (i) revealing the changes in the morphology, crowding, and polarity of invertible micellar assemblies under varied solvent conditions, (ii) depicting the impact of biopolymer cargo loading on the morphology, crowding, and polarity of invertible micellar assemblies in water, and (iii) elucidating the movement and aggregation state (if any) of the biopolymer within invertible micellar assemblies upon environment polarity change. The key to acquiring this knowledge is to covalently place an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spin probe/tag at specific locations/positions within the invertible micellar assemblies and on biopolymers, followed by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy study of (bio)polymer structure and dynamics. This research will provide maps of the local crowding and polarity within the invertible micellar assemblies under various solvent conditions and locate various segments of biopolymer cargos (connecting which lead to cargo conformation) in the invertible micellar assemblies based on the local crowding and polarity of the cargo. The obtained knowledge offers a direct connection between the microenvironment of invertible micellar assemblies and cargo structure/hydrophobicity/polarity to assess and rationalize the relative strength of the interactions between invertible micellar assemblies and cargos. This work will also use the information of cargo location and cargo movement to depict the relative position of cargos upon interacting with the invertible micellar assemblies. Lastly, this research will elucidate the possible structural changes of cargos, if any, caused by the interactions between invertible micellar assemblies and cargos. All of these efforts will result in an in-depth understanding of the cargo uptake/release performance and the interactions between invertible micellar assemblies and cargos. This project will also provide training to students at various educational levels (high school, undergraduate) from diverse backgrounds by offering hands-on research experience in cutting-edge nanotechnology, biopolymer engineering, and spectroscopy. The obtained knowledge and experimental approaches from research activities will be disseminated through scientific peer-review journal publications, national/international conferences, and local science fairs.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project includes the development of safe, effective, and affordable treatments for animal diseases including cancer in dogs. A robust immune system is critical for effective treatment of cancer.  Beyond surgery, radiation, and chemotherapeutics, new approaches include agents shown to block tumors from circumventing the body’s immune defenses. The societal outcomes of this work may include prototype and manufacturing optimization to produce biological molecules that bolster immune activity at comparatively low cost.  Like the very expensive, though effective, human therapeutic counterparts, alternative platforms can be substituted at reduced cost, making the treatment accessible to animals, improving their lives and their caretakers’ lives. Greater demands have been placed on healthcare for new flexible technologies to treat disease in a rapid and inexpensive manner. A commercial opportunity resides in providing pet owners and veterinarians an effective, economical, and safe treatment for the nearly 6 million dogs diagnosed yearly with cancer. Creation of manufacturing processes of these new prototypic therapeutics will be utilized to demonstrate the feasibility of project outcomes and contribute to the general public's appreciation of this platform in generating less expensive biologics-based therapies. 

The proposed project seeks to produce a prototype therapeutic for the treatment of cancer in dogs. As cancer is a leading cause of death in people and dogs, new technologies need to be brought forth. Development of cutting-edge therapeutics for humans and animals requires relevant and robust model systems that provide predictable outcomes. Antibodies, a proven therapeutic platform, are large, complex proteins, that are expensive to develop and manufacture. Different configurations of several proprietary subunit single domain antibodies which are smaller proteins, cheaper to develop and produce will be examined. An optimal dual epitope-binding prototype, specific to an orthologous canine target, will be constructed using recombinant DNA methods and produced in Yeast expression systems. Binding affinity will be measured by bio-layer interferometry. Feasibility testing and optimization of large-scale production will be examined, and purity and functional activity assessed. The anticipated results are that one or more of these combinations will produce a robust binding protype and thus targeting the orthologous canine molecule could provide a potent therapeutic benefit in treatment of canine cancers.

"The cell is a basic functional element in biology, and as such the cellular state is ultimately connected to every aspect in human health and bodily function. The mechanical and electrical behaviors of a cell are two basic properties that indicate cell state, and consequently are important for health monitoring, disease diagnosis, and tissue repair. A comprehensive assessment of cellular status requires the knowledge of both mechanical and electrical properties at the same time, which remains challenging because the two properties are usually measured by different sensors, while the degree of cell perturbation increases with the number of sensors used. This project aims to develop a type of nanoscale (i.e., very small) sensor which can simultaneously measure both the mechanical and electrical properties in a cell. The convergence of both measurements in one sensor will provide (1) an automatic solution to the simultaneous measurement of both properties, and (2) a means of acquiring information without introducing additional cell perturbation. This sensor technology can lead to more precise biomedical devices for disease modeling, drug screening, and health diagnostics. The interdisciplinary research will also serve as a platform for outreach and broadening participation in STEM education.

This project will investigate multiple sensing mechanisms in a nanostructured sensor to enable simultaneous mechanical- and electrical-signal couplings and transductions at the cell-sensor interface. The central approach is to borrow from structures in multifunctional biological sensory organelles to engineer a nanoscale sensor, which is expected to yield functional emulation for multi-parameter sensing. The concept of merging multiple sensing functions in one device will broaden the capabilities of general bio-interface engineering, yielding (1) a solution in synchronization and scalability for multiparameter measurements and (2) a ?2-in-1? economical integration approach important for minimizing invasiveness to biosystems. Eventually the biomimetic ?one-for-more? sensor concept will lead to efficient, parallel, and multi-thread cellular monitoring and communication. The developed sensor technology will also provide a new tool for fundamental studies in cell mechanics and electrophysiology. The research will also provide new insight on biomimetic approaches to building efficient interface to biosystems

"The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that our country desperately needs a next generation public health system that can quickly adapt to, and learn from an expected or not-expected public health crisis. By taking advantage of recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), such a system shall be able to predict, detect, and respond to rapidly evolving emergent public health crises, and resume its prior performance level rapidly in a sustainable and scalable way. Towards that goal, this project aims to tackle the grand challenge of sociotechnical design of nation-wide digital infrastructure for pandemic prediction and prevention, which is built on the foundation of privacy and inclusiveness. A multi-disciplinary team of researchers from multiple institutions will lead a broad range of fundamental and integrated research projects that incorporate both micro-level granular data and population-level data to tackle the grand challenge from different aspects. A set of activities, including meetings, workshops, and seminars, have been carefully planned to create an effective research team, to engage diverse and inclusive stakeholders (e.g., public health departments, health care/hospital systems, industrial/private sectors, and geographically and ethnically diverse community stakeholders), and to educate and train next generation researchers to conduct team science.

In order to develop a digital, autonomous, and distributed infrastructure that is also privacy preserving, the team will focus on the architecture for data storage and collection, as well as privacy enablers for data sharing. The data collection infrastructure and privacy enabler technologies will (i) carefully balance data utility and privacy; (ii) balance vulnerability for known privacy risks and institutional needs to protect sensitive data; and (iii) allow individuals (data donors) to have full control over their data and to give informed consent while sharing their data in different ways with different data collectors (researchers). In addition, the team will develop a set of highly integrated research projects that work coordinately and intelligently for pandemic prevention that also broaden participation and inclusion. The projects include (i) early detection using wearable devices in combination with population level social, economic, cultural and environmental indicators; (ii) mathematical modeling of pathogen transmission, hotspot prediction based on spatio-temporal analysis, and mitigation; (iii) multi-level and multi-faceted surveillance; and (iv) technological preparation for new diseases based on drug repositioning. The two aims are complementary to each other and work synergistically to achieve the ultimate goal of early and accurate pandemic prediction, prevention, and preparation at personal and population levels that will also ensure privacy and inclusion.

"The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project is to acquire a fundamental understanding of a genetic engineering approach to self-healing cementitious materials. Concrete and other cementitious materials are intrinsically brittle and prone to cracking under mechanical and environmental stresses. Therefore, innovative materials with the capability to self-heal after cracks formed are highly desirable in infrastructure. The fundamental insights obtained from the results of this award will advance the development of high performance and smart cementitious materials, contribute to public safety, and benefit national economy by improving the durability and reducing maintenance costs of infrastructure. The educational objectives of this project are to promote participation, especially from under-represented groups, in STEM disciplines and to increase the number of undergraduates who pursue a graduate degree. A STEM Challenge Award, as well as annual summer camps, will be designed with the goal of promoting participation from high school students from minority communities in higher education STEM disciplines.

Mother Nature has created biological composite materials, such as nacre of abalone shell, bone, and sea urchin, with unparalleled mechanical and functional properties compared to engineering materials. This is achieved in nature through biomolecules with specific structures and functionalities directing growth, microstructure, internal interfaces, and macroscopic performance of biological materials. Inspired by nature, this project aims to use a recombinant method to identify specific biomolecules that control and tune the formation, microstructure, and properties of the healing material and adapt them to the chemical and physical characteristics of cracked cementitious materials with the goal of transforming the self-healing performance. Hydrogels are polymeric gels and their behavior can be tuned in response to external stimuli. In this project, hydrogels will be rationally designed as a delivery vehicle of biomolecules to impart self-healing in cementitious materials. The results from this research will enable us (i) to discover biomolecules with specific binding to the healing material (calcium carbonate) and cementitious surfaces, (ii) to understand the effect of biomolecules on the microstructure and nanoscale binding of calcium carbonate, (iii) to reveal how hydrogels can modulate the microstructure and phase composition of cementitious materials, and (iv) to establish the relationships between biomolecules, hydrogels, and self-healing performance in cementitious materials.

"The scale and impact of epidemics and pandemics are expected to increase substantively in future years given global trends in environmental change. Pandemics are most often caused by spillover events in which viruses from wild animals jump to people and spread, quickly outpacing containment efforts. Pandemics are best contained at the earliest stages of emergence, yet major hurdles have stood in the way of early detection of pandemic threats at the scale that is needed. We set forth an ambitious scientific agenda to overcome technological limitations impeding detection and characterization of emerging pandemic threats. Our team spanning engineering, computer science, social science, epidemiology, and virology with stakeholders from public health, wildlife health, and industry is first-of-a-kind to advance predictive intelligence for potential pandemics. We will develop new disease surveillance technologies that incorporate innovative sensing, epidemiological insights, and artificial intelligence strategies, to detect what animals are present and what viruses they carry - all remotely with little human intervention. We seek to develop diverse, inclusive, and highly functional transdisciplinary research teams and trainees, to move beyond the state of the art in predictive intelligence for pandemics to inform national and global health security. 

We address the grand challenge of generating actionable intelligence for early detection of pandemic threats at the point of disease spillover from animals to people. We are planning a transdisciplinary center and associated research to advance our ability to characterize environmental change and animal-human interactions that facilitate the emergence of pandemic threats, and develop predictive capabilities in forecasting pandemic risk, to enable an evidence-base that can inform pandemic prevention. Research advances will be focused on 1) characterizing environmental conditions and the human dimensions of disease emergence, especially the animal and human movements, networks, and social systems that facilitate spillover at the animal-human interface, 2) inventing broad-spectrum sensor technologies for rapid, accurate, safe, and scalable pathogen detection tailored to a range of animals in diverse environments, and 3) improving forecasting by integration of epidemiologic and landscape data with machine learning to advance predictive intelligence. Our team will foster the convergence of creative ideas, novel approaches and technologies, transdisciplinary collaboration and communication, participatory community science, and cross-training for innovation for a profoundly diverse workforce.

"This grant will identify the mechanisms that govern mechanical behavior at soft tissue interfaces. Soft tissue interfaces are where two soft biological materials come together. These occur naturally, such as at the interface between muscle and tendon. These also occur in surgical and healing contexts, such as in focal cartilage repair. These interfaces are often spatially heterogeneous, which means that the stiffness and softness of the material varies with specific location. This has been shown using imaging techniques such as microscopy. How this heterogeneity affects the mechanical behavior across the interface is not known. When two soft tissues come together, their mechanical interactions can arise from friction, adhesion, and from the growth of new tissue across the interface. This work will first conduct experiments to measure spatial heterogeneity of the mechanical behavior at soft tissue interfaces.  The work will then build computational models to identify the mechanisms governing this behavior. The results of this research will provide new fundamental insight into soft tissue interfaces. These insights can be used to improve surgical repair of soft tissue damage and can be used to design bio-inspired soft robotics. The results from this research will be shared with the broader public at outreach events, and will be shared with undergraduate and graduate students. 

Soft material interfaces are relevant to repair and regeneration of soft tissues, and to the application of soft robotics. The phenomena governing the mechanics at soft tissue interfaces is incompletely understood. This project will use a model system of in vitro cartilage-cartilage integration to experimentally and computationally probe those phenomena. The research team will conduct experiments to quantify spatially variant displacement at the cartilage-cartilage interface. In tandem, the research team will conduct experiments to quantify the bulk behavior, frictional behavior, adhesive behavior, swelling behavior and neocartilage material behavior. Subsequently, finite element models will be generated using the quantified behavior to interpret spatially variant displacement data. Models are expected to reveal the fundamental phenomena governing soft tissue interfaces. Results from this research will be integrated into K12, undergraduate, graduate, and broader public education.

BMAT: Design and characterization of biofilm-inspired amyloid biomaterials.

Non-technical abstract

Nature produces materials with extraordinary properties, be it high strength spiderweb made of the protein silk fibroin or robust protective coat of a biofilm by fibers of the bacterial protein Curli. One of the strongest and most stable biological materials is the ‘amyloid’, which is formed from the self-association of proteins that produces densely packed, orderly protein molecules with high stability and robust material properties. The unique self-assembly processes, mechanical robustness, thermal and biocompatibility of amyloid proteins provide a rich platform for potential exploitation of bio-inspired synthetic amyloid materials for various applications. However, the relationship between protein amino acid sequence and material properties of amyloid fibers is lacking. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team with expertise in molecular biophysics, synthetic chemistry, and materials science to establish the relationships between structure, function, processing, and properties in a series of de novo peptides designed to mimic specific sequences of Curli amyloids. The fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships in the novel amyloid materials generated will serve as a platform for the development of functional biomaterials for biotechnological and pharmacological applications. As a part of this project, graduate and undergraduate students will be engaged in the research and cross-trained in faculty laboratories. Outreach efforts will be designed to engage the full diversity of Mississippi’s population, which is among the poorest in the nation and represents the highest African American population as a percentage of total population. 

Technical abstract

Although amyloids are linked to many pathologies, it is becoming abundantly clear that they also play functional roles required for cellular processes in bacteria, fungi, insects, invertebrates, and humans. In bacteria, the protein CsgA Curli forms amyloid fibers that are important components of extracellular biofilms, coatings under which bacterial colonies thrive evading various environmental insults. Curli amyloids are structurally conserved cross-β-sheet structures that accommodate tightly packed interactions to provide robust material characteristics for biofilms. We hypothesize that based on the CsgA sequence as a template, ¬¬effective variant amyloid antimicrobial materials can be designed through sequence-morphology-bioactivity correlations. The proposed research will test this hypothesis and will address the question of how type and positional biases of amino acid in the sequence correlate to biochemical, morphology, and mechanical properties of the aggregates.  These will be accomplished with two specific aims: The first aim will focus on the rational design, synthesis and biophysical characterization of peptides and peptide mimics along with their cellular and anti-microbial activities from cues derived from Curli. The second aim will focus on material properties such as morphology and nanomechanical stability, porosity, and ability to form hydrogels. Together, the proposed iterative approach will lay a foundation for designing amyloid materials inspired by Curli, based on sequence, structure, morphology, and microbial activity. This will enhance our current understanding of de novo amyloids in fundamental cellular processes and facilitate the development of biomaterials for pharmaceutical and biotechnology applications.

"This project will build new computational models for biomechanically based animation of digital humans, suitable for a wide range of applications. Beyond computer animation, the result of this research will be used for anatomy training and education by combining musculoskeletal simulations with haptic feedback. This research will also lead to novel applications in diverse other fields, including: medicine, for surgical training and stroke rehabilitation; ergonomics, for better understanding of energy use; bio-paleontology, for discovering the movement of extinct animals; robotics, for bio-inspired tendon-driven actuators; and neuroscience, for reverse engineering the brain by providing a computational testbed for understanding motor control. The integrated educational objective of this project is to use concepts from computer graphics, computer animation, and computational biomechanics as motivational tools to teach people of diverse ages and backgrounds about STEM careers.

This research will build on existing musculoskeletal simulations in biomechanics and graphics. In recent decades, two contrasting methods for musculoskeletal simulation have been developed: line-based methods and volume-based methods. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to get the best of both worlds because these methods are built on fundamentally different principles; line-based methods are built on rigid body dynamics, whereas volume-based methods are built on continuum mechanics. This project will bridge the gap between these two approaches. The specific research objectives are threefold. (1) To imbue the standard line-based methods with two important features, muscle inertia and branching. The guiding principle for this research objective is to expand the current capabilities of existing line-based methods while enabling easy integration into off-the-shelf simulators. (2) To apply intelligent model reduction that is specific to muscles, in order to make the volume-based methods more efficient and robust, and capable of gracefully degrading to line-based methods. (3) To validate the proposed computational models rigorously with real-world anatomical data.

"This project will construct robots in order to understand how animals gather information through the sense of touch and how animals use touch information to perform complex behaviors. The results will be important to both neuroscience and engineering. On the neuroscience side, the results will address how the brain combines information about movement and touch, thereby improving our understanding of stroke and brain injury. On the engineering side, the work will develop novel robots and sensors that use touch to sense object location, shape, and texture, to track fluid wakes in water, and to sense the direction of airflow. These capabilities will improve the ability of robots to work in challenging environments; for example, robots could explore dark areas more easily or provide surgeons with a better sense of touch during surgery. To train the next generation of scientists and engineers, both undergraduate and graduate students will help construct the robots and will explore industry- and government-related applications of whisker-based touch sensing. The research team will investigate technology transfer opportunities in robotics and medicine, flow sensing, instrument placement, corrosion detection, three-dimensional tactile profilometry, and compliance sensing. 

The fundamental scientific rationale for the work is that understanding how animal nervous systems process complex sensory and motor information necessarily requires quantification of the input. However, it is currently impossible for neuroscientists to record from all primary sensory neurons involved in a particular sensorimotor behavior. The three stages of this project exploit the whisker system of mammals in an endeavor to completely quantify whisker-based input and early neural processing in the rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). The first stage of work will focus on the development of modular, reconfigurable, artificial whiskers that can sense both touch and fluid flow. The materials, manufacturing, and sensor designs necessary for whiskers at multiple length scales will be investigated and signals from the whiskers will be represented based on known coding properties of primary whisker-sensitive neurons in the trigeminal ganglion (TG). The second stage of work will involve the construction of whisker arrays that anatomically match those of the rat and the seal. These arrays will be used to develop combined hardware and software models of the responses of the entire population of TG neurons. Finally, in the third stage of work, the whisker arrays will be mounted on robotic platforms, and the robots will be put through the same head movements as real animals during natural behavior. This process will allow us to simulate the entire TG neuron population response during complex, natural behaviors. Overall, the project will help unlock the basis by which low-level but powerful neural circuits confer animals with flexibility and resourcefulness in sensing and movement.

"This work will advance new knowledge of how the endocrine system of an organism converts signals from the external environment to alter traits that are expressed – a phenomenon known as phenotypic plasticity. This will be accomplished through studying a remarkable natural system, a highly social marine fish, the bluebanded goby, that is sex role reversed and capable of natural sex change as an adult. In response to status instability in their social group, these fish immediately display behavioral changes and over a few days, a complete transformation of their reproductive organs occurs. Multiple biochemical pathways that activate and/or deactivate steroid hormones can rapidly turn on to modulate gene expression so that cells and entire tissues can change future function. By combining traditional approaches and technological advances in disciplines such as analytical chemistry, bio-engineering design, and molecular biology, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of how steroid hormone signaling can regulate these complex changes. This proposal specifically merges academic trainees from the high school to postdoctoral level to create inclusive learning exchanges. Through enrolling in a multi-year course, students will work toward mentored research and educational goals where they will be encouraged to become “knowledge producers” rather than “consumers”, building a strong foundation for future scientific pursuit. In addition to building scientific literacy in the general population and rural communities, this project will directly remove barriers for exposure to science for Native American youth through education enrichment modules. 

The phenome, a set of all observable traits expressed by a cell, tissue, organ, organism, or species, is often tightly coupled via strong selection with changes in the physical and/or social environment. This project investigates mechanisms by which endocrine-network molecules transduce dynamic signals in the social environment to regulate both rapid and long-term phenotypic responses during complex life history transitions. Lythrypnus dalli are a bi-directionally hermaphroditic fish species that have environmental sex determination. Stable social groups comprise of harems with a sex role reversed male at the top of the hierarchy that provides paternal care through intense fanning and rubbing of eggs. In response to social instability, the most dominant female exhibits heightened aggression and territoriality, initiates parenting, and changes gonadal morphology. Each of the three aims of the project will address a different level of biological organization that converges technical and conceptual knowledge to study the initiation and maintenance of phenotypes in stable and sex changing fish: 1) discern post-translational mechanisms by which steroidogenic enzymes regulate sex steroid synthesis, 2) determine the steroid signaling mechanisms that regulate fin kinematics during parenting, and 3) determine the spatio-temporal patterns of gene regulatory networks. The third aim will be accomplished through a Vertically Integrated Project course wherein undergraduate students will work in small groups under peer-based mentorship to discover the anatomical distribution of endocrine and developmental genes. Access to science literacy will be enhanced for rural populations and tribal youth through innovative educational modules that address specific cultural needs of the community.

"Tulane University’s fish collection, named in honor of Royal D. Suttkus, who collected most of its specimens, is the largest research collection of post-larval (juvenile to adult-sized) fish specimens in the world, presently housing 7,407,714 specimens in 204,105 cataloged species lots.  The collection is unique among fish collections for having repetitive samples taken from the same sites over several decades and high numbers of lots with large numbers of specimens of common fish species.  Specimens from the Suttkus Fish Collection support a wide breadth of published research, from taxonomic descriptions to studies of anatomy, invasive species, community ecology, conservation, microplastics in the environment, archaeology, and machine-learning based species classification. The collection will continue to grow by 900,000 additional specimens in 64,000 lots following Tulane’s recent acquisition of most of the specimens in the University of Louisiana Monroe’s (ULM) Neil H. Douglas Fish Collection, which Tulane led an effort to rescue in 2017.  The proposed project will provide for curatorial and databasing needs of both the Suttkus and Douglas fish collections.  Students from New Orleans Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) will be recruited for internships that will involve them in the project and introduce them to careers in biodiversity research and collections care. 
 
This project will make significant improvements to the Suttkus Fish Collection, expanding the collection to a third building on Tulane’s Hebert Center campus, creating two large collection storage areas in Bunker A-2 and moving jar lots from the collection’s other two buildings to these new storage areas.  To further secure the resource, curatorial needs will be addressed for the jar lots as they are being handled and specimens and data from the Neil H. Douglas (ULM) fish collection will be integrated into the Suttkus Fish Collection.   A problem in the large-specimen facility (Bunker A-15) with alcohol evaporation due to the bins’ faulty lids will be addressed by replacing these with the 48 large new storage containers.  In addition, the Suttkus Fish Collection’s Database Management System will be updated to make it more flexible, open source and compatible with modern data access and sharing technology.  The results of the project will be disseminated to communities of interest through conference presentations, publications, and software releases. Design of the collection management system will be flexible so that it can be adopted by any biodiversity collections that want to use it.  All technology produced in the project (code, documentation and infrastructure details for the collection management system) will be shared openly with the biodiversity collections community, and specimen data will be shared with iDigBio (idigbio.org), increasing the accessibility of these data.

"As humans age, the density of the mineral content of long bones declines, and bone geometry changes so that thickness of the bone wall decreases but overall diameter increases. It is expected that local mechanical loading from habitual activity will mediate both mineral loss and bone wall changes, which should be observable in comparisons of bone cross-sectional images between different bones. This doctoral dissertation project seeks to establish whether age-related changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone wall geometry co-occur locally within limb long bone cross-sections among living adults between 40-80 years of age. A localized relationship would suggest that geometric adaptation of bone to loading persists into advanced age despite overall loss of bone mass, which has implications for the interpretation of aging from archaeological contexts as well as for prevention of age-related fragility fractures. The project supports undergraduate and graduate training and research opportunities in STEM. In addition to scholarly dissemination of results in the form of conference presentations and journal publications, this research will be presented to project participants, as well as at public research forums, community centers, and other accessible settings. 

Age-related bone loss has been attributed to a host of interrelated systemic factors (e.g., hormone decline, loss of muscle strength) and is thereby treated as a global process throughout the body. With age, bone wall diameters expand and become thinner through the removal of bone from the internal surface and addition on the external surface. The resulting expansion of bone cross-sectional diameter bolsters resistance to bending under mechanical loads and, due to roughly concurrent timing with BMD decline, has been characterized as compensatory to bone loss. Earlier in life, bone wall geometry and microstructure adapt to mechanical loading. If this ability to adapt extends into late adulthood, it is possible that age-related wall expansion and BMD decline vary locally according to typical loading patterns within a bone cross-section, along the length of a bone, and between bone elements. If, in addition to local variation, results indicate that these processes exhibit local covariation, this research can provide further support to the compensatory relationship between the expansion of bone walls and BMD decline.

"Chemical bonds between phosphorus and oxygen are important in building DNA and RNA, and also in supplying modern cells with energy. It is not known, however, whether the first life forms had the same chemistry, and early life in particular may have run on sulfur instead of phosphorus. This project will work backwards from the traces of this sulfur-based chemistry in modern life to reconstruct the role of sulfur-oxygen bonds in early ecosystems. Predictions made from this approach will be compared to the carbon and sulfur isotope record in  >2.5 billion year old rocks. We will use the astrobiology social media platform (SAGANet) for the conversations with public about this project and other studies of evolution of life on Earth.  
 
Phosphate esters, such as nucleotide triphosphates, diphosphates, and pyrophosphate, are the central component of energy metabolism in all living cells. It is not known, however, whether they were of similar paramount importance at the origin of life or in the first cells, or whether another kind of chemistry was playing the same role there. Considerations from geochemistry, molecular evolution, and systems biology imply that thioesters - high-energy bonds based on sulfur instead of phosphorus - may have supplied energy in the first metabolisms on Earth. This project will develop a broad and detailed understanding of the natural history of thioester utilization, working backwards to reconstruct ancient biochemistry from contemporary metabolism, and simultaneously examining pre-biological chemistries that can couple thioester formation and degradation. These two lines of study will allow the research team to infer the carbon and sulfur isotopic signatures of important metabolic pathways in a putative early thiobiosphere, and test whether these signatures are preserved in the >2.5 billion year old geological record. The results of this project should be of broad interest, and the project will engage with the scientific community and the public through journal publications as well as an established astrobiology social media platform (SAGANet). Select high school serving communities traditionally underrepresented in science will be reached through semester-long programs led by SAGANet graduate student mentors and facilitated by the investigators of this project.","Madison","University of Wisconsin-Madison","47.074","353276","Cross-BIO Activities","2228495","bkacar@wisc.edu","Betul","Kacar","05/24/2022","10/01/2021","07/31/2023","Collaborative Research: Biochemical, Genetic, Metabolic and Isotopic Constraints on an Ancient Thiobiosphere","BIO"
"Creative strategies are needed to manage atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) to mitigate the consequences of climate change. This research examines, through experiment and modeling, the potential of high pH algal cultures to maximize the amount of inorganic carbon (through dissolved carbon species derived from atmospheric CO2) available for conversion of CO2 to algal biomass. This biomass can then be used for other purposes, such as bio-diesel fuel. To date, high pH algal growth systems have not been adequately explored even though, at these conditions, carbon dioxide is chemically consumed at the air-water inference. To better understand the potential of the high pH/algal system, experiments and mathematical modeling of the data will be used to explore high pH/algal carbon capture processes, feasibility, and performance.  The model can be used by researchers and practitioners to estimate the carbon offsets of large-scale cultures aimed at production of high-value produces (e.g., biofuels). Through model development, the research will clarify the role of carbonate and describe how total dissolved inorganic carbon species kinetically interact during algal growth. The impacts of nitrogen-source cycling as a natural, cost-effective strategy to manage pH and improve carbon capture will also be explored. Broader impacts of the work include benefits to society by supporting climate change management and workforce development through designing algal production systems that maximize atmospheric carbon dioxide removal. This can serve as part of an integrated carbon management plan to minimize a myriad of economic, ecological and social consequences of rising temperatures due to high concentrations of greenhouse gases. To carry out the work, students from underrepresented groups in the sciences will be actively recruited. 

This research entails experiments with mixed algal cultures and the primary product will be an expanded, validated, algal growth model for predicting algal biomass production and carbon capture as a function of interconnected parameters of total dissolved inorganic carbon aqueous species availability, nitrogen source type, and culture pH. High pH is being investigated because at high pH most dissolved total inorganic carbon is converted to dissolved carbonate, whose suitability as an inorganic carbon source has received little attention. Thus, this research seeks to expand and validate a mathematical model to quantify mixed freshwater algal growth in high pH systems to inform future carbon capture experiments. The experiments will be conducted at the Clemson University's Partitioned Aquaculture System. Project goals are to characterize and model total dissolved inorganic carbon-limited growth in batch reactors through the lens of four objectives, the first being to identify and quantify the accuracy of analytical methods for measuring inorganic carbon species at high pH. The second and third are to determine to what extent carbonate kinetically impacts algal growth and determine an appropriate formulation of the Monod-total dissolved inorganic carbon-limited growth rate of mixed culture algae. The fourth goal will be to quantitatively measure carbon capture by the algal cultures in open batch reactors, data that will be used to support model validation. An additional objective will be to explore how nitrogen source cycling could be used to manage pH for carbon capture in the culturing reactor so impacts of nitrogen on pH and biomass production can be estimated and to deliver estimates of carbon capture based on several nutrient loading scenarios. During the project, a graduate student and several additional students will be engaged.

"Grzegorz Szamel of Colorado State University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop statistical mechanics of active matter. Active matter consists of objects that use energy from their environment to perform systematic motion. There is a wide range of examples, cells, bacteria, especially prepared colloidal particles, and macroscopic objects like live animals. Due to the continuous consumption and dissipation of energy by their constituents, active matter systems can exhibit fascinating properties that are very different from those of more familiar equilibrium systems. Szamel and his group will develop new methods to study the properties of active matter and will advance the fundamental understanding of these properties. Szamel's research projects will expose undergraduate and graduate students to a variety of advanced scientific methods. Szamel and his group will develop an outreach activity for high school science students focusing on the scientific and historical importance of Brownian motion, which will be accompanied by simple projects.

The description of static and dynamic behavior of active matter is an outstanding scientific challenge, which has implications for the understanding of biological systems and the design of bio-inspired materials. Szamel and his group will derive and test efficient computer simulation methods to study rheological properties of active matter. Next, they will further develop the stochastic thermodynamics of active matter. They will use it to develop feedback control protocols for single active particle engines. Finally, Szamel and his group will elucidate the importance of the long-range equal time velocity correlations, which spontaneously arise in systems of self-propelled particles without explicit velocity aligning interactions. The research activities will enhance the educational experience of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates. First, through a combination of different projects graduate students and postdoctoral associates will gain deep knowledge of both computational, simulational, and purely theoretical methods. Second, Szamel will develop a new advanced physical chemistry of soft materials course, which will become an integral part of the new undergraduate physical chemistry curriculum. Third, he will develop a capstone program in computational and theoretical chemistry.

"PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY

Nanocellulose can be extracted from all lignocellulose plants (woody and non-woody) - the largest natural polymer sources on Earth. Nanocelluloses have been shown to be excellent building block materials to form low-cost and effective water purification media, such as anionic bio-adsorbents and membrane barrier layers. The incorporation of functional metal oxide nanoparticles in the nanocellulose scaffold can create new types of sustainable cationic bioadsorbents and photocatalysts for water purification while also eliminating typical adverse effects of using nanoparticles in environmental remediation. However, there are some fundamental knowledge gaps in fully understanding the structure-property-process/synthesis relationships during the creation of hierarchically structured nanocellulose-metal oxide nanocomposites that can maintain stability and effectiveness in the aqueous environment. This project aims to investigate several fundamental issues of and provide new insights into the subject and fill those knowledge gaps. The benefits of using such nanocomposites for water purification have only begun to be realized, demonstrating particular importance as climate change has increased the frequency and severity of clean-water shortage. In additiopn to the research, a range of educational activities will be developed to engage post-doc, graduate, undergraduate (especially minority and women scientists) and high school students, in focusing on access to safe drinking water as an issue of global sustainability while learning about the fundamental concepts of sustainability and water purification.


PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY

The overall objective of this research is to understand and control the incorporation of model cationic metal oxide nanoparticles into anionic cellulose nanofiber scaffolds of different charge density and degree of fibrillation, aiming to create new functional nanocomposites from renewable and sustainable sources for water purification. The specific aims of this project are two. (1) Understand the effects of nanocellulose structure and functionality on the transport and interactions of metal oxide nanoparticles during mixing and in-situ synthesis processes in the formation of nanocomposites. Two model nanoparticle (NP) systems are chosen: (i) aluminium oxide (Al2O3) NPs with sizes in the range of nanocellulose scaffold pore sizes to explore effective and anomalous diffusion processes through the mixing approach to form stable and homogeneous composite frameworks, and (ii) “white” and “black” (low-band gap) titanium oxide (TiO2) NPs that will be formed in-situ through synthesis, and nucleation/growth processes to understand critical factors that can control the structure and properties of nanocomposites. The NP transport and formation mechanisms, as well as the resulting dynamics behavior will be evaluated against the morphology, degree of fibrillation, and electrostatic properties of the nanocellulose scaffolds. (2) Develop advanced characterization and modeling techniques that can reveal the structure-property-processing relationships during nanocomposite formation. The primary processing-structure characterization methods will include shear-free mixing combined with in-situ scanning small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS), and other spectroscopic techniques using synchrotron radiations, while the performance evaluation will be focused on adsorption of anionic contaminants (e.g., fluorides and nitrates) and photocatalytic degradation by solar radiation.

"Plasma is the most abundant form of matter in the observable universe.  Plasma Science and Engineering (PSE) translates advances in fundamental plasma science to technologies that address society’s needs.  This Future Technologies and Enabling Plasma Processes (FTPP) project will develop future transformational technologies enabled by PSE, including the design of novel materials, agricultural applications, sterilization, food safety, and space weather forecasting. The proposed foundational plasma research will incorporate the complexity of particle kinetics and energy flow into theory, models, and experiment.  This will lead to better understanding, diagnosis, modeling, and control of these processes in pursuit of transformational technologies.  The project integrates components of experimental and theoretical plasma research to create a diverse and skilled workforce to strengthen PSE capacity in the state.  FTPP will be administered by the University of Alabama in Huntsville in collaboration with nine other institutions: Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Alabama State University, Auburn University, Oakwood University, Tuskegee University, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Alabama Tuscaloosa, and University of South Alabama. The Computational Fluid Dynamics Research Corporation will partner with the project to advance plasma technologies for materials processing, aerospace, electronics, and energy applications.

The vision of the Future Technologies and Enabling Plasma Processes (FTPP) project is to: 1) develop transformative technologies in hard and soft (or bio-) materials, food safety and sterilization, and space-weather prediction; and 2) build capacity in Plasma Science and Engineering (PSE) research and its supporting workforce, making Alabama a world-renowned hub for PSE.  Foundational plasma research will incorporate the complexity of particle kinetics and energy flow into theory, models, and experiment to understand: 1) energy transfer from electromagnetic fields to plasma species mediated by collisions and collective processes (e.g., turbulence, self-organization); and 2) the transfer of energy and momentum from large-scale flows and magnetic fields to the creation of highly energetic particles in laboratory, ionospheric, magnetospheric, solar, and heliospheric environments.  These foundational research activities in PSE will enable future transformational technologies including: 1) data-driven approaches in plasma-synthesized, high-entropy, and quantum materials (addressing two of NSF’s 10 Big Ideas, “Harnessing the Data Revolution” and “Quantum Leap”); 2) plasma-processed polymer composites from waste materials; 3) surface-modified biomaterials with antimicrobial properties and plasma-treated seeds with increased yield potential; 4) food safety and sterilization; and 5) space-weather fore/nowcasting to predict the geospace radiation environment and protect space-based technologies.  The requested resources and activities of the project will establish and strengthen collaborations among academic institutions and industries, thereby enhancing the research and education capacity for the advancement of low-temperature-plasma science and technology across the state. The core research program is well integrated with education, workforce development, and diversity plans that span academic, public, and private sectors.

"Research on the evolution of human skin pigmentation includes the characterization of this characteristic's underlying genetic variation. Recent studies have shown that the number of genes associated with skin pigmentation differs across populations and that much of this genetic variation is still unidentified due to underrepresentation of some populations in human genetic research. This doctoral dissertation project lays the groundwork necessary to model human skin pigmentation evolution by characterizing and functionally validating the genetic architecture of skin pigmentation in a population that has been underrepresented in such research. Data generated from this project can inform several pigmentation research objectives, including understanding the role of natural selection in shaping this human trait. The project can also be used as a model for research on other complex genetic traits and may inform other fields including bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology. Additionally, this project contributes to the skill development of undergraduate and graduate students through wet lab, computational, and fieldwork training.

The research team conducts fieldwork to collect paired genetic and pigmentation data from individuals in a population with high levels of ancestral alleles and higher levels of genetic diversity than other extant human populations. The research presents an opportunity to research pigmentation variation that may have been present in ancestral human populations, and therefore potentially broadens our understanding of pigmentation genetics globally. Newly collected samples will be genotyped and then evaluated using a genome-wide association (GWA) approach. Data from four different descent populations will be meta-analyzed to increase power to detect low-effect size loci. Regions identified in the GWA study are not necessarily causal pigmentation loci, rendering functional validation necessary. Top candidate genes are therefore identified and functionally evaluated for causality with CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) gene editing in zebrafish, an effective model organism to study human skin pigmentation. Using a rapid automated phenotyping platform to image larvae, pigmentation is analyzed comparing CRISPR- mosaic “knockout” fish with “mock” injected sibling controls. This strategy can functionally verify whether novel associated genes from the GWAS are causal pigmentation genes.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of reproducible synthetic substrates for the pluripotent stem cell market. This technology may provide a stem cell researcher with the ability to grow cells on a substrate and more readily replicate the results with the assurance that the cells can be safely delivered to patients. This method may produce new treatments for chronic diseases in patients while decreasign the time to governmental approvals for the therapeutic uses of stem cells. Current substrates vary from batch to batch due to the nature of their derivation, but the proposed technology seeks to produce the same substrate over and over, with minimal variation, providing reproducibility. This reproducibility may generate treatments to help millions of individuals.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a synthetic substrate and method that is reproducible, is eady to use, reduces the time to effective treatment, and sustains the derivation and long-term culture of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in an undifferentiated state without genetic abnormalities and equal genetic profile. The interest in the public and private sector in producing hPSCs at a large scale has grown significantly due to the potential benefits that these cells bring to regenerative medicine. However, stem cell translation from the laboratory to medical applications has been slow because the substrates used for growing the cells are not xenogenic-free (xeno-free), not reproducible, and not chemically defined; This results in cultures with non-consistent quality. The goal of this project is to resolve this problem in the stem cell ecosystem. The proposed substrate allows the growth of hPSCs in a xeno-free and defined environment with high reproducibility resulting in methods which may save time and effort. If succesasful, academic stem cell research labs, clinical labs, bio-banks, pharmaceutical manufacturerers, and bioengineering companies will be certain that they are producing cells free of any cross-contamination and ready for direct use in regenerative medicine.

"The current challenges of dependence on non-renewable fossil sources to generate the chemicals and materials that humans depend upon, along with the energy- and carbon-intensive processes that transform them, motivates the development of new approaches to convert renewable feedstocks to useful products.  Advances in biotechnology have resulted in substantial growth within the methodologies and commercial activities that comprise the Bioeconomy, including those with a focus on the conversion of sustainable feedstocks.  However, it remains the case that the costs of many bio-based products are not sufficiently competitive to displace fossil-derived counterparts.  It is also true that the scope of products accessible through biological production is frequently constrained by the sensitivity of commonly-used microbes to the compounds that are desired to be produced.  Finally, because contamination is a significant concern, bioprocesses are usually operated in batch or fed-batch mode, while chemical processes benefit from the productivity advantages inherent to continuous production.  This project focuses on the development of a particular organism that displays an unusual set of physical characteristics to help addresses these challenges.  The microbe is capable of growth in a two-phase system that includes supercritical CO2 (scCO2), which is a preferential solvent for many toxic products as well as inhibits growth of most organisms.  This secondary phase should both protect the microbe from high concentrations of the product through continuous withdrawal, and minimize the risks of contamination.  This research project will result in greater understanding of the behavior of this organism, an increase in genetic engineering tools, and a streamlined strain, all of which will lead to new opportunities for integrated bioprocess operations, which couple production with extraction.  The work will enable the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers as well as research exchanges between the collaborating institutions.  New content will also be introduced into an experimental laboratory curriculum.

The goal of this project is to elucidate the genotype-phenotype relationship of tolerance to scCO2 of the chosen microorganism using a reduced genome approach.  The objectives include the determination of gene essentiality using transposon libraries, development of robust tools for genome-scale engineering of the organism, and construction of a minimal genome strain for use in bioproduction.  Transposon libraries will be constructed for both gene knockouts (i.e., complete elimination of associated enzyme activities) and overexpression, and the resulting libraries will be assessed to establish essentiality of gene sets under different environmental conditions.  Transcriptomic (RNA sequencing) and translatomics (ribosome profiling) studies will be performed on library members to understand systematic biological responses to changes in culture conditions at the molecular level.  The associated data will also be used to mine and design new bioparts to expand a toolbox for genetic engineering.  Lastly, a reduced genome strain displaying the desired tolerance phenotype will be constructed and engineered to produce target compounds, with these strains evaluated relative to the wild-type predecessor.  This project will provide deeper understanding of tolerance to toxic solvents and provide a workflow for assessing these complex phenotypes.  It is the next step in a long-term effort to introduce new, non-model organisms that are inherently advantaged for bioprocessing, with the ultimate goal of advancing a robust, sustainable Bioeconomy.

"The gut microbiome – the term used to refer to the collective community of microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tract – is a key player in the creation and use of energy for the host. Studies show that disrupting the course of development of the gut microbiome with antibiotics can increase body fat and the linked risk of obesity and disease later in life. These effects can differ between females and males.  This doctoral dissertation research investigates how antibiotic use causes increased body fat, frames this effect in an evolutionary context, and examines why sex differences in this effect arise. Combining these areas of focus allows this investigation of cause-effect relationships important for understanding how factors experienced in early life impact health outcomes later in life, and in addition to the potential to inform public health research, the results speak to larger theoretical frameworks in biological anthropology.  This research provides intensive training for a female graduate student and opportunities for undergraduate students, particularly members of groups currently underrepresented in STEM fields to gain robust research experience. 

Environmental adversity during early life can cue developmental changes in young animals that promote metabolic diseases in adults such as obesity. The gut microbiome plays critical roles in the regulation of host energy balance, with disruption of the gut microbiome through antibiotic use causing short-term weight and fat loss. Notably, despite short-term energy losses, exposure to antibiotics in early life has been linked to obesity and overweight in adulthood in humans, mice, livestock, and other animals. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying these long-term obesogenic effects remain unclear. The investigators hypothesize that gut microbiota depletion during the critical period of early life constrains energy budgets, necessitating energy allocation tradeoffs that persist in adulthood at the cost of fitness. To test this hypothesis, the investigators profile the gut microbiome and host energy allocation over the course of development in a conventional mouse model of early-life antibiotic treatment, followed by direct evaluation of immune and reproductive fitness in adulthood. The proposed study provides novel evidence linking disciplines concerned with the developmental origins of health and disease to those concerned with the gut microbiota and host-microbial interactions. The results of this research contribute to theoretical discussions regarding trade-offs following early life influence and illuminates the factors contributing to rising rates of metabolic diseases across the globe.

"The honeybee comb is a masterpiece of distributed architecture. This wax-made storage structure, which is essential to the survival of the colony, is constructed in a near-optimal manner that minimizes the wax-to-storage space ratio, due to the high energy cost associated with wax production. Honeybees construct the comb with remarkable precision, regardless of irregular boundaries or unevenness of the surface on which they work. Yet the mechanisms by which honeybees adapt their construction to the constraints of the environment (e.g., a pre-existing cavity in a tree) are poorly understood. The goal of this project is to shed light on the process of comb construction by framing it as a pattern formation process, which allows us to leverage the similarities between comb structure and the structure of non-living materials such as crystals and graphene. This project bridges tools from multiple disciplines, bringing insights from animal behavior and crystallography. The outcome of this research is a novel framework for modeling the collective behavior of honeybees as well as quantitatively describing the geometry and topology of the honeybee lattices. This project will not only help us understand the collective behavior of bees, but will also help leverage that understanding to create bio-inspired system designs in the fields of swarm robotics, collective construction, and lightweight cellular structures.
                                               
                   
This research project will address three specific questions: (1) Are the irregularities in the honeycomb structure the result of global planning that accounts for distant frustration sources (e.g., solid boundaries of a tree cavity) or a local reaction to the immediate surroundings of a given cell? (2) Can the honeycomb pattern be explained as the result of an energy minimization process, and if so, are the solutions comparable to patterns consistently found in a diverse range of self-organized crystallographic systems under geometric frustration (e.g., colloidal crystals or graphene)? (3) To what extent is the optimality of the solution to the geometric problem of comb construction modulated by large-scale changes in the environment, such as engineered boundaries, various given cell sizes, or curvature? The investigators in this project will use 3D-printing to construct precisely controlled and quantified honeycomb foundations, which can be used to introduce systematic and repeatable sources of geometric frustration in the experiments. The final comb structures will be imaged and analyzed (computer vision techniques, x-ray microscopy) to precisely characterize the geometry of individual cells and the topology of the global lattice. This rich information set will be used to develop and validate data-driven agent-based models to explore possible underlying mechanisms of collective comb construction. The approach followed in this project goes beyond the traditional view of collective behavior as stigmergy -- wherein organisms respond to local cues with little or no long-range effects -- to explore the influence of long-range interactions that are physically mediated.

"The Oregon State Arthropod Collection (OSAC) at Oregon State University is the largest insect collection in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), and houses about three million specimens. These specimens serve as the basis for insect diversity research in the PNW and additionally provide valuable information and reference material for regional stakeholders in forestry, agriculture, and conservation. This project installs a compactor system and new cabinets for the OSAC, taking advantage of a full building remodel, and completing OSAC’s transition into a modern, secure repository that will enable fifty years of research, growth, and active engagement with diverse communities. This project will also rehouse and improve several portions of the collection, thereby removing substantial infrastructural constraints impeding curation and research. Students, including those in groups underrepresented in STEM, will participate in this reinvigoration of the OSAC through these curatorial projects and through assisting in the creation of public displays about the collection and its specimens.

The project will install nineteen movable carriages, allowing OSAC to be housed in our newly renovated repository room. Curatorial projects will focus on ground beetles, brush-footed butterflies, true bugs, and true flies, and will result in their being rehoused in new cabinets, drawers, and unit trays. The entire collection will be deep-frozen as part of the project, and a new specimen-handling workflow developed, eradicating pest challenges that have historically plagued the collection. A series of community museum events, student curatorial projects, and an undergraduate course, will engage students and the public with the collection in an innovative story-telling approach whereby participants are encouraged to explore and be inspired by the multifaceted information associated with museum specimens.

"This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2022, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Some of the largest creatures on the planet (whales and sharks) are filter feeders. Interestingly, filter feeders with enormous body sizes have evolved numerous times. This research seeks to explore the functional performance of oral filters in baleen whales and basking sharks. Both lineages filter using bristle-like filters composed of mineralized keratin to capture small prey items from the water. Baleen whales and basking sharks provide invaluable test cases for understanding the relationships between body size and foraging strategy. This work will provide new insights into the physiology of ecologically important and endangered animals.

The work represents an integrative approach using engineering, physics, and biology to identify the filtration mechanisms used by giant bristle-filter feeders. The project will investigate the filter performance by performing a hierarchical investigation, beginning with detailed anatomical descriptions. Based on the filter anatomy, the fellow will perform investigations to identify the flow around the filter and the mechanisms and performance of the filter. This will provide critical information for bio-inspired designed efforts which have the potential to lead to major advances in industrial filtration systems. Furthermore, these tests will clarify why the biggest vertebrates to have ever lived are filter feeders and will provide insight into their role as ecosystem engineers. Taken together, these proposed studies will deliver key insights into the convergent evolution of massive filter feeders.

"This is a collaborative research project between the SETI Institute, San Jose State University, PCOM Georgia, and Georgetown University to study proteins from ‘extremophiles’.  These are organisms that can thrive in extreme environments, such as low temperature (<0°C, ‘psychrophiles’), high temperature (>100°C, ‘hyperthermophiles’), or high pressure (>1100 atm, ‘piezophiles’), as well as other extremes of pH, salt concentration, and radiation.  Understanding how living things can flourish under extreme conditions is important for guiding the search for life elsewhere in the universe.  It also has many practical applications, since the enzymes from these microorganisms, ‘extremozymes’, are extraordinarily useful. Their stability under extreme conditions has enabled numerous applications, such as enzymes included in cold-water ‘biodetergents’, high temperature ‘bio-pulping’ enzymes for more eco-friendly paper-processing, and high-pressure enzymes for food processing.  Despite their numerous applications, the factors that lead to extremozyme stability are still not completely understood.  Some theories propose that the molecular motion within these proteins determines the ranges of stability and activity.  However, there is not enough good quantitative information about extremozyme motion under different conditions.  For this project, proteins from various extremophiles will be produced by undergraduates at San Jose State and PCOM Georgia.  The motion in these proteins will be measured by SETI scientists using novel x-ray techniques.  The results will be tested against theoretical calculations by graduate students at Georgetown University.  Underrepresented high school and undergraduate students from local schools will be involved in field trips and summer research projects.

This project is undertaken to gain experimental data on atomic motion in proteins from psychrophiles to hyperthermophiles and from mesophiles to obligate piezophiles, under a range of temperatures and pressures.  Experiments performed by using nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) will provide information on motion of Fe atoms at the active sites of rubredoxin and cytochrome P450 and Te atoms in the middle or on the periphery of the target proteins. X-ray diffraction and nuclear resonant time domain interferometry (NR-TDI) will quantify motion in polypeptide helices and loops of these proteins. The data will test two hypotheses concerning protein dynamics.  The project will specifically look for ‘protein glass transitions’, which are proposed Temperature-dependent changes in protein flexibility over the range of 180-220 K.  The project will also test the ‘corresponding states’ paradigm, which says that proteins in an extremophile have been adapted to maintain equivalent flexibility under the different environmental conditions favored for each organism. Finally, the project is aimed to determine the best combination of force fields and water models for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reproduce and interpret the experimental data collected for a set of proteins. This research is expected to expand the knowledge of molecular motion in extremophile proteins and the fundamental factors that contribute to life under extreme conditions. This project was funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.

"This project augments the Chrono computer simulation platform in transformative ways. Chrono's purpose is to predict through simulation the interplay between mechatronic systems, the environment they operate in, and humans with whom they might interact. The open-source simulation platform is slated to become a community-shared virtual investigation tool used to probe competing engineering designs and test hypotheses that would be too dangerous, difficult, or costly to verify through physical experiments. Chrono has been and will continue to be used in multiple fields and disciplines, e.g., terramechanics, astrophysics; soft matter physics; biomechanics; mechanical engineering; civil engineering; industrial engineering; and computer science. Specifically, it is used to engineer the 2023 VIPER lunar rover; relied upon by US Army experts in evaluating its wheeled and tracked vehicle designs; used in the US and Germany in the wind turbine industry; and involved in designing wave energy conversion solutions in Europe. Upon project completion, Chrono will become a simulation engine in Gazebo, which is widely used in robotics research; operate on the largest driving simulator in the US; empower research in the bio-robotics and field-robotics communities; and assist efforts in the broad area of automotive research carried out by a consortium of universities and companies under the umbrella of the Automotive Research Center. The educational impact of this project is threefold: training undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students in a multi-disciplinary fashion that emphasizes advanced computing skills development; anchoring two new courses in autonomous vehicle control and simulation in robotics; and broadening participation in computing through a residential program on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison that engages teachers and students from rural high-schools. 

Innovation and discovery are fueled by quality data. At its core, this project seeks to increase the share of this data that has simulation as its provenance. In this context, a multi-disciplinary team of 40 researchers augments and validates a physics-based simulation framework that empowers research in autonomous agents (AAs). The AAs operate in complex and unstructured dynamic environments and might engage in two-way interaction with humans or other AAs. This project enables Chrono to generate machine learning training data quickly and inexpensively; facilitates comparison of competing designs for assessing trade-offs; and gauges candidate design robustness via testing in simulation of corner-case scenarios. These tasks are accomplished by upgrading and extending Chrono to leverage recent computational dynamics innovations, e.g., a faster index 3 differential algebraic equations solver; a new approach to solving frictional contact problems; a real-time solver for handling flexible-body dynamics in soft robotics via nonlinear finite element analysis; a best-in-class simulator for terradynamics applications; reliance on just-in-time compiling for producing executables that are both problem- and hardware-optimized; a novel way for using mixed data representations for parsimonious storing of state information; and a scalable multi-agent framework that enables geographically-distributed, over the Internet, real-time simulation of human-AA interaction.

"Unsteady flows in natural and engineering systems, such as in the ocean and in industrial processes, play a fundamental role in the transport and mixing of submerged particles and chemical substances. Transport barriers organize flows into distinct regions with large scale coherent structures, and, thus, control the mixing of passive particles and substances. For example, transport barriers can be exploited to predict oil spill patterns. However, less is known about how these transport barriers affect the transport and mixing of active matter and vice-versa. Despite evidence that aquatic organisms, such as fish schools and phytoplankton, could affect transport in the ocean, a systematic understanding of the interplay between activity and transport barriers is lacking. Such understanding is crucial for controlling active matter in unsteady flows, with the potential to impact application areas ranging from aquatic ecology to bio-inspired designs. This award will support research to advance our knowledge of the interplay between active matter and transport barriers. 

In order to reveal the two-way coupling between transport barriers and active matter, the PI will conduct experiments in electromagnetically driven laboratory flows with light-guided brine shrimp (Artemia salina). The research plan is structured around two aims: (1) to determine the non-dimensional groups that are most relevant in the coupling of active matter and large scale transport barriers, and divide the corresponding high dimensional space spanned by the non-dimensional groups; (2) to understand how small length scale in active matter percolate through scales to modify the large length scale transport barriers. The results of this research will pave the way for implementable control strategies of active matter in real-world scenarios.

"With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor YuHuang Wang of the University of Maryland College Park will address the synthetic challenge of the controlled placement of organic color-centers, also known as quantum defects, on the surface of single-walled carbon nanotubes.  These atomic defects can emit photons—the elementary particles of light—one at a time, creating a source of single photons; however, they typically exist randomly within the solid, lacking the synthetic control required for achieving control over atomic structure, placement on the surface and color tuning.  Controlled placement of organic color-centers on the surface of single-walled carbon nanotubes would enable the nanotubes to emit single, short wave infrared photons at room temperature.  Success in accomplishing the objective of the project would enable the creation and tuning of identical organic colo- centers emitting single wavelengths for emerging applications in bio-imaging, molecular sensing, and quantum information science.  In addition to the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students, particularly from under-represented groups, in cutting-edge research, the project will also involve developing engaging nanoscience and technology demonstrations based on project results and sharing these with others in community outreach events.  

In this project, Professor Wang and his team will synthesize model defect color-centers by covalently attaching small functional groups to semi-conducting carbon nanotube hosts using organic chemistry. When the nanotube is excited, the resulting excitons—or electron-hole pairs—are harvested by the organic color-center to produce bright shortwave-infrared single photons whose “color” sensitively depends on the atomic configuration of the defect site. The team will use this optical fingerprint to study how these organic color-centers can be generated, erased, or corrected on the carbon lattice of the nanotube semiconductor using light. This work, if successful, will pave the way to attaining  atomic control and deterministic placement of these defect color-centers. The team will also work to advance a method to enable tracing of dark excitons and quantification of the exciton-to-photon conversion efficiency at the defect—a property of fundamental importance to quantum light sources and to the understanding of the excited states of these nanostructures.

"With the support of the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms B (CSDM-B) program in the Division of Chemistry,  Anne E. V. Gorden of Texas Tech University, Ana de Bettencourt-Dias of the University of Nevada, Reno, and Jorge Monteiro of California Polytechnic State University-Humboldt will study lanthanide complexes with erbium, ytterbium, and neodymium to develop new compounds that have the potential to display efficient upconversion emission both in the solid state and in solution. In two-photon upconversion, light of lower energy non-destructive wavelengths, such as infrared light, is converted to higher energy emission in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum through a materials-excitation mechanism. The development of these new metal complexes as water-soluble compounds is expected to enable their application as new luminescent probes for bio-imaging of cells in real time without the need to employ damaging, high-energy radiation. In the long term, such studies have the potential to open up new vistas for biomedical science, by providing enabling tools to study processes in cells and biological tissues without perturbing the biology. Such complexes might, for example, provide a new means of analyzing metabolic processes or the reactivity of metalloenzymes in living tissues, thereby introducing new readouts for both healthy cell biology and dysfunctional cell biology, as a possible diagnostic tool.

While selected examples of Ln(III)-upconversion emission in the solid state exist, the parameters for efficient upconversion emission in solution are not well established. To probe these parameters, the Gordon research team will isolate multi-metallic Ln(III)-ion complexes with water-soluble naphthylsalophen-based ligands and pre-organized supramolecular structures and characterize their photophysical properties. Ln(III)-ions have characteristic line-like spectra with long-lived emission, which can be easily distinguished from background fluorescence. Importantly, toxicity and low cell penetrability are not inherent concerns with Ln(III)-complexes and the emission properties of these complexes are not dependent on their crystalline phase. To realize upconversion emission, a combination of Yb(III) and Er(III) or Nd(III) and Er(III) in the complexes is needed, requiring careful balance of the necessary stoichiometry. Using judiciously designed systems, Dr. Gordon and her team will tune the properties of the Ln(III)-ion complexes for improved solubility, biocompatibility, and photophysical properties. Optimally, such probes should be water-soluble, display high emission efficiencies at emission wavelengths that are easily discriminated from tissue and cell fluorescence, and should be excited at wavelengths that are not absorbed by or damaging to biological tissues. This work is expected to contribute to better understanding of the  structure-luminescence relationship that leads to increased upconversion emission in the solid state and in solution.  The insights gained from this work have the potential to help guide the design and development of effective new luminescent probes, ultimately for applications in biological imaging.

"Additive manufacturing (AM) of thermoplastics serves a large and growing market to produce parts for industries such as consumer electronics, automotive, aerospace and medical, etc. As the demand continues to increase, there is a need to advance the science of AM to create processing and materials that not only achieve a balance of performance, efficiency and cost, but especially also address impacts on the environment. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research into novel AM processes combining sustainable plastic composite blends with thermally-protected biological components and electrically conductive fillers. The approach will leverage innovations in microfluidic print technologies, which enable precise thermoplastic processing of materials to combine a variety of unique material properties. Once completed, the project will inform materials selection for a variety of performance-driven applications, accelerating widespread adoption and commercial viability of such materials as degradable-by-design plastics and environmental sensors. At its central effort, this project will establish education and outreach activities for a variety of student groups, including those historically underrepresented in these areas of research. In particular, this project will develop interactive hands-on three-dimensional printing experiences for rural high school and tribal college students and integrate additive manufacturing research of sustainable, hierarchical polymers into curricula at Montana State University.

The overarching goal of this interdisciplinary research, integrating manufacturing, materials science and chemistry, is to enable novel multi-material thermoplastic composite structures that incorporate functional biologics, such as enzymes, and electrically conductive fillers. There are two research thrusts in this CAREER endeavor. The first is to understand the conditions needed to create additive manufacturing filaments that can successfully encapsulate heat-sensitive biologically derived enzymatic constituents, such that their biological activity is substantially retained upon thermoplastic processing into final composites. The amount of thermal shielding will be quantified by analyzing the environmental degradability of complete composite samples manufactured via microfluidic controls of material extrusions through custom-design print-heads for fused filament fabrications. The second thrust is to explore the processing and properties of electrically-conductive components using the developed methods to hierarchically structure multi-material systems. An innovative microfluidic technique, based on combining materials with precise local structural and thermal control through engineered AM print-heads, will be utilized to better understand the required process conditions. Further, topology optimization and microfluidic modeling will be used in conjunction with experiments to determine processing parameter space. The culmination of these two research efforts will be a successful demonstration of an additively manufactured bio-based passive sensor that biodegrades in response to humidity. This project is jointly funded by the division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"Among the notable “shoulders of giants” on which present-day botanists stand are those of Dr. Sherwin Carlquist (1930–2021). Carlquist leaves behind a rich legacy and significant collections resulting from over 30 years of important botanical research. Over the course of his distinguished career, Carlquist published prolifically, with over 300 research papers covering such topics as plant anatomy and systematics, evolutionary and ecological theory, flower development, morphology, island biogeography, and taxonomy. As a researcher, Carlquist considered the biological elements within an environment as comprising a dynamic network. This network informed his method for collecting specimens and the rich array of materials and records he generated through that practice. The Carlquist Collection, housed at the California Botanic Garden Herbarium (RSA) and the Botanical Research Institute of Texas Library (BRIT), collectively contains 191,789 objects, including herbarium specimens, wood specimens, plant material preserved in spirits, wood anatomy microscope slides, field photograph transparency slides, black and white photographs, and field collection notebooks. A significant portion of the Carlquist Collection has never been curated or digitized, making much of the collection inaccessible. Further, some of the collection materials have faced varying degrees of deterioration owing to inadequate housing in non-archival materials. In a collaborative effort between RSA and BRIT, this project aims to curate and digitize these important collections and their associated data to provide long-term preservation and to create an Extended Specimen Network (ESN), wherein Carlquist’s specimens, field photographs, and collection notebooks will be linked to form an aggregated collection, thus creating limitless additional preparations and digital resources. The project will facilitate immediate application to a suite of research areas, including systematic, wood anatomy, ecology, biogeography, island biology, phenology, plant conservation, history of science, plant humanities, and archival theory and practices. The Carlquist Collection will be publicly available via online data portals.

Held at the Herbarium at California Botanic Garden (RSA) and the Library at the Botanical Research Institute of Texas (BRIT), the Sherwin Carlquist Collection encompasses more than 30 years of botanical field research comprising 30,770 biological collections and 161,019 archival objects. This project aims to (1) curate the Carlquist Collection for long-term preservation; (2) digitize and mobilize data for all collections materials held at both institutions; (3) link transcribed collection information, images, and metadata across all biological collections and archival objects; and (4) publish and make publicly available as an aggregated collection through online data portals, including iDigBio and GBIF. This project represents a unique collaborative and interdisciplinary opportunity between natural history collections and archives to create one of the first Extended Specimen Networks (ESN) for a renowned American botanist and serves more broadly to establish a new paradigm for how natural history collections and archives communities envision, implement, and utilize ESN’s within and among their collections. Integral to the project are the activities that involve participation from students at different levels in their academic career. The project will provide education, training, and capacity building for underserved youth and emerging professionals in a field that will greatly benefit from their participation. A workshop and symposium on ESN development are planned for the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections annual conference to provide training and resources to the collections community. Paired exhibits for the public and hosted at each institution will highlight the project.

"Animals such as cheetahs are often thought of as the exemplars of fast movement, when in fact small animals such as arthropods like trap-jaw ants, click beetles, and mantis shrimps can achieve accelerations six orders of magnitudes more than a cheetah. The overall goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant is to develop analytical and experimental tools to evaluate the dynamics of organisms capable of extreme accelerations and applying these principles towards designing a jumping micro-scale robot, using click beetles as a case study organism. Click beetles belong to a group of organisms that use latches and springs to amplify their muscle power output and circumvent the same actuation limitations that currently cripple micro-robots. The current state of the art in modeling such organisms lack the proper dynamic considerations that would allow engineers to implement the appropriate principles to engineered systems. The techniques developed in this project are beneficial to both biology and engineering. The modeling approach creates a framework to analyze a diverse group of organisms that use springs and latches to move extremely fast. These bioinspired principles enable a design framework for micro-robots to direct power towards the robot’s components for locomotion and dissipate energy elsewhere to prevent mechanical failure. The bioinspired nature of this research makes it an excellent candidate for outreach. Outreach activities include workshops and summer camps for first-generation undergraduates and low income and unrepresented high and middle school students to encourage them to pursue higher education, especially in STEM-related fields. 

This work will advance the fundamental knowledge of the dynamics of ultra-fast locomotion in biology and bio-inspired systems. Most of the literature studying these locomotion strategies in biological systems focus on observing the kinematics only or use overly simplified models for the dynamics. The modeling approach, namely mobility power flow provides insights into how an organism uses and augments muscle power output and how it transmits and dissipates this power for agile locomotion while mitigating damage. In the planned modeling approach, click beetles or micro-robots are represented as a global structure composed of substructures on elastic and rigid substrates to model various environments. Expressions for power transmission and dissipation through each substructure and at the junctions will be studied through mechanical mobility functions, which can be derived analytically or measured directly in experiments. The models and experimentation techniques will create a new pathway to study and design ultra-fast and small dynamic systems.

"Biological collections in the United States have amassed over 500 million specimens but only 14% of these have been digitized; thus we need to greatly expand existing tools and methods to efficiently digitize specimen data. This project addresses this need by transforming Symbiota, one of the most widely used software platforms for mobilizing specimens in US research collections. Symbiota is an online biodiversity data management software platform that integrates data and images from networks of data providers. It has helped mobilize over 37 million specimen records from 766 natural history collections and is one of the most successful platforms for creating large collaborative data communities for sharing and displaying biodiversity data. Symbiota is used by 74% of the projects funded by the NSF Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and is thus a key platform to help digitize the estimated 430 million specimens in US collections that have yet to be digitized. Symbiota's success is largely due to its low learning curve and powerful set of tools for documenting species occurrences and integrating them with images and detailed taxonomic descriptions. But its widespread use has yielded significant feedback on how it could be made more effective. To accomplish this and aid its future development, Symbiota needs a fundamental restructuring. This project will transform Symbiota into a new version, Symbiota2, to catalyze contributions, expand research use, enrich education-outreach activities, and increase sustainability. Symbiota2 will enhance our ability to address a broad spectrum of biodiversity-related research questions by facilitating data visualization, linking multiple data sources (e.g., publications), creating better tools for data quality assessment, and monitoring data usage.

The transformation of Symbiota into Symbiota2 will completely refactor its code structure to emphasize modularity and improve usability and accessibility. This transformation will achieve the following goals, derived through direct management of Symbiota data portals and concerted and dedicated interactions with the Symbiota user community: 1) Provide RESTful web services so that data can be easily incorporated into a scientific workflow, 2) Build a plugin architecture to ease the development of new features, 3) Create a database abstraction layer to include a wide variety of backend database management systems, 4) Increase data utility by supporting analytical and visualization tools, 5) Separate the Graphical User Interface (GUI) from other processing so that new GUIs can be used, and 6) Enhance the data collection by making it easier to add new kinds of data and work offline. With these goals met, Symbiota2 will be a powerful biodiversity data management system fulfilling the needs of developers, data providers, researchers, and education professionals, as well as being interoperable with other biodiversity initiatives.

"Biological collections play an essential role in life science research. They support fundamental scientific studies at the molecular, cellular, organismal and community level, as well as applied research to improve health, food security, and energy production. The United States Culture Collection Network (USCCN) was established in 2012, engaging the culture collection community to facilitate the safe and responsible utilization of microbial resources through meetings and webinars, publications and position papers, and site visits to learn about collection practices. This award will establish the USCCN 2.0, a new Research Coordination Network (RCN) that will expand the scope and reach of the USCCN. The USCCN 2.0 will increase the reach of scientists across multiple disciplines to work toward addressing challenges and needs shared by all microbial collection managers and users. USCCN 2.0 will expand the network and identify additional collections through an online registry accessible by the broader scientific community. These data will increase the breadth and utility of living plant microbial collections for multi-disciplinary scientific projects. USCCN 2.0 will encourage participation of underrepresented communities and will promote a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce, increase partnerships between industry, academia, and other entities, and enhance infrastructure for research and education.

The specific aims of USCCN 2.0 are to increase participation in the network; enhance links with other collection registries and repositories; and to cultivate the long-term sustainability of participating collections and the USCCN.  The work on each of these aims will be underpinned by complementing and synergizing activities with other projects, networks, organizations, and societies globally. A top priority of the RCN is a collection registry to provide the necessary foundation to accomplish the network’s activities, and to ensure inclusivity of small research collections.  Through a professionally administered process, a more extensive and diverse community of U.S. collections will be identified and brought into the network.  Additional priorities include increasing participation and coordination among U.S. and international biological collections organizations; establishing linkages between current and future collection registries, repositories, and other forms of collected data; and building direct ties to stakeholders – those who develop or utilize microbes, microbial collections, and other microbial resources for research or industrial purposes – to build a network of networks.

"Bipedalism is the ability to habitually stand and walk upright on two legs and is one of the defining features of humans. Consequently, our understanding of human evolution depends on reconstructing how and why bipedalism evolved. This doctoral dissertation research project uses information about the “family tree” of extinct human species to reconstruct how, when, and why skeletal features that are critical for bipedalism evolved. This reconstruction allows the project investigators to test key hypotheses about human origins, including those concerning the role that environmental factors may have played in shaping our evolutionary history. This study investigates how ecological conditions have influenced human evolution, a line of inquiry that is particularly important in the context of global climate change. This project also supports the research of an early career female scientist from an historically underrepresented group in STEM and contributes to the diversity of scholarship in Biological Anthropology.

This research tests two hypotheses relating patterns of character evolution to the ecological, temporal, and geographical contexts in which skeletal traits related to hominin bipedalism evolved. The first hypothesis addresses the patterns and processes by which bipedalism originated and subsequently evolved, as well as the selective history that may have shaped its evolution. The second hypothesis concerns whether the evolution of derived locomotor traits is temporally correlated with paleoenvironmental change and whether incorporating available paleoenvironmental data improves evolutionary models. Patterns of character evolution are analyzed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. Random and non-random evolutionary models are tested to examine which model is the most appropriate for explaining the evolution of hominin locomotor anatomy. The project helps answer several fundamental questions in paleoanthropology: How does phylogeny inform our understanding of the evolution of postcranial traits that function mechanically during bipedalism? What does the pattern of evolution for these traits tell us about how, why, and when bipedalism evolved during human evolution? What are the evolutionary forces driving the evolution of these characters? What are the magnitude and direction of changes in morphological characters that enhance bipedalism? How might changes in bipedal features relate to changes in the environment? Answers to these questions substantially inform our understanding of the evolution of one of the first and most fundamental hominin adaptations.

"Can computing systems be built out of living neurons? Can they achieve basic hallmarks of cognition such as learning, attention, curiosity, or creativity, so pervasive in biology yet elusive in modern computing? This Expedition imagines computers and robots that are human designed but living. That can be programmed, but whose behaviors are not specified, and instead, emerge. These systems will grow, heal, learn and explore. They will open a new space of possibilities yet to be imagined.

By shifting from digital, rigid architectures to plastic cellular substrates, speed, accuracy, and exactness are traded off for statistical robustness, extreme parallelism, healing, growth, and superior energy efficiency. Rather than Boolean logic, these post-von Neumann systems will harness the compositional dynamics of billions of neural elements to generate 'out-of-the-box', emergent forms of computations. They will interface with muscles and sensors, to give rise to organic machines able to probe their environment and explore it. This technology will have profound, lasting impact in virtually every field related to information processing, robotics, health and medicine, with deep ramification across human knowledge. Modern deep-networks implemented on power-hungry supercomputers may be dwarfed by bio-computing systems the size of an apple and running on sugar. Neuroscience could be revolutionized, with radically new behavioral models. Ethics research will be catalyzed. The legacy will be the inception of an in-vitro third form of ‘intelligence’, separate from AI and animal.

Building on recent advances in the engineering of multi-cellular constructs, insights into their dynamics via statistical physics, and guidance from information theory, this Expedition will develop the science and technology to fabricate, model, program, scale and embody biological processors. Research will unfold across four thrusts, structured around what makes a system compute and act: (1) Wetware – integrate neural cultures on engineered platforms; (2) Architecture – create a programmable substrate to support useful computations; (3) Programming – develop a software stack and a programming model to configure and run the substrate; (4) Robotic embodiment – demonstrate multi-sensory processing and probe the emergence of rudimentary cognitive traits in motile biological robots. A robust in-design ethics program will be pervasive of all aspects of research. The evocative power of this Expedition will excite students from all backgrounds and at all levels about computing. This will be leveraged to grow a Mind in Vitro community, through internships, workshops, seminars, and a dedicated mini-curriculum. Art-of-Science exhibitions in massive public spaces will allow us to connect with a broad and diverse audience. Finally, full commitment to open science is core, and protocols, software, hardware, and educational material will all be made freely available.

"Enzymes are specialized proteins that catalyze chemical reactions in biological systems. Changes in temperature, pressure, or composition of the environment surrounding the protein, among many other factors, can have significant effects on enzyme catalyzed reactions. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. G. Andres Cisneros from the University of North Texas and Dr. Pengyu Ren from the University of Texas at Austin to develop computational methods and software to accurately predict the effects that charges in the surrounding solvent have on enzymatic catalysis. Detailed understandings for how enzymes function in highly charged solvents (ionic liquids) potentially lead to the development of new bio-inspired catalysts for biotechnology and bioengineering applications. The state-of-the-art computational methods from this project are used to investigate the reaction mechanisms of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in different charged solutions. Peroxidases are important enzymes that help prevent oxidative damage in aerobic organisms. The newly developed methods and source codes for programs are made freely available, which impact the ability of the scientific community to predict the behavior of enzymes in a variety of environments. In addition, the project engages school students and teachers from underrepresented minority groups in the sciences through various outreach and mentoring programs at the two participating institutions.

The main premise of this project is that differences in temperatures at which homologous enzymes show maximum activity arise from differences in the balance between enthalpic and entropic contributions to the free energies of activation, even when these free energies are similar. This difference in enthalpic-entropic balance is due to differences in flexibility of surface residues. Alternatively, effects on the flexibility of surface residues from interactions with the solvent may exert long range-electrostatic effects on the active sites. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to apply quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations to investigate the effect of highly charged ionic liquid (IL) solutions on the enthalpic-entropic balance for enzymatic catalysis. This project continues the development of the AMOEBA-IL (atomic multipole optimized energetics for biomolecular applications in ionic liquids) force field and implements enhanced sampling methods in the QM/MM code of the LICHEM (Layered Interacting Chemical Models) package and its interface to TINKER-OpenMM molecular mechanics/dynamics sortware package. These tools are used to computationally model the reaction mechanism of horseradish peroxidase in different IL solutions. Arrhenius plots calculated for the various IL solution systems determine the enthalpic-entropic balance for each tested system to ascertain the effect of the different solvent environments on the reaction pathway. Results from this work provide fundamental insights into the role of solvents on enzyme catalysis and the role/impact of surface-residue flexibility on enzymatic reaction mechanisms. Additionally, this project develops new methods and parameters for AMOEBA, and these are made available to the broad scientific community.

"Estimating the age of individuals based on skeletal elements can inform our understanding of human biocultural experiences, identities, and population dynamics across the history of our species. Methods that use information about dental development are particularly useful for juvenile age estimation. This doctoral dissertation research project examines the developmental relationships between teeth and how these relationships affect error rates in juvenile dental age estimation. A better understanding of human variation in dental correlations can improve both methods of age estimation for bioarchaeological and forensic research as well as clinical understanding of human growth and development. The project supports graduate training in STEM, the development of open-source dental age estimation software, and online training workshops for researchers and practitioners.  

In order to simplify mathematical modeling, it is often assumed that dental developmental traits are independent from one another after accounting for the effect of chronological age. The problem with this conditional independence assumption is that if conditional independence is not biologically valid, resulting age estimates will be biased and have error rates that are larger than expected. This is a problem in both bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology because biased age estimates can compromise our understanding of past populations and unknown age interval error rates do not meet the Daubert standard for expert testimony. These issues are addressed through three specific aims: 1) characterize the extent of correlations between developing teeth, 2) characterize the degree of variability of correlations between developing teeth, and 3) develop, validate, and test an open-source developmental age estimation program that incorporates the correlations between teeth. These aims are approached using Bayesian statistical models and cluster analysis in R.

"In social species, there is variation in the extent to which individuals within groups use the position or behaviors of those closest to them to inform their own behavior; this is called social responsiveness. While previous research has demonstrated that variation in social responsiveness among individuals in a group influences ways in which the whole group behaves, this research has been through work in laboratories or using computer simulations. In order to better understand this phenomenon and how it relates to the evolution of social behavior, this doctoral dissertation research project examines these relationships in natural settings. The investigators use new tracking technologies and advance the field of biological anthropology by introducing non-invasive, image-based techniques for tracking nonhuman primate movements and interactions in the wild. Through this project the investigators create opportunities for both masters’ and undergraduate thesis projects and develop new educational modules on collective animal behavior targeted toward middle-school students. 

Collective behavior researchers have proposed that socially responsive individuals follow cues given by neighbors to make inferences about environmental conditions and resource locations, while unresponsive individuals gather information privately through independent investigation of the environment. Theory predicts that the extent of within-group variation in social responsiveness produces group-level traits, such as cohesion and collective decision-making regimes, which in turn have consequences for individual fitness. This project has three specific objectives: (1) identify the contexts in which wild female savannah baboons are socially responsive; (2) examine if variation in social responsiveness affects collective behavior; and (3) test if group composition affects individual fitness according to its expected effects on collective movement. To achieve these objectives, novel data are collected in the field using 3D stereo videography and GPS-accelerometer collars. Long-term demographic and behavioral data collected over five decades of population monitoring are used to contextualize results.  Furthermore, by considering the simultaneous “bottom-up” effects of individual variation on collective behavior and the “top-down” effects of collective behavior on individual fitness in a highly social primate, this project offers novel insight into the adaptive value of social responsiveness and its role in patterning group-level phenomena.

This project focuses on renewable biocatalysts for the efficient degradation of persistent organic contaminants in water. Surface-display enzyme biocatalysts are a new class of biocatalysts that have recently been shown to have high catalytic efficiency and high stability. With surface display technology, functional enzymes are expressed and displayed on the outer surface of microbial host cells by fusion with a cell wall using molecular biology techniques.  Research efforts will be integrated with an education plan that impacts education at multiple levels, ranging from middle school to graduate school. The success of the proposed research will enable development of more effective tools to implement biocatalysis using synthetic biology for addressing pressing challenges of water sustainability.  In future work use of other target enzymes in the cell surface-display system will be used to create new biocatalysts to address challenges relevant to other components at the food-water-energy nexus.

The overall research goal of this project is to develop a new class of engineered biocatalysts with surface display technology for the effective degradation of persistent organic contaminants. Initially, fungal enzymes will be used in the investigation of cell surface-display systems to harness enzyme activities with a focus on degradation of endocrine disrupting compounds. Renewability is assured by the ability to generate and automatically localize the target enzyme on the surface of cells through engineered biological machinery, making production and regeneration of the biocatalyst efficient and scalable.  The research plan will address fundamental aspects: i) molecular design of surface display machinery for high catalytic efficiency, ii) a strategy for improving robustness under conditions relevant to advanced wastewater treatment, iii) creation of multi-enzyme surface displays for efficient cascade reactions. Renewable biocatalysts with different functions will be created and applied to biotransformations beyond contaminant degradation. Research efforts will be integrated with an education plan that aims to i) increase the motivation and participation of female and other underrepresented students in pursuing careers in environmental engineering and science, ii) educate the next generation of engineers regarding synthetic biology for environmental sustainability, and iii) enhance interdisciplinary thinking and communication skills in graduate training. These goals will be addressed in synergy with the research by leading undergraduates in both research and outreach, 6-12 grade outreach, new course development, and organization of an interdisciplinary graduate symposium.","Urbana","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","47.041","500000","EnvE-Environmental Engineering","2154345","nawei2@illinois.edu","Na","Wei","03/10/2022","10/01/2021","04/30/2023","CAREER: SusChEM: Renewable Biocatalysts for Degradation of Persistent Organic Contaminants Using Synthetic Biology","BIO"
"The Atlanta Botanical Garden (ABG) has served as a leader in plant science research, education, and conservation for more than four decades. These collections house 106,028 individual plants from 25,335 genetically unique accessions representing 12,096 taxa (species, subspecies, and varieties) from 276 plant families and over 1,800 genera. Most notably, ABG maintains the most diverse living collection of orchids in the United States with 2,328 taxa. Data related to these diverse plant collections are currently stored in an in-house database and are not accessible by the public or researchers. The focus of this project is to upgrade data storage to a modern commercial database with a public interface allowing visitors, researchers, conservationists, and educators to search ABG plant collections remotely or while at the Garden. This project will make plant collections at the Atlanta Botanical Garden publicly accessible for research, education, and conservation.

Botanic gardens play a critical role in basic plant research by providing freshly collected plant material to researchers from extensive living plant collections for very low cost. In addition, a highly skilled staff of horticulturists maintain and preserve collections full-time. The Plant Collections at the Atlanta Botanical Garden have been used in NSF funded projects and many other research projects, including graduate student research, and for conservation projects. To increase visibility and use of the collections for research, this project will migrate the existing Plant Records database to an updated platform which will be connected to external databases, making collection data publicly searchable. Priority plant collections will be digitized and permanently planted priority collections will be mapped. Research requests will be streamlined via creation of a Google Form. This will enable collection information to be shared with the greater research community via outreach to professional botanical societies and on the Garden’s social media pages. We expect utilization of the collection to significantly increase, allowing creative and impactful research to be undertaken with plants in the collections. During public events showcasing the collections the public database interface will be promoted to encourage visitors to explore collections digitally both before, during, and after their visit to the Garden. Finally, undergraduate and high school students will be integrated into the digitization project, learning plant morphology and GIS mapping, which are useful and transferable skills.

"The broader impact of this Partnerships for Innovation (Mid-Career Advancement) (PFI (MCA)) proposal is to simultaneously improve air quality and infrastructure durability. The research is motivated by recent insights on emissions of volatile organic compounds and ozone precursors during the lifetime of asphalt-surfaced areas (e.g., roads, roofs bridge decks, etc.). This project will engineer functionalized carbon from biowaste to remove ozone precursors emitted from pavements. The functionalized carbon will be made via thermochemical conversion of a combined feedstock of food waste and algal biomass. Computational simulations, machine learning, optimization, and laboratory experiments will be combined to determine the underlying mechanisms controlling adsorption of known gases into functionalized carbon. This functionalized carbon will be introduced to bituminous composites to increase the retention of compounds that would otherwise be released to the surrounding atmosphere. The study presents a new vision where outdoor construction elements can positively contribute to environmental health. The proposed intervention is designed to simultaneously enhance the durability of outdoor construction elements and the quality of surrounding air by retaining compounds that otherwise leave bitumen and enter the air, with some serving as ozone precursors, negatively impacting air quality and human health outcomes. The project involving minority graduate students in education, outreach activities, and cutting-edge interdisciplinary research. 

This proposal seeks to promote the use of two waste streams (algal biofuels and food waste) to address ozone concerns while contributing to carbon sequestration and extending the service life of outdoor construction undergoing intense ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. This project will integrate computational modeling and data analytics for the design and synthesis of functionalized carbon with desirable retention characteristics for select bitumen compounds. It has been documented that aging is accompanied by the loss of alkane and aromatic compounds in bitumen, so retention of the latter compounds via functionalized carbon is expected to not only improve air quality but also delay the aging of bituminous composites, especially those used in outdoor construction that are subjected to various degrees of UV exposure, depending on their location. This proposal may result in significant resource conservation while promoting economic growth within a bio-mass value chain where waste from algal biofuel and food is converted into value-added products.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of airborne and surface disinfection using narrow band ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs). UV emitters have a wide range of applications in airborne and surface disinfection, bio-medical and analytical instrumentation, fluorescence sensing, curing, and phototherapy. The traditional sources of UV lamps contain either mercury, xenon, argon, deuterium, or an excimer. All are considered unsatisfactory as they are bulky, fragile, expensive, low efficiency, have a limited life span, toxic, and only capable of emitting at a few specific wavelengths. Another alternative is the UV LED, which combines compactness with a nontoxic material composition, a lower power consumption, a quick response time, a long lifetime, and tunable emission across the entire UV region. Additionally, the nanowire form factor is ideal for integrating the light-emitter within the filter fabric for enhancing antibacterial and particulate filtration in air/surface purification and disinfection systems. Broad benefits to society including the new technologies, socioeconomic and environmental impacts as well as commercial potential are expected for such nanowire emitters.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of high-performance narrow band UV LEDs for airborne and surface disinfection. The disinfection UV LED technology aims at inactivating the spreading of microorganisms living in indoor spaces otherwise people are at risk of infection. The current common disinfectants include chemical sprays and hand and body washing. These approaches fail to kill viruses, bacteria, fungi, and microbes in real time. The chemical substances usually contain contaminants and raise health concerns. Disinfection UVC LEDs, however, are a rapid tool for inactivation, and environmentally friendly. The narrow band UVC LEDs are produced using the following steps: 1) synthesizing nanowire UVC LED structures using molecular beam epitaxy; 2) integrating optical bandpass filters into the LEDs to attain narrow band LEDs; and 3) combining nanowire UVC LEDs with current white-light LEDs to form a smart disinfection lighting-system. Like visible color LEDs that have revolutionized lighting and display, UVC LEDs are set to provide disinfection solutions in both air and on surfaces.

"The goals of this project are to develop advanced imaging techniques and innovative microscopic probes to determine how biological cells respond to force and to train U.S. students in these techniques. These experiments will help us understand how stem cells differentiate into functional cell types, how cancer cells spread, and how blood flow is regulated. Understanding how cells interact with their environment is essential for developing treatments for a variety of health-related issues, ranging across joint repairs, cancer therapeutics, tissue engineering, and heart and vascular disease prevention and treatment. The scientific goals will be accomplished via a focused international collaboration that provides intensive research training for graduate and undergraduate students. Each year, research will be conducted by 4 - 6 U.S. students working toward their Ph.D. or undergraduate senior thesis under joint supervision of professors from Lehigh University and researchers in the French National Laboratories in the University of Bordeaux, France. Each of the participating students will work in Bordeaux laboratories in the summer and at Lehigh for the rest of the year. Gender balance and race and ethnic diversities will be considered to ensure the development of the United States STEM workforce in a diverse, inclusive and international environment.

A team of Lehigh faculty in science and engineering departments in collaboration with CNRS researchers in the University of Bordeaux, France will conduct themed research projects with aims to develop multiscale microrheology to investigate mechanotransduction of multicellular organoids, time-lapse confocal imaging of stem cell differentiation in 3D-printed scaffolds, and magnetic nanoparticle-mediated transport of membrane-bound proteins on a supported membrane. Three model systems are to be developed for such investigation: organelles confined by sub-millimeter hydrogel capsules, 3D printed bio-scaffolds and supported lipid membranes embedded with magnetic nanoparticle-labeled membrane-bound proteins. Multiscale imaging modalities, including fluorescence confocal microscopy and optical coherent tomography, will be used to examine cellular and extracellular milieu at different length scales. Multiscale rheology probes, including microbeads manipulated by optical tweezers, deformable microgels and oil or fat droplets, will be used to map the stress-strain field in subcellular to multicellular domains. Correlation between cellular growth and response and the stress-strain maps will guide the researchers in developing theoretical models as well as testing the validity of these models. This project will advance understanding of mechanotransduction of stem cell differentiation and cell migration in complex three dimensional environments. Experiments on transport of membrane proteins will generate new data and experimental approaches to discover the mechanisms that cells use to respond to blood flow. Success of this project will be assessed by journal publications and by presentations of research by the participating students in national and international conferences.

"The human skeleton is capable of plastic responses to biomechanical pressures, including those associated with chewing. This doctoral dissertation project examines relationships between dietary patterns and skeletal characteristics through analysis of pre-industrial populations with various weaning and subsistence practices. The research advances insights about biocultural factors that may influence skeletal growth and development in our species, including factors affecting dental alignment and function.  The project fosters graduate student training of a female scientist, dissemination of findings including to clinical audiences, science education and curriculum development for students, and public science communication through popular science outlets. 

While researchers have found differences in face and jaw shape with differing subsistence strategies, the effects of weaning practices and the biomechanical effects of suckling are not well understood. Additionally, modern infant behavior such as thumb-sucking, bottle-feeding and early termination of breastfeeding are implicated in the rise of dental malocclusions, suggesting that shifts in weaning practices that are thought to have occurred with the advent of farming may be partially responsible for the increase in modern dental occlusion problems. This project investigates associations between facial morphology, weaning practices, and subsistence strategies, using cranial and mandibular 3D scan data. The project also seeks to assess the association between weaning/subsistence behavior and dental occlusion patterns by quantifying dental occlusion using modern orthodontic criteria.

"The human species has been shaped by many biological and cultural processes, including the infectious diseases we have experienced over the millennia and our responses to those events. Given the ongoing threat of emerging infectious disease, understanding the ways in which humans and pathogens impacted one another in the past can inform infectious disease research in the present. This doctoral dissertation project examines the origins and evolution of the disease pathogen responsible for the deadliest form of human malaria (P. falciparum). This pathogen is thought to have evolved through the transfer of a gorilla parasite to humans, but the timing and anthropological context for this event and malaria’s subsequent global spread remain poorly understood. The project traces malaria’s evolutionary history through analysis of both ancient P. falciparum genomes and related great ape parasites. The project also generates new methods and tools that can be applied in other genomic research projects, fosters student training and international research collaborations, and generates new resources for public science education and outreach. 

The project is part of an international collaborative effort of geneticists and primatologists to reconstruct genomes from ancient Plasmodium falciparum and related great ape parasites. Using genomic analyses to estimate when P. falciparum first emerged as a human parasite, the co-PI and colleagues explore whether specific ecological and/or cultural factors, particularly the adoption or diversification of agriculture, may have favored this zoonotic event. Comparing ancient and modern parasite genomes, the investigators explore the timing and route of malaria’s global dissemination to understand the impact of human mobility on pathogen dispersal in the past. This project is anticipated to generate valuable, concrete resources for the broader scientific community, including genome-wide data from ancient Plasmodium falciparum and wild-living gorilla Plasmodium parasites.

"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). 

Esophageal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in the USA, with a poor survival rate. Late diagnosis is a primary reason for this since esophageal cancer does not present early symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop fast and effective targeted therapies for esophageal cancer, improving drug tolerance and clinical outcomes. Evidence from limited clinical studies has shown that cell signaling pathways present significantly altered genetic expressions in esophageal cancer cells and have been found to correlate with poor prognosis and disease progression. Moreover, compared with other solid tumor malignancies, esophageal cancer presents many more stochastic heterogeneities and diverse origins, which have been found to be major factors of drug resistance. Thus, due to the cost and time limitations of clinical trials, it is of paramount importance to develop computational frameworks that can accurately represent the stochastic behavior of signaling pathways and provide a rapid and cost-effective evaluation of combination therapies to control esophageal cancer. This project aims to elucidate the aforementioned questions by new mathematical modeling of the dynamical behavior of a class of signaling pathways in esophageal cancer and associated treatment strategies. The framework can also be adapted for the rapid evaluation of treatments in other cancer types and chronic diseases. The project will be conducted at the University of Texas at Arlington, a Hispanic-Serving institution. The project will bolster students from underrepresented groups in research and provide training opportunities through project-based learning modules and a new graduate course in computational mathematical biology. Finally, this project will lay the foundation for the investigator's long-term goal to develop a Center for Integrative Math-Bio and Experimental Research (CIMBEX). The center will promote integrative mathematical biology and experimental research environment for students from underrepresented groups and bolster student retention in STEM.
 
This project aims to define and validate a novel stochastic mathematical framework for analyzing and controlling the dynamical behavior of a key stochastic signaling pathway in esophageal cancer, known as epidermal growth factor receptor, for a better understanding of associated monitoring and treatment strategies. The specific research objectives are to (1) develop and analyze a controlled hybrid switching diffusion process, in a Fokker-Planck setting, that accounts for heterogeneity-induced stochasticity in the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway dynamics, and (2) build a new gradient-free optimal control algorithm, based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, that provides qualitatively accurate and computationally efficient numerical simulations of treatment outcomes using combination therapies, validated by esophageal cancer signaling data from laboratory experiments. The outcomes of this project will be the development of a new modeling and control framework for dynamical processes, the promotion of interdisciplinary research with biologists, and research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups. While the focus is on cancer mechanisms, the project aims to define a mathematical framework that applies equally well to other chronic diseases, where stochasticity plays an important role.

"This Division of Earth Science Instrumentation and Facilities Program award will continue operational support for the Institute for Rock Magnetism (IRM) at the University of Minnesota for the next five years. The IRM is a multi-user facility for pure and applied research on the magnetic properties of rocks, sediments, and minerals. IRMS provides instrumental infrastructure, technical expertise, and educational outreach for the Earth Science community and related disciplines for research in Earth, planetary and environmental sciences. The IRM serves as a national facility for research into the physics and chemistry of magnetization in natural materials resulting from geologic, biologic, and anthropogenic processes in the Earth system and covering time scales from the present and recent past to billions of years ago. Natural-material magnetic research is an essential part of larger scientific efforts to understand the origin and evolution of the geomagnetic field and the deep interior of Earth and terrestrial planets; the history of tectonic plates; and the evolution of Earth’s surficial environments and climate. The five-year project will continue to strengthen opportunities for community-based research and promote the progress of science by: (1) maintaining the integrity, function, and accuracy of the facility instrumentation and computer resources, which maintains the IRM database; (2) providing access and support to over 150 visiting scientists from the US and abroad projected to use IRM facilities during the award period; (3) training and education of undergraduate, graduate students, and early career scientists; and (4) providing research-related information to the Earth science community and related disciplines through biennial conferences, website, online database, and a quarterly newsletter. The well-established biennial rock magnetism summer school provides a ten-day workshop for hands-on, lab-based, training for graduate and early career scientists.

The magnetic behavior of particle assemblages of iron oxides, hydroxides, sulfides and iron alloys is governed by a combination of physical and chemical processes at the nanometric to micrometric levels which makes magnetic measurements sensitive indicators of mineral composition, crystallography, microstructures, and particle size, shape and orientation distributions. The magnetization that emerges from these processes and properties is affected by time, temperature, pressure, external magnetic fields, and (bio)geochemical surroundings. Understanding how these processes operate is the foundation for determining magnetic mineral compositions, concentrations and size distributions in natural samples, and for understanding the origin and significance of natural remanent records of ancient magnetic fields on Earth and other planetary bodies. A suite of advanced instruments enables sensitive measurements of magnetization under controlled conditions of temperature, magnetic fields, time, and orientation, and allow detailed characterization of magnetic mineralogy in geological, extraterrestrial, biological, and anthropogenic materials. Research facilitated by the analytical and technical capabilities of the IRM improves our understanding of how the complex natural recording systems work, and to maximize the information that we can recover from magnetic analysis of natural materials. Research activities are carried out by IRM scientists and students and visiting researchers, and encompass a range of aspects, from basic understanding of rock and mineral magnetism, to applied studies in which magnetic characteristics of rocks and sediments are used as tools for investigating a wide variety of geological and surficial Earth processes. The scale of investigations extends from bacterial magnetic particles and environmental reconstructions to plate tectonic reconstructions and magnetic mapping of other planets.

"This project is concerned with the development of an analytic and geometric theory of random fields that arise from stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and random matrices. Special emphasis is placed on vector-valued and matrix-valued random fields that play a central role in various areas of pure and applied mathematics, mathematical physics, astronomy, bio-imaging, mathematical oceanography, and statistics. The Principal Inestigator (PI) will develop probabilistic, analytic, and geometric tools for studying vector-valued and matrix-valued random fields that will lead to a deeper understanding of random fields that arise from systems of SPDEs and random matrices. These tools will have sufficient novelty to open new research areas, solve a number of open problems in the theory of SPDEs, random matrices, and related random fields. Moreover, the proposed activities will also help to train graduate students and to develop their careers in the mathematical and statistical sciences. 

It is significant and challenging to characterize the fine analytic and geometric structures of vector-valued and matrix-valued random fields. In the past investigations, the PI has established a series of results on Gaussian and, more generally, infinitely divisible random fields, and the solutions of SPDEs. Together with his collaborators, the PI has developed fractal geometry and potential theory for Gaussian random fields, additive Lévy processes, solutions to SPDEs, and used them to resolve several outstanding open problems in non-Markovian Gaussian and stable random fields, Lévy processes, and the theory of SPDEs. The PI plans to continue his investigation of precise quantitative connections between vector-valued and matrix-valued random fields, SPDEs, potential theory, and the geometry of random fractals. The proposed research will ultimately yield novel insights into the understanding of vector-valued and matrix-valued random fields, SPDEs, and random matrices. The expected results will not only contribute to the theories of random fields, SPDEs, and random matrices but also promote their applicability in mathematics, mathematical physics, and in other scientific areas.

"When human groups first come into contact, diseases can be transmitted rapidly through previously unexposed populations. In the past, diseases during initial contact are believed to have led to mass mortality and likely influenced the outcome of colonization attempts. This doctoral dissertation project uses ancient DNA data to detect pathogens associated with conquest and colonization and determine how the pathogens evolved and why they were so deadly. The project outcomes can advance knowledge about the consequences of colonization as well as the evolution and ecology of diseases, many of which are still a struggle to treat and control today. The researchers emphasize substantive collaborations with descendant communities and community stakeholders. Local communities are actively involved in the project, and the research contributes to educational materials and museum exhibits in those regions. The project also fosters science communication and public outreach activities and provides laboratory training for undergraduates, including students from underrepresented groups in STEM.

This ancient pathogen genomics project aims to identify which specific pathogens were causing the widespread deaths of Indigenous people during European conquest, how these diseases evolved in a new environment, and how different environments and/or cultural practices may have led to differences in disease spread or mortality outcomes. The study examines data generated from approximately 200 individuals from four strategically selected early contact-era sites of differing ecological and cultural environments. The researchers use gold-standard ancient pathogen genomics methods to sequence the DNA of these pathogens, determine their evolutionary trees, confirm their European origin, discover how and when they may have evolved into modern-day strains, and detect hybridization or diversification events. Where there is enough data, the researchers also perform functional analyses to identify variants through specific defining markers such as any gene loss or gain important for virulence or pathogenicity. In addition to standard high-throughput genomics and bioinformatics methods, this study incorporates historical accounts, disease ecology, and archaeological contexts to uncover a more comprehensive perspective of key events in human history.

"With support from both the Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Division of Materials Research, an award is made to the University of Delaware to design and develop plans for a national network of ultrahigh field (UHF) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer facilities. The overall goal of the project will be to create the most powerful NMR network in the world with comprehensive resources and expertise, spanning key areas of NSF interest, that will be accessible to the entire scientific community within the United States. Gains in sensitivity, resolution, and information content are highly nonlinear with magnetic field strength, and ultrahigh fields combined with state-of-the-art NMR probes and pulse sequences will enable fundamental investigations, with atomic resolution, of emergent phenomena not accessible with the current technologies.  State-of-the-art UHF NMR instruments will be sited at strategically located public institutions geographically distributed across the US. The NMR network will be made available to researchers across multiple disciplines for advancing the development and use of in vivo, in vitro, in situ, solution, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy to address diverse problems of high fundamental and technological importance. Instruments will be connected through a central cyberinfrastructure hub and integrated with other high-field and UHF NMR instrumentation.  The proposed nationwide UHF NMR network will enable experts and non-experts to access both UHF NMR instruments and a diversity of NMR expertise. The intellectual framework established through the proposed network will provide unique training for students in state- of-the-art NMR methods and applications. The outreach program encompassing training in NMR instrumentation and application of NMR methods will be invaluable for the development of the next generation of scientists.

Planning the UHF NMR network will set the stage to address the urgent nationwide need for ultrahigh field NMR infrastructure. The planning activities supported by this award will identify the primary scientific, technical and system performance requirements and associated designs and specifications for the UHF NMR network. Through these activities, the researchers will formulate a plan to execute and manage the UHF NMR network, including a project schedule with identified risks and plans to mitigate them, a governance plan and effective project management methods for tracking progress, costs and performance.  Outcomes from this effort will include sound baseline cost estimates for implementation and anticipated operations and maintenance costs. The researchers will also develop plans for effective student training and the involvement of a diverse workforce in instrumentation, facility development, and data analysis.

"With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry, Davita L. Watkins of the University of Mississippi is developing polymeric systems that can encapsulate biocompatible organic fluorophores for fluorescence imaging.  Fluorophores are dyes that contain special carbon-carbon double bonds called pi-bonds.  When these pi-bonds are irradiated with light of a certain wavelength, it enables the fluorophores to re-emit that light but with a different wavelength and much higher intensity.  This unique characteristic makes them particularly useful for bioimaging applications.  In this research, biocompatible amphiphilic polymers containing both water-loving (hydrophilic) and oil-loving (lipophilic) segments will first be prepared.  Their amphiphilic properties resemble those of other artificial compounds such as soaps and detergents, or even naturally occurring lipoproteins.  Synthesized polymers will then be assembled to create well-defined nanosized capsules which are capable to trap fluorophores.  Various dynamic processes that will occur during polymer assembly and encapsulation will be studied using several spectroscopic techniques.  Results associated with this research have the potential to advance the field of bioimaging and further understanding of optical properties of fluorophores in nanoconfined environments.  This work is a multi-disciplinary study in which fundamental aspects of development will provide fertile ground for the training of early career scientists and offer design guidelines toward functional polymeric materials.  Specific outreach endeavors will focus on research activities for transfer students and/or students having nontraditional academic paths as they make up a significant portion of the collegiate population in the state of Mississippi.  The research will equip the next generation of scientists with the skills, collaborative spirit, and creativity to solve complex societal problems.  A diverse scholastic population will also become more exposed to the emerging and dynamic area of fluorescence imaging, preparing them to contribute to an expanding STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce.  

This research will develop new approaches to biocompatible organic fluorophores for fluorescence imaging.  Specific emphasis will be placed on developing linear-dendritic block copolymers and dye-polymer conjugates with optical properties in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000–1400 nm), which has emerged as a high-priority in recent years due to poor stability and biocompatibility of current agents.  By employing amphiphilic substrates, the fundamental mechanism of self-assembly that results in well-defined, uniform nanostructures ideal for fluorescence imaging will be elucidated.  From the point of view of macromolecular design, linear-dendritic block copolymers will be synthesized with hydrophobic blocks consisting of polyesters such as polylactides and polycaprolactones.  Hydrophilic dendritic branches will be composed of polyamidoamines. NIR-II fluorescent dyes with aggregation-induced emissive molecular frameworks capable of self-assembling into monodisperse micellar structures will be strategically designed with thienothiadiazole and thienoselenadiazole units as the core acceptor structures.  This research is cross-cutting with relevance to principles of organic and physical chemistry, and materials science. The work has the potential to contribute to bio-imaging development by providing a deeper understanding of unconventional related photophysical phenomena.

"""Smart"" systems pervade society. Computers appear to be on every desk, in every backpack, and in everyone’s pocket. Smart appliances, smart watches and smart autonomous cars are no longer distant research goals; they entwine with the fabric of everyday life. Yet, compared with biology, humans' ability for manipulation of structure and dynamics at the nanoscale is found wanting. Imagine a world where one can program ""smart"" molecules – as is done today with software – to not only store and process information, but to also manipulate matter with nanometer precision, to sense (bio-)chemical signals from their environment, to perform robust and complex computation, and to actuate a physical response in situ. Such mastery over the physical world using molecular computers will have as profound a change on society as contemporary computers have had on the ability to store and process information electronically. This research proposes new techniques, new design principles and new architectures to program the molecular world with robust, ""field-programmable"" DNA circuits. These circuits will be reconfigurable by non-experts and without sophisticated laboratory equipment, they will be capable of exquisite detection, and they will be embeddable within paper to enable future applications that include scientific outreach and point-of-care diagnostics that can be easily distributed in low-resource settings. Integrated with the technical goals of this project is the development of summer research experiences for upper level K-12 students, and an undergraduate class in molecular computation that will broaden participation in computing by reaching across subject boundaries.

The project will develop new DNA strand displacement (DSD) architectures that maintain the robustness property of recent ""leakless"" systems and prioritize ease of preparation via biological production, ease of use by non-experts, and ease of reconfiguration by implementing programmable logic arrays. Robust and composable DSD modules will be developed for exponential signal amplification in vitro and in paper-based devices. These new architectures are grounded in theory and tempered by practical experimental concerns. New algorithms and software for molecular design and automation will be implemented to meet these goals.

"Arsenic causes severe toxicological effects in humans, yet some human populations have evolved to tolerate this element. Today, people in some regions may carry protective mutations in a key enzyme that metabolizes arsenic in the liver. However, several aspects remain unclear about the evolutionary history and genetic basis of arsenic tolerance. This doctoral dissertation research project therefore examines the genetic history, modes of subsistence, and gene regulatory mechanisms in ancient and modern DNA samples from populations exposed to arsenic. The findings can expand our understanding of biocultural processes through which humans are able to adapt to their environment. The project also supports student mentorship and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, opportunities for international research collaborations, and science dissemination through conferences and social media.

This project is centered on the understanding of the cultural and biological diversity of ancient and modern populations living in an arsenic rich region. Specifically, three main questions are addressed: (1) what are the genetic history and relationships among ancient and modern populations? (2) how did the transition to agriculture impact diet and oral health? and (3) what role/function do the mutations associated with arsenic tolerance play in the expression of the AS3MT gene? The researcher reconstructs the genetic prehistory of the region using ancient DNA and modern genomic data. In addition, oral microbiome data from ancient dental calculus are used to characterize the prehistoric diet, oral health and environmental exposures among pre-agricultural and agricultural populations. Third, genetic sequences carrying protective mutations are used to assess experimentally whether they alter/regulate the expression of the AS3MT gene in vitro.

"Biological collections are a primary source of information to understand Earth’s biodiversity. They not only document existing diversity, but also provide the baseline to track changes across time and geography, as well as extinctions at local and global scales. This project aims to rescue the orphaned Fish Collection of the Department of Marine Sciences at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez (UPR-M), improve access to specimens and associated information, and expand the shelving capacity of the Ichthyology Collection at the Sam Noble Museum (SNOMNH). Integration and accessibility of the two fish collections have the potential to be used across multiple scientific disciplines, including ecology, conservation biology, taxonomy, phylogenetics, fisheries management, anatomy, and physiology. The proposed activities for this proposal are organized around three primary goals—rescue, integration, and long-term preservation—each associated with specific timelines to achieve the overarching proposal goals. The team combines expertise of graduate and undergraduate students, and volunteers with museum experience at different levels in Oklahoma and Puerto Rico to provide a rich context for workshops, and for the development of an integrative training program for the next generation of scientists.
	Natural history collections play a fundamental role as repositories of biodiversity and provide verifiable and permanent records of wildlife and past environmental conditions. This project will rescue and safeguard the UPR-M Ichthyology Collection, one the largest biorepositories of marine fish biodiversity in the Caribbean, encompassing historical data from 13,000 specimens, comprising 805 species, 392 genera, and 123 families in imminent danger to become lost. Integration of the UPR-M Ichthyology collection into the SNOMNH will greatly increase its accessibility to scientists and other users through improved physical access, specimen loans, digitization of the collection, and sharing of data via the museum website, and other network portals. This project will enhance the infrastructure of the SNOMNH Ichthyology Collection and increase its scientific value and accessibility for scientists, educators, and the general public. The SNOMNH Ichthyology Collection is an important scientific resource and biological legacy for the lower Great Plains representing about 20% of the total fish diversity of the United States. It hosts diverse assemblages of mostly freshwater fishes (although its scope has recently expanded to include marine fish species as well), and endemic regional fish fauna from streams and reservoirs in Oklahoma. This project will provide multiple opportunities for integrating research into learning and education activities. Students at UPR-M and OU will participate in the collections-based activities as part of their academic and practical experiences and summer workshops at Puerto Rico.

"Early social adversity can shape an individual’s brain and behavior across the lifespan, but how these negative experiences exert their influence remains poorly understood. This doctoral dissertation project investigates the relationship between early life environment and aspects of microscopic brain anatomy in two nonhuman primate species. The research leverages existing primate brain collections to advance knowledge about early life stressors, brain, and behavior, and provides broader comparative context for research on similar processes in humans. The project supports graduate research and training in STEM and provides laboratory training and mentoring opportunities to undergraduate students who will have an active role in the research. The investigators plan to share these results with broad audiences via publications, conference talks, and science engagement activities with the public.

In early life, young individuals of many species rely on their mothers or caregivers to provide emotional support and to teach them the skills needed to thrive. Past research has indicated that adult animals who experienced separation from their mothers or caregivers at a young age exhibit anatomical differences in their brains such as significant increases in the size of some brain areas and tracts that connect these structures. Notably, the parts of the brain that are most affected make up the reward circuit, which functions to promote learning and motivate behaviors. Consequently, these anatomical differences in the brain could contribute to the development of social and cognitive deficits associated with early social adversity. The main objective of this project is to investigate at the microscopic level how rearing environment in early life can result in long-term structural changes of the reward circuit. The investigators use existing primate brain collections to compare individuals with different rearing histories across two species that are thought to vary in terms of neural plasticity. In each of these brains, the investigators perform analyses to visualize and quantify 1. connections made between neurons, 2. morphology of neurons, and 3. receptor expression of neurons. With these data, the investigators can begin to describe the mechanisms behind changes in brain structure as a result of early social adversity.

"Extreme weather events are hazardous to human health in many ways.  Some health risks, such as heat stroke, result directly from human exposure to exreme conditions.  Others, such as cholera outbreaks, occur indirectly as extreme weather overwhelms infrastructure for clean water, sanitation, and other necessities of human health.  Such health risks are expected to worsen due to climate change, as warmer temperatures lead to increased incidence of heat waves, droughts, fires, and floods.  They are also of greatest concern in regions of social vulnerability, including much of Africa.

This award provides support for a conference which brings together researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to consider the health impacts of climate extremes in Africa and develop strategies to respond to them.  The conference is motivated in part by recent advances in the prediction of African weather and climate extremes which have not yet been incorporated into health early warning systems and other public health efforts.  Interactions across multiple research disciplines and between researchers and stakeholders will be required to fully realize the heath benefits of better climate information.  This conference serves as a starting point for such interactions.

The meeting is organized as a Chapman Conference of the American Geophysical Union (AGU), to be held June 7-10 at the AGU headquarters building in Washington DC.  Deliverables of the meeting, in addition to its role as a venue to foster interactions, include conference proceedings published as an AGU monograph or special issue, a meeting report intended for a non-technical audience, and a while paper with recommendations for the use of climate information to improve health outcomes in Africa.  Funds provided by the National Science Foundation support the travel of students, early-career scientists, and invited speakers to attend the meeting.  Support for the meeting comes from the Geosciences (GEO), Biological Sciences (BIO), and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE) Directorates, and complements support provided by other federal agencies and non-governmental sources.

"Human leadership is thought to be unique compared to other animals in that it is often rooted in prestige rather than dominance. That is, instead of coercing others using physical intimidation, prestigious human leaders attract followers through admiration. Our closest living relatives provide crucial comparisons for understanding how the transition to prestige-based leadership happened in human evolutionary history. In some species, individuals maintain hierarchies that are defined by aggression but also show relatively extensive cooperation, which has been proposed to underlie human prestige. This doctoral dissertation research project investigates whether wild nonhuman primates exhibit some features of prestige-based leadership while at the same time keeping the dominance-based leadership seen in other animals. As part of this project, the investigators offer a leadership workshop for primary schools that emphasizes the value of cooperative leadership and opportunities for girls’ leadership while supporting scientific engagement and student-centered STEM learning.

The investigators integrate an intensive field study with long-term hormonal and behavioral data from the community of wild nonhuman primates to be studied to conduct a comprehensive non-invasive exploration of leadership in these primates. To do so, they develop a novel statistical method to assess whether longitudinal stability of stress physiology is indicative of individual variation in temperament. Next, they examine whether consistently moderate stress responses and non-reactive temperaments that distinguish prestigious human leaders also predict tolerant, prosocial behavioral strategies in nonhuman primates. Finally, they probe how behavioral strategies contribute to leadership pathways rooted in dominance versus prestige, specifically asking whether prosociality incurs benefits via social attractiveness independently of conventional dominance rank.

"Human populations have migrated to nearly every environment in the world, and as part of this process have modified and integrated with local ecologies. Human alterations to the environment, such as deforestation, contribute significantly to zoonotic disease transmission, including transmission of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms) from animals to humans, and from humans to animals. Less well studied are the impacts of the human-altered environment on marine mammal populations. This doctoral dissertation research project investigates the transmission of a human pathogen into marine mammal populations, uses preserved microorganisms on historical marine mammal remains as a unique resource to measure human-animal pathogen transmission, and explores the impact of human alterations on the marine environment. This project and the dissemination of its results serve to build collaborative research among anthropologists, conservation biologists and environmental ecologists through publication and through outreach with the National Parks Service, Skype a Scientist, and STEM mentorship for the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. 

Coastal runoff increases the introduction of human pathogens and antibiotics into the environment. This can lead to the spread of zoonotic disease in wildlife and the environmental selection for antibiotic resistance. Of importance, Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common hospital acquired infection of humans, has become endemic among California sea lions along the California Channel Islands. In addition, a hypervirulent strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp), has been documented along the Pacific Rim. However, the origin of this transmission event is unknown. This project studies the introduction of Klebsiella pneumoniae into the California sea lion population using museum collections. Museum collections can provide a timeline for studying environmental alterations as well as pathogen emergence. The investigators use metagenomic sequencing on California sea lion dental calculus to reconstruct the microbial community and link changes in microbial diversity to human activity. The investigators also perform in-solution DNA capture on specimens with Klebsiella pneumoniae to determine which strains are present. By investigating the oral microbiomes of California sea lions across time, the investigators assess whether any human-mediated alteration to the microbiome allowed for easier transmission of Klebsiella pneumoniae into the sea lion population.

"Modern farmers face an ever-growing list of challenges. Many of these issues, such as more severe weather, will require them to change how they farm.  Creating a protective layer over soil when growing field crops could help farmers better manage many issues at once. Covering soil with sheet plastic prevents weed growth, erosion, and moisture loss. But, using large amounts plastic creates waste, is not eco-friendly, and too costly for field crops.  New locally sourced types of bioplastics that fully break down into to safe by-products can be made.  These new materials could provide farmers with a green way to control weeds, fertilize crops, protect soil and water resources, and work with nature to better manage their fields. This National Science Foundation Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (NSF RII Track-2 FEC) award will be a new partnership called BioWRAP between Kansas State University, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, and University of Nebraska.  This project will be focused on advancing farm use of bioplastics. Teams will do this by linking natural and man-made systems, stopping harmful weed-crop-till cycles, and helping build green rural industries.  The team will use lab and field trials, novel analytics and products, and the links between people, farms, industries, and natural systems to help change how we grow field crops for the better. Our goal is to create an all-in-one system that can better manage weeds, nutrients, soils, and water resources. The project will provide support for five early career faculty and three post-docs. It will also provide learning resources to students of all ages and people on farms and in rural areas.                                                            

This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (RII Track-2 FEC) award will be a new partnership focused on a project called BioWRAP (Bioplastics with Regenerative Agricultural Properties) between Kansas State University, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, and University of Nebraska. The overarching goal of this project is to reduce the use of conventional plastics, herbicides, and their associated environmental impacts in agricultural production. This goal will be accomplished through the following integrated thrust areas: (i) create a set of bio-based polymers that can be used in agricultural production; (ii) measure the agricultural effectiveness and associated environmental impacts of the technology; and (iii) estimate the potential social and economic impacts on communities and the agricultural economy of the proposed technology along with establishing a consortium for sustained collaborations among university partners in Kansas, South Dakota, and Nebraska in the field of spray-on biopolymer based films for agricultural production. The research will include: engineering biopolymers included functionalized PHA-based biopolymers, protein based sprayable biopolymers, and hybrid polymer systems; studying the impact of this technology on strengthening of agroecosystems by evaluation of biopolymer with respect to weed suppression and crop production efficiency, nutrient cycling, soil moisture retention and life cycle impacts along with environmental accounting; and assessing the broader impacts of the new BioWRAP technology using socio-economic analysis of product adoption and rural sustainability along with valuing ecosystem services provided by BioWRAP, ecosystem service market design and participation and its impact on socio-economics of participating EPSCoR states as well as overall sustainable data provision of the project. The research activities designed for the project enable industry engagement and potential career opportunities for students in industries. The program includes mentoring of five junior faculty and three post docs by senior faculty in advancing through their careers and guiding students at different stages of education (graduate, undergraduate, and high and middle school) and engaging with rural communities through field days, surveys, interviews, and educational outreach activities.

"Non-technical Description: Plasmonic metasurfaces are two-dimensional nanoantenna arrays that can control the propagation of light. They are ultrathin, easy to fabricate and feature superior nonlinear optical properties compared with bulky materials. For example, such nanomaterials can be used convert coherent light from one color to another. This process is important for emerging applications in quantum communications, computing, and sensing. This project focuses on the design, fabrication, and characterization of plasmonic metasurfaces that can concentrate light over a broad color range and efficiently convert coherent light between different colors. The PI will also develop a scalable, low-cost approach to create flexible ultrathin nanomaterials with a biocompatible microporous structure for biosensing and imaging. The project will advance STEM education through an engaging undergraduate photonics course that connects photonics and nanotechnology to real-world applications. The PI will promote educational diversity by actively participating in local K-12 STEM events and recruit underrepresented students to the research team. The scientific outcomes of this project will be disseminated to a broad audience through creative exhibits in the science festival and outreach activities for K-12 students.

Technical Description: Simultaneous nanolocalized enhancement of excitation and emission transitions in nonlinear processes remains a challenge in nanophotonics research but can offer many applications in coherent light conversion, imaging, sensing, quantum optics, and spectroscopy. To address this challenge, the research team proposes to develop a new type of ultrathin nonlinear plasmonic metasurfaces, consisting of periodic metal-dielectric nanoantenna nanomaterials, to enhance nonlinear coherent light conversion processes, including second harmonic generation (SHG) and third harmonic generation (THG). The research objectives include: (1) Elucidating the structure-property relationships in engineering multiresonant optical properties of nonlinear plasmonic metasurfaces; (2) Determining SHG and THG responses from nonlinear plasmonic metasurfaces with multiresonant composite enhancement; (3) Developing a scalable, low-cost nanofabrication approach to integrating ultrathin nonlinear plasmonic metasurfaces with biocompatible flexible polymeric meshes. This research can advance fundamental knowledge in nonlinear nanophotonics by revealing the relationship between geometry-material-resonance characteristics in plasmonic metasurfaces and their nonlinear light conversion performance. This project can generate practical insights into rational design and scalable nanofabrication methods to create flexible plasmonic metasurface meshes for bio-interfaced nonlinear optical sensing and imaging applications.

"Scientific specimens, collected over multiple centuries, and their associated data represent a body of research and knowledge about biodiversity.  However most of them are still not readily accessible or readily usable; thus, hampering efforts to address biodiversity questions. It is often the biodiversity data from regionally focused small institutions that are inaccessible, despite their importance. Such an institution is the Claude E. Phillips Herbarium in Delaware, which houses over 200,000 specimens from all major plant groups. These specimens were collected locally on the Delmarva Peninsula as well as nationally and globally over the last 200 years, and represent valuable resources for research and education. This project will digitize about 130,000 plant specimens to help fill gaps in herbarium specimen digitization. The mobilized data are particularly significant in their geographic, taxonomic, and temporal coverage and will provide baseline information to assess patterns and trends in biodiversity across space and time. At the same time, the project will also train the next generation of the herbarium workforce to help ensure that centuries of botanical legacy will be cared for and will continue to provide long-term benefits.

To increase accessibility of biodiversity data, the project will produce about 130,000 high resolution specimen images and a database of both transcribed specimen metadata and georeferenced localities, all of which will be released online for public access through iDigBio (idigbio.org) and the Consortium of Mid-Atlantic Herbaria's Symbiota portal (midatlanticherbaria.org). In parallel with, and aided by, the digitization process, a curatorial upgrade will be undertaken to modernize collections care and management at the Claude E. Phillips Herbarium, with the ultimate goals of improving curation and customer service as well as promoting usage and sustainability of the collections. Training of undergraduate students at Delaware State University is an integral part of the project and will expand participation of groups still underrepresented in STEM, particularly natural history. Project personnel will be involved in all aspects of digitization and curation. Meanwhile, access to the mobilized data will enable further educational and research opportunities both within and outside the institution. The project will also contribute to regional capacity building by engaging the public through workshops, tours, crowdsourcing, and other outreach events.

"Seal whisker sensing has recently attracted increasing research interest because of its extraordinary sensitivity and accuracy. Behavioral studies have demonstrated that blindfolded seals are able to use their uniquely-shaped whiskers to track hydrodynamic trails that were generated several minutes ago and discriminate the size and shape of upstream objects through their wakes. However, relatively little is known regarding the fundamental mechanisms driving the extraordinary sensing capabilities. The principal aim of this project is to advance our understanding of seal whisker sensing that result from its unique geometry by elucidating the roles of each geometric feature. The acquired knowledge will be transformative by inspiring innovative passive hydrodynamic sensing mechanisms associated with seal whisker geometry. The research will be integrated with a creative, bio-inspired engineering education plan to impact undergraduate and graduate engineering students, as well as students in grades 3-12, and the general public.

The research will employ numerical fluid-structure interaction simulations to comprehensively characterize the individual and interactive effects of the geometric features of seal whisker on three aspects of its sensing, including (1) self-induced noises in calm waters caused by vortex-induced vibrations, (2) wake detection through wake-induced vibrations, and (3) whisker array signals. An in-house immersed-boundary-method based fluid-structure interaction solver will be used for parametric simulations of vortex-induced vibrations and wake-induced vibrations of a single whisker and multiple whiskers in wide ranges of geometric and flow parameters. The simulation results will be validated by comparing to the previously-obtained experimental measurements using the particle image velocimetry. The amplitude and frequency responses of the vibrations of different geometric models will be characterized in the parametric space. Empirical functions for vibration response characterizations will be derived. The underlying vortex dynamics and energy transfer mechanisms in terms of the interactions between the fluid forces and body displacement will be studied for understanding the vibration responses. The knowledge will not only inspire innovative hydrodynamic sensing mechanisms based on seal whisker geometry, but also contribute to the fundamental understanding of flow-induced vibration properties of bluff and slender bodies, which can have applications across broad engineering fields. The research will also investigate the signal patterns in the whisker arrays and their relationships with wake characteristics, which will have implications regarding the impact of array architecture in capturing wake information.

"Several human populations, each with distinct histories, have adapted to harsh high-altitude environments over the course of thousands of years. This doctoral dissertation research project compares the physiologies of two high-altitude populations and assesses the extent to which they have adapted similarly or differently to the same environmental stressor – low oxygen. Using the same methods, measured in populations thousands of miles apart at the same elevation thousands of feet above sea level, the project takes a new approach by measuring how high-altitude adaptations work in people during physical activity. The results of the research build on a large body of previous research on this topic and provide important information about how the high-altitude adaptations in both populations have contributed to their survival over time in low-oxygen environments. The project investigators provide scientific outreach among a local community and incorporate feedback and ideas from study participants into the project. This project also provides training for undergraduate and graduate students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines.

Some highland populations have resided in hypoxic environments for thousands of years, promoting stable evolutionary changes in aspects of their biology related to oxygen transport and delivery. Though exposed to the same selective pressure, these populations exhibit some distinct physiological adaptations, suggesting that certain historical contingencies have shaped different trajectories of trait evolution across geographic space and time. The overall objective of this project is to compare the mechanisms of improved oxygen delivery at high altitude. The central hypothesis that this study tests is that one population improves oxygen delivery primarily through increased blood oxygen content, while the other improves oxygen delivery primarily through increased blood flow. Using refined and carefully matched protocols, this project employs exercise testing, respiratory gas analysis, and hematological measurements in 70 individuals from each population to test this hypothesis. The results of this research contribute to a large body of research on human biological variation in relationship to environmental stressors, importantly through the added perspective of oxygen delivery during the stress of physical activity at high-altitude.

"The behavior, health, and digestive physiology of humans and non-human primates have evolved to meet the demands of acquiring adequate nutrition. Primarily plant-eating primates must reach nutritional requirements while coping with noxious plant compounds (plant secondary metabolites: PSMs) that are often produced in plants. Although these compounds are thought to be a strong selective force on primates, and even responsible for technological innovations in food processing and domestication in humans, we lack a clear idea of how these compounds influence the foraging, health, and digestive adaptations of wild primates. This doctoral dissertation research project examines the behavioral and physiological strategies that a wild primate species uses to cope with PSMs while reaching nutritional goals. This research will promote the conservation of a critically endangered species by maintaining a research presence on productive conservation land and providing local field assistants with alternative livelihoods to logging. The investigators will also provide training in laboratory and field methods to underrepresented students in STEM.

While it has become clear that the foraging behavior and health status of wild primates is linked to the nutrient composition of their foods, PSMs should also be a primary determinant of primate diets and health because of the negative effects that they can have, including reduced nutrient intake, toxicity, or even reduced reproductive success. This study uses a model system to explore how both nutrients and tannins, a common class of PSM, guide food selection through variable periods of preferred food availability and nutritional status, and throughout the course of development. Tannins are thought to be detrimental to consumers because they bind and reduce dietary protein, and the primates studied in this project depend on protein-derived energy to meet energetic demands during periods of preferred food scarcity. Tannins may thus be particularly detrimental to their health, and they may therefore have behavioral or physiological strategies to deal with them. The investigators use data on food availability, feeding behavior, nutrient composition of plant foods, and results from a qualitative assay of the effectiveness of tannins in food, to test how tannins and nutrients affect food selection and preference. The investigators also measure biomarkers of health in urine samples, including C-peptide of insulin and creatinine, to see if health status is related to intake of tannin-rich foods. Finally, they quantify tannin-binding proteins in saliva, which are thought to be produced as an adaptation to cope with dietary tannins. Overall, the results of this project provide important knowledge regarding food availability, preferences and nutritional and health related consequences in primates.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to develop a viable and scalable process to manufacture a bamboo-based strand composite for application in low-cost roofing globally.  This project develops a new production process for exterior-grade natural fiber composite building products, derived from a highly renewable resource, bamboo, through public-private partnership.  The resulting roofing product will help protect users from extreme heat by passively cooling and reducing indoor temperatures. In addition, this solution can be used to create value-added energy-efficient building products from highly renewable natural fiber waste. The innovation holds immense potential to replace harmful and hazardous materials, including asbestos, in many regions of the world, store captured carbon into long-lifecycle products, and reduce heating and cooling energy use.

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will: (i) refine the design of the 3D panel geometry used to make commercial-size panels with improved load-carrying capacity and constructability; (ii) improve the bamboo-stranding process, evaluate a bio-based adhesive system, impart fire-retardance, enhance panel durability, manufacture panels using the new geometry, and evaluate performance; and (iii) demonstrate and evaluate panel use as a roofing material through field tests and the versatility of the corrugated panel in interior and exterior energy-efficient building products. This research will advance the field of natural fiber composites by addressing challenges of long-term construction applications that can withstand hot and humid climates, including moisture resistance, biodegradation, and effective binders for functionality.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the worldwide issue of how biofouling (unwanted attachment of biological species, e.g., barnacles, oysters, mussels) of ships is addressed. The current antifouling methods are harmful to the environment (toxic paints are employed and they can pollute waterways) and costly in terms of maintenance to mitigate biofouling and the increased fuel costs due to frictional drag during a vessel’s operation. This project seeks to develop an innovative, electronic approach to biofouling prevention by developing ultrasonic transducer arrays that are optimized for submerged operation in a marina. The near-term commercial opportunity is with both marina owners and nationwide marina operators. Over time and with further product development, commercial transport and large Navy vessels may also be addressed. This project seeks to enhance the scientific understanding of acoustic wave generation in water using piezoelectric transducers and sensor arrays along with the understanding of how these waves prevent the attachment of bio-species to ship hulls.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to address the challenges of commercial deployment of transducer and sensor arrays to prevent biofouling of ships docked in marinas. The program has four scientific objectives: 1) Improve transducer and power amplifier components and construction to maximize sound pressure levels in water; 2) Develop and construct complex coherent transducer arrays to project adequate sound pressure levels at distances greater than 10 feet to prevent biofouling agents from attaching to ships; 3) Integrate sensor arrays into an autonomous system that can adjust sound pressure levels based on feedback algorithms; and 4) Develop a proof-of-concept system to adopt an autonomous, electronically steerable transducer array system to the interior of boat hulls. This latter adaptation may open markets where large ships such as commercial transport and Naval vessels can be addressed.  The project will innovate in areas such as acoustic beam steering, electronic design of piezoelectric transducers, acoustic amplifier design, submersible marine electronics, and electro/mechanical design for submersible housings.

"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).

Although 5G has dramatically improved network capacity and spectrum efficiency (SE), the explosive growth of Internet of Things (IoT) demands for more spectrum and energy resources to support high device density and massive traffics. It is estimated that at least 5.2 GHz bandwidth is required for just eHealth Care IoT if spectrum is accessed exclusively, or 1.3 GHz even with dynamic sharing strategy. It is clear that shortage of spectrum resources is a major bottleneck for the success of IoT popularity. On the other hand, current IoT devices use standards such as Bluetooth, LoRA, Sigfox, narrow-band IoT (NB-IoT), or Zigbee, which require power-hungry active radio frequency components like oscillators and converters. Battery-driven IoT devices can hardly sustain years of life-cycle goal even with infrequent transmission and optimized low-power protocols. Thus, sustainable energy consumption is another challenge. With tens of billions of IoTs desire for connectivity by 2030, there is a pressing need to address both SE and energy efficiency (EE) challenges to accommodate for such densified IoT networks. This research seeks to improve SE and EE performance while providing guaranteed quality of service (QoS) for IoTs at large-scale, thereby providing a feasible and practical connectivity solution in massive IoT era. Outcomes from this project can bring following impacts: 1) a hybrid and cooperative communication architect for IoTs, which combines benefits from both active and passive mode; 2) integration of research and curriculum design, capstone projects to both undergraduate and graduate students; 3) cutting-edge research experiences to a primarily undergraduate institution (PUI). 

The core approach is to enable IoT device with a wireless-powered hybrid communication structure that can not only minimize energy footprint with energy harvesting from ambient signals, but also integrate coordinated passive and active communication to support versatile QoS needs with efficient spectrum utilization through user cooperation. This project offers a holistic solution to deliver following innovations. 1) A novel PHY transmission architect. It combines a bio-inspired symbiotic radio to coordinate excessive interference. Optimization problems for SE and EE metrics are introduced from PHY resource allocation perspective. 2) The co-designed MAC layer protocol to ensure proper user and resource coordination. Two protocols will be introduced, one for maximum performance and the other for lower complexity. 3) System validation with software and hardware implementations. Extensive experimental verification is designed to systematically validate the performance of proposed schemes and algorithms.

"This award will support a virtual workshop March 24th-25th, 2022, to coach early-career faculty on best practices and rhetorical patterns used in successful writing of research proposals in biomedical engineering.  The ability to write research proposals is critical to early-career researchers’ success, yet there is little formalized coaching in the technical writing skills necessary to craft a successful research proposal. Those that do exist tend to focus on content and editing, without discussing the rhetorical patterns that are common to award-winning applications. Rhetorical patterns are ways of organizing information. Successful proposal writing has its own rhetorical patterns.  The “How to Write a CAREER: Deconstructing the Award” workshop will emphasize these rhetorical patterns and the importance of mentorship to gain mastery of them. First, NSF CAREER awards related to biomedical or bioengineering will be deconstructed by a communications science expert. Second, the identified common rhetorical elements will provide the foundation for workshop materials and participants will receive actionable and practical information. This proposal-writing workshop will coach early career faculty to be better proposal writers by identifying the language structure that is common across successful proposals and teaching them how to apply that structure to their own proposals. Participants, with priority given to those underrepresented in engineering, will be well positioned to submit competitive CAREER proposals, which has the potential for broadening participation.

This workshop will advance knowledge related to NSF CAREER proposal writing in bio- and biomedical engineering from the perspective of rhetorical patterns. Rhetorical patterns in scientific writing are also influenced by sociocultural variables. For instance, women are socialized to not brag, despite the importance of using rhetorical devices to add promotional value to one’s research articles to convince peers of its value. Novice and non-native English technical writers can make better rhetorical choices when informed of rhetorical patterns. Rhetorical patterns are ways of organizing and communicating information and are critical to the clear presentation of scientific information. When English adjectives deviate from the order “opinion-size-age-shape-color-origin-material-purpose Noun,” a native English speaker will recognize that the sentence is odd but would likely be unable to articulate this list. Similarly, experienced proposal writers and reviewers understand correct rhetorical patterns in technical writing without necessarily being able to impart it to early career investigators. Just as incorrect word order reveals non-native English speakers, proposal writers who deviate from expected rhetorical patterns are identified as “non-native proposal writers.” The rhetoric of science contends that the practice of science is persuasive—in proposal writing, the author must convince reviewers that their research is based on sound scientific method or engineering principles. The rhetorical patterns in such writing involve patterns called “situation-problem-solution-evaluation” that showcase the researcher’s observational and experimental competence while demonstrating explanatory and predictive power. If these rhetorical patterns are not mastered, the likelihood of funding may be affected despite the competence of the researcher. Teaching proposal-writing by employing the most successful use of rhetorical patterns may lessen the impact of sociocultural differences in proposal review.

"This doctoral dissertation project examines the early diversification of apes within the broader context of mammalian community evolution. Leveraging rich fossil collections, the investigators characterize mammal assemblages from multiple, well-studied localities to examine how time, space and environmental factors impacted mammalian community structure. The scientific importance of this project lies in providing a comparative backdrop of mammalian evolution to better understand the ecological setting for major adaptations in the ape and human lineage. More broadly, this project can have significant impacts for science and society by expanding participation in science through graduate training and research opportunities for undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM research. A relational database of paleontological data assembled through this project is planned for public distribution to scientists and educators via the Data Repository at the University of Minnesota (DRUM). Other results will be made available through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and public outreach opportunities aimed at providing scientific engagement at public schools and museums. 

The early divergence of ape lineages, during which several major adaptive characteristics of the ape-human clade were established, is primarily recorded in the early Miocene (ca. 23-16 Ma). Although fossil apes from this time have been the subject of intense study, little work has been done to properly situate the diversity of these species within the broader context of mammalian community evolution. This project asks the central question: how did environment, time, and geographic distance influence the structure of early Miocene mammalian communities? Using large fossil assemblages, this project pursues four specific questions: 1) do fossil assemblages from major collecting areas represent differences in mammalian community structure? 2) do changes in mammalian community structure track environmental differences inferred from associated paleoecological proxies? 3) are mammalian community structures most similar among assemblages that are closest in age? and 4) does similarity in mammalian community structure decrease with increasing geographic distance between assemblages? These questions are addressed by analyzing the mammalian community structure across 13 fossil localities that are already well-characterized in terms of age and paleoenvironment. By situating mammalian community succession within temporal, geographic, and environmental contexts, this project can inform our understanding of how these factors influenced changes among mammal species, thereby clarifying the ecological parameters within which major adaptations in the ape and human lineage arose.

"This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will support research that will enable the large-scale manipulation of nano-sized objects by using a shared external electric field, and, as such, it will have strong potential to impact important applications in the development of new materials, drug-delivery and medical devices, and electronics. Nanomanipulation enables the flexible maneuvering and precise positioning of nanostructures in both prototyping and assembling nanoscale devices. However, current nanomanipulation techniques are not well-suited for independently manipulating large numbers of nanoscale objects precisely and reliably. Overcoming existing barriers will allow the efficient manufacture of inexpensive functional nanodevices. This award will generate the fundamental knowledge, methodologies, and tools for large-volume manipulation of a broad class of micro- and nano-scale objects, by focusing on using coupled external electric fields to perform nanomanipulation in three-dimensional microfluidic environments. Additionally, this research will lead to efficient and inexpensive neuromorphic nanowire networks that mimic the behaviors exhibited by biological neurons. These advances could revolutionize neuromorphic computing as applied to next-generation artificial intelligence hardware, making the nation more competitive in the field of artificial intelligence. The research will be integrated with education at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and lifelong learning levels. The outreach activities will prime the STEM pipeline and inspire women and underrepresented minorities towards STEM careers.

The ability to move and control large numbers of micro- and nano-scale objects has important industrial and biomedical applications. However, automation has been mostly restricted to moving a limited number of objects in small workspace volumes. This research aims to discover motion-control frameworks that serve to simultaneously, but independently, manipulate many nano-sized objects under coupled external electric fields. The research objectives are to (1) design an adaptive robust ensemble control for great quantities of agents in a complex three-dimensional microfluidic environment under common electric fields; (2) analyze the controllability and manipulability of the system to identify the most effective electrode pattern and plan efficient trajectories of individual objects; and (3) investigate control schemes that enable functional nanodevice assembly with applications to next-generation neuromorphic computing. In the long term, this research will support engineering tools for automated microscale and nanoscale bio-factories through the manipulation of large volumes of objects, which will have significant impacts on target-oriented drug delivery and precision medicine engineering.

"This project addresses Indigenous food security in Alaska through the study of subterranean food caches in three Alaska Native communities. Underground food storage and preservation are critical to subsistence and food security for many Alaska Native households. However, permafrost thaw and subsidence are causing many caches to collapse or flood. Employing community-based participatory research, the PI team will document current and past use of food caches ethnographically and identify emerging food storage and preservation challenges. The condition and integrity of existing caches will be assessed using environmental science methods. 

This mixed-methods project employs both ethnographic methods and environmental science data collection and analysis. Members of the research team will conduct participant observation and oral history interviews in three Alaska Native villages with traditions of underground storage. With community assistance, caches will be identified and documented. The condition of select caches will be monitored to detect subsidence and to measure temperature, humidity, and rate of permafrost thaw. Bio- and geochemical analyses will enable researchers to characterize permafrost composition and hydrology. The project team will work with community partners to interpret project findings and develop outreach materials such as booklets, posters, and classroom curricula. Results will also be disseminated via conference presentations and peer-reviewed articles.

"This project will preserve and improve access to the Joseph F. Rock Herbarium at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa through digitization of its 55,000 specimens. Hawaiʻi has some of the greatest biodiversity in the United States, particularly when it comes to its native plants: 90% are found nowhere else in the world. A high proportion of these plants are listed as threatened or endangered, and many have gone extinct in the last century. Natural history collections serve as invaluable records of biodiversity and are important references for species that are threatened, endangered, or otherwise difficult to access. The Joseph F. Rock herbarium is one of the oldest herbaria in the Pacific and is home to rare and endemic species of the Hawaiian and Pacific islands. The newly digitized specimens will be available to researchers across the globe, greatly increasing the utility of the collection. Digitization will be conducted by undergraduates at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa to provide meaningful research experiences for students. The herbarium will host volunteer digitization events, increase collaboration with the campus arboretum, and engage with the public via events at a local botanical garden.

The rare and endemic Hawaiian and Pacific island plant specimens in the Rock herbarium will be preserved through overall modernization of the collection. Specifically, this project will digitize the 55,000 specimens in the collection, remove the backlog of specimens that need to be accessioned, and disseminate specimen data to a broader research community through a dedicated Consortium of Pacific Herbaria web portal and iDigBio.org. Modernization will also include expanded pest management and expanding the throughput of specimen digitization. The project additionally serves to maintain and strengthen collaborations across Pacific herbaria and promote digitization of other, smaller collections. The project will employ nine students each year, emphasizing the training and retention of students from historically excluded groups, including Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. Outreach efforts will focus on connecting preserved specimens to living collections on the University of Hawaiʻi Campus Arboretum and Lyon Arboretum and continuing efforts to connect the herbarium to Hawaiian culture and knowledge.

This project is jointly funded by the Capacity: Biological Collections Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"Water requirements shape the behaviors and ways in which all animals interact with their environment. Access to sufficient clean water is especially important for maintaining hydration in lactating mammalian mothers. Many primate mothers produce a dilute milk over an extended period, which may present challenges to maintaining water balance in lactating females. This doctoral dissertation research project explores hydration status and water consumption behaviors in wild female primates and provides a comprehensive look at the multiple variables that can influence their water balance. This study also documents water quality, availability, and location in the context of frequent human-animal interactions and therefore has important implications for public health. Understanding hydration, how it varies based on ecological contexts, as well as how primates meet their water requirements has implications for the conservation of endangered populations that face changing environments. This project provides numerous training opportunities and supports capacity building. Results are shared through scientific journals, social media, and educational efforts in multiple settings.

This project tests the hypothesis that lactating female primates are more water stressed than other individuals in their group and alter their behavior to increase their water intake. It also tests the hypothesis that high-ranking females are buffered from lactation-related water stress due to their increased access to better quality food and water compared to low-ranking females. This project maps spatiotemporal variation in water availability and quality, both in food and free-standing water, across the primates’ habitat. Using behavioral observations and nutritional data, the researchers estimate water intake by lactating females. Using the collected physiological and behavioral data, the results clarify how water balance varies in females based on their reproductive state, dominance rank, and the water quality and availability in their home range. This project integrates new behavioral, physiological, ecological, spatiotemporal, and nutritional data to explore water balance and behavioral adaptations to hydration stress in an endangered primate species.

"Zooplankton, small animals that drift with ocean currents, are critical links in marine food webs. Many different types of zooplankton have elongated spines, horns, or hairs. These structures are thought of as predator deterrents or sensory antennae. This project examines other ecologically important functions that spines might impact: feeding, swimming, sinking, and dislodgement from surfaces.  These functions depend on how animals interact with the water around them. This study investigates how spines work to alter the movement of the surrounding water and how that water movement varies in the early development of the “nauplius” larval stage of different species of barnacles. Barnacles are a type of crustacean, a group that includes the commercially important crabs, shrimp, and lobsters. Since all crustaceans have a nauplius larval stage, this research will shed light on how this common body form operates, providing information about functional tradeoffs between different behaviors and body shapes. This project -- a collaboration between a small, liberal arts undergraduate college and a big research university -- brings together students and faculty from both to conduct the research and to train undergraduates. In addition, this project crosses disciplinary boundaries between biology and engineering, so students from different fields will learn how to communicate and collaborate. Principles discovered from this study can inform bio-inspired design of aquatic microrobots. The types of experiments designed will also be used to develop new science curricula.  

Diverse zooplankters bear spines with functions that are poorly understood. This study of the hydrodynamics of different species of barnacle larvae will determine (1) functional consequences of the presence, location, and morphology of spines on hydrodynamic forces and torques; (2) functional consequences of spines and appendage kinematics on the forces and torques generated, and on swimming, sinking, and feeding performance; and (3) hydrodynamic consequences of the change in body design from the planktonic nauplius to the settling cyprid form.  Kinematics and flow fields of larvae with distinctive morphologies and ecology are measured using micro-videography and high-speed particle image velocimetry. This comparative study on live organisms is coupled with experiments using dynamically scaled physical models to determine mechanisms by which specific features control forces and torques on, and flow fields around, larvae. Physical models allow parameters – spine size and shape;  body size and shape; limb morphology; and kinematics -- to be varied in ways not possible with living organisms. In addition to elucidating general principles about the hydrodynamic consequences of spines at the poorly understood size and speed range of zooplankton – the domain of intermediate Reynolds numbers -- the project will advance understanding of how tradeoffs between ecological functions impose biomechanical constraints that can shape the evolution of form. Collaboration between a PUI college and R1 university integrates research and undergraduate education at both. The question-driven, experience-based learning approach involves research teams of undergraduates from physical and biological sciences to develop their skills at interdisciplinary collaboration. Novel interdisciplinary course materials will be developed with context-rich modules for teaching quantitative skills.

This project -- a collaboration between a small, liberal arts undergraduate college and a big research university -- brings together students and faculty from both to conduct the research and to train undergraduates. In addition, this project crosses disciplinary boundaries between biology and engineering, so students from different fields will learn how to communicate and collaborate. Principles discovered from this study can inform bio-inspired design of aquatic microrobots. The types of experiments designed will also be used to develop new science curricula.  
Diverse zooplankters bear spines with functions that are poorly understood. This study of the hydrodynamics of different species of barnacle larvae will determine (1) functional consequences of the presence, location, and morphology of spines on hydrodynamic forces and torques; (2) functional consequences of spines and appendage kinematics on the forces and torques generated, and on swimming, sinking, and feeding performance; and (3) hydrodynamic consequences of the change in body design from the planktonic nauplius to the settling cyprid form.  Kinematics and flow fields of larvae with distinctive morphologies and ecology are measured using micro-videography and high-speed particle image velocimetry. This comparative study on live organisms is coupled with experiments using dynamically scaled physical models to determine mechanisms by which specific features control forces and torques on, and flow fields around, larvae. Physical models allow parameters – spine size and shape;  body size and shape; limb morphology; and kinematics -- to be varied in ways not possible with living organisms. In addition to elucidating general principles about the hydrodynamic consequences of spines at the poorly understood size and speed range of zooplankton – the domain of intermediate Reynolds numbers -- the project will advance understanding of how tradeoffs between ecological functions impose biomechanical constraints that can shape the evolution of form. Collaboration between a PUI college and R1 university integrates research and undergraduate education at both. The question-driven, experience-based learning approach involves research teams of undergraduates from physical and biological sciences to develop their skills at interdisciplinary collaboration. Novel interdisciplinary course materials will be developed with context-rich modules for teaching quantitative skills.

"Biological fluids such as mucous can behave like elastic solids or complex viscous liquid depending on the applied stress.  The goal of this project is to understand the fluid mechanics of bacterial swimming in model complex fluids that resemble biological fluids. This comprehensive theoretical, computational, and experimental study will fill an important knowledge gap in understanding the relationship between the properties of biological fluids and the mechanics of bacterial motility. Swimming capabilities significantly contribute to the virulence of pathogenic bacteria by allowing them to reach the plasma membrane of susceptible cells and cause systemic infections. Therefore, data acquired in the project will be useful to researchers who want to mitigate or treat bacterial diseases.  It will also be crucial for bioengineers aiming to deliver drugs via bacteria or synthetic swimmers.  In addition, the project will provide outreach that inspires interest in engineering among K-12 students by illustrating the societal impact of engineering science. 

Bacterial motility in biological fluids such as mucous is complicated by the presence of a yield stress, a minimal stress necessary to deform the fluid, the coupled viscous and elastic responses of the fluid, and the non-continuum nature arising because the bacterium’s flagella have a thickness comparable with the spacing between mucus strands.  A novel computational approach accounting for this complex rheology will capture the bacterium cell using an immersed boundary method and the bundle of flagella using slender-body theory.  The solvent and polymer will be modeled as two interpenetrating fluids with the thin flagella exerting their stresses directly only on the solvent.   In complementary experiments, nanoparticle organic hybrid bio-compatible materials will be designed with rheology and structure that mimic the biological fluids.  Dark-field and phase-contrast microscopy of suspensions of E. coli will provide statistically accurate measurements of the swimming speed and cell rotation rate distribution.  In microscopy tracking individual cells, separate fluorescent dyes will enable the determination of the different rotation rates of the cell and flagella bundle.  Observations in Newtonian fluids will be used to characterize the rotary motors that drive the flagella. The motility measurements will be performed in collaboration with Professor Wilson Poon at the University of Edinburgh.  The experiments will determine the criterion for cells to swim, the speed of cells that do swim, and the distinct resistances the non-continuum fluid exert on the cell and flagella, thereby testing three crucial predictions of the computation and theory.

"Computational simulation of natural phenomena is a ubiquitous tool in the natural sciences (environmental modeling, prediction of earthquakes or avalanches), bio-mechanics (modeling the musculoskeletal system, organ function, or tissue damage), manufacturing (product design, prototyping, and verification) as well as in computer graphics/animation. This project advances the science of simulation using a technique called Material Point Methods (MPM), by increasing the number of materials and range of phenomena that can be simulated, and optimizing the performance of numerical algorithms used for simulations at larger scales. The enhancements from this project will enable studies in terrain dynamics, design and prototyping of vehicles and agricultural implements interacting with complex soils, modeling of material failure and fracture scenarios including biological settings such as skin tearing, surgical incisions, or vascular rupture. The optimization and scaling will allow computational studies of simulated physical systems at levels of resolution that were previously only afforded to large enterprises.

This project extends MPM simulation to: a) materials with multi-phase interactions influenced by thermodynamics; and b) media with complex multi-scale geometric features, including porosity (e.g. water-soil interactions) or aggregates dominated by grains of non-spherical geometry. This project extends MPM simulation to phenomena that include intricate frictional contact (beyond the no-slip contact model embedded in traditional MPM), dynamic crack propagation, and de-cohesion. This research thread leverages the team's prior work on non-manifold data structures for storing implicit geometry representations, allowing the background grids of MPM to incorporate a richer set of topological features (e.g. tears and incisions) than those incorporated by conventional array-based regular lattices. Finally, this research boosts the scale of MPM simulations that can be accommodated in modern multiprocessors, improving detail, resolution as well as parallel efficiency.

"Dust aerosols affect global climate by partially absorbing and reflecting incoming sunlight and heat energy emitted by the atmosphere and the surface. The optical properties of dust particles are critical to reducing uncertainties in the current knowledge of the role of dust aerosols in the climate system, and thus are important for predicting future climate. The dust particle optical properties are also fundamental for inferring dust aerosol characteristics from space-borne and ground-based remote sensing observations. Dust particles are almost exclusively nonspherical. It has been extensively demonstrated that the spheroidal particle shape model represents a quantum leap forward, compared to the spherical model, for computing the optical properties of nonspherical particles. At present, the optical properties of small-to-large particles can be computed only for spheres. There is a pressing need to have an exact and robust computational capability to compute the optical properties of spheroidal particles. Leveraging advances in computational mathematics, advances in electromagnetic scattering theories, and modern computer technologies and computer coding techniques, this project aims to develop a novel program to compute the optical properties of spheroidal particle in the small-to-large particle size range. Because many bacteria, microweeds, oceanic particles, and interstellar dust particles have approximately spheroidal shapes, the outcome of this project will also find extensive applications in climate science (particularly the radiative energy budget in the climate system), remote sensing, industry, bio-optics, oceanic optics, astrophysics, planetary sciences, and other fields beyond atmospheric sciences. Because this project focuses on a major unsolved interdisciplinary problem and because of significant challenges, particularly from the perspective of computational electromagnetics and mathematics, this project is exploratory but potentially transformative, i.e., “high risk – high payoff”. In addition to its scientific merit, this project contains an educational component to train an early-career researcher in the interdisciplinary area mentioned above. 

This project aims to solve light scattering by a spheroid in spheroidal coordinates. Although solving the electromagnetic wave equation via the method of separation of variables in spheroid coordinates has been explored, the previously developed models are applicable only to particles that are small with respect to the incident wavelength and have little practical use. The major challenge encountered by the previous effort is numerical instability of spheroidal harmonic functions. This project will seek to achieve numerical stability of spheroidal harmonic functions by using advanced algorithms, such as expressing spheroidal functions in terms of the Wigner-d function. The key to computing spheroidal functions is to find eigenvalues of corresponding spheroidal equations. The radial and angular spheroidal equations are of the Sturm-Liouville type. The eigenvalues will be calculated by the invariant-imbedding method, which is expected to be numerically stable and accurate. Thus, the spheroidal functions are expected to be accurate even with extreme parameters. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a numerically stable capability for accurately computing the optical properties of a spheroid beyond the currently applicable particle size and aspect ratio ranges of other existing computational capabilities, such as the discrete dipole approximation method (DDA), the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method, the extended boundary condition method (EBCM), and the invariant imbedding T-matrix method (IITM).

"Nanomaterials may interact with human cells, due to the  unintended release of nanomaterials into the environment (through air and water pollution), or intentionally in applications of nanomaterials for treating diseases such as cancer. Exposure of cells to nanomaterials can have dose-dependent beneficial or harmful effects. These effects are traditionally evaluated with biochemical assays such as cell viability and membrane integrity assays. However, these approaches neglect the impact of nanomaterials on the cell’s actin cytoskeleton, the “bone structure” of the cells. This CAREER project will generate new knowledge about how low-level metal-based nanoparticles impact the actin cytoskeleton in normal and cancer cells. The potential impact of this project will be in offering a sensitive and quantitative platform based on actin cytoskeleton of cells for nanomaterial safety assessment, thus enabling the establishment of regulatory and manufacturing frameworks for safe and sustainable nanomaterials. The project will also potentially lead to safe, effective, and versatile approaches for using nanomaterials to treat cancer metastasis (the cause of 90% of human cancer deaths). The research-integrated educational plan in this project places a strong emphasis on educating First-Generation College Students and Native American Students, two underrepresented groups in South Dakota currently exhibiting high dropout rates. Through well-planned summer research experiences, a total of 10 students from these two groups are expected to acquire valuable hands-on skills in the fields of chemistry, biology, materials science, and nanobiotechnology, as well as enhanced academic persistence in completing their STEM education. The PI will also conduct a workshop series entitled “SEE NANO” at Tribal Colleges and integrate visually appealing and scientifically interesting research results with Flipped Classroom Methodology to make STEM classrooms more enjoyable and engaging, thereby promoting active learning and retention in STEM fields.


Most research on nanomaterial cytotoxicity relies on macroscopic biochemical assays, including cell viability and membrane integrity assays, without considering that nanoscale interactions with nanomaterials, even at low levels, can alter the actin cytoskeleton of cells. There is a knowledge gap concerning how the actin cytoskeleton of cells is affected by low concentrations of nanomaterials, when cell viability and membrane integrity have not been changed. The overall research goal of this CAREER project is to determine how low-level metal-based nanoparticles affect the actin cytoskeleton in normal and cancer cells, and to apply this knowledge to tune their impact on the actin cytoskeleton for inhibition of cancer cell migration without impacting normal cells. The overarching hypothesis is that the interaction mechanism of metal-based nanoparticles with actin cytoskeleton will be dependent on their surface functionality and intracellular degradability, and these properties can be tuned to selectively disrupt the actin cytoskeleton in cancer cells without affecting the actin cytoskeleton in normal cells. Specifically, this project will focus on two model metal-based nanoparticles including metal-organic frameworks and gold nanoparticles. Objective 1 will determine how low-level metal-based nanoparticles affect the actin structures and functions of vascular cells. Objective 2 will reveal the mechanisms of how these nanoparticles alter the actin structures and migration ability of cancer cells. Finally, Objective 3 will predict and tune the impact of nanomaterials on the actin cytoskeleton in vascular and cancer cells by combining atomic force microscopy techniques with surface functionalization of nanoparticles. The actin cytoskeleton changes induced by the nanoparticles will be resolved by nanomechanical atomic force microscopy and super resolution fluorescence microscopy. The mechanistic knowledge generated from this research will lead to: (i) a sensitive platform for nanoparticle safety assessment that is based on the biophysical responses of vascular cells; and (ii) several versatile, effective, and safe approaches for stopping cancer metastasis. The educational objective of this project is to improve the retention of undergraduates in STEM education, by engaging first-year students to specific research tasks focusing on nano-bio interactions, conducting a workshop series entitled “SEE NANO” at Tribal Colleges, and bringing Flipped Classroom Methodology to STEM classrooms. The research integrated educational plan places a strong emphasis on educating First-Generation College Students and Native American Students, two underrepresented groups in South Dakota exhibiting high dropout rates after their first year. Engaging these students in research during their first summer will motivate and promote their academic persistence in completing STEM education. The PI will also integrate visually appealing and scientifically interesting research results with Flipped Classroom Methodology to make STEM classrooms more enjoyable and engaging, thereby promoting active learning and retention in STEM fields.

"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY
In materials science, strength is the measure of a material’s ability to bear a load or carry weight without failing. Alternatively, ductility is a measure of a material’s ability to bend, stretch or spread without breaking into pieces. Often, increasing the strength of a material results in a decrease of ductility and vice versa. This project supports fundamental research focused on the design of Titanium alloys that overcome this typical strength-to-ductility trade-off by carefully tailoring the elemental make-up of said alloys. This careful tailoring controls how specific parts of the metal are arranged on an atomic level to have a certain chemical composition and arrangement that increases the material’s strength without reducing the material’s overall ability to bend or stretch. This type of design is known as metastability engineering. This project investigates how parts of Titanium alloys having the same elemental makeup and atomic structure change with both temperature and chemical composition and how they deform under various circumstances. To explore this behavior, real-time and “after the fact” studies are performed using cutting edge equipment to discover connections between local chemistry, different environments and very small particles in the metal that are nanometers in size and have only recently been discovered in Titanium. The fundamental knowledge established in this project advances the ability to design lightweight Titanium alloys with both high strength and high ductility. Metastable titanium alloys are desirable for aerospace, automobile, bio-medical and chemical industries, due to their high strength-to-weight ratio, ability to absorb impact, resistance to chemical deterioration and compatibility with biological applications. As an example, relative to just one of these industries, improvements to these alloys can help to increase aircraft fuel efficiency, reduce fuel consumption, lower carbon emissions and ultimately, benefit the environment. This project also develops education modules for students in a K-12 Summer Camp as well as lab experiences for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Nevada Reno. Both sets of activities feature high powered microscopes providing students from local Reno communities exposure to science and technology while also providing opportunities for women and underrepresented minorities to learn materials science for the purpose of developing the future scientific workforce.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY
This project aims to advance a novel alloy designing strategy known as metastability engineering, by studying microstructural evolution and deformation in metastable Titanium alloys. The project will identify the critical role of the recently discovered, orthorhombic nano-precipitate, O prime (O’) in the spatially confined phase transformations of Titanium and its alloys.  Advanced ex-situ and in-situ characterization techniques are employed to explore three specific phenomena: (i) The relationship between alloy composition and O’ nano-precipitates; (ii) The role of O’ in refining precipitate microstructure; and (iii) the role of O’ in regulating martensitic transformations. Multiscale ex- and in-situ experimental characterization using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography are used.  This research progresses the ability to realize metastable alloys of Titanium having both high strength and high ductility. Education modules and outreach activities focused on electron microscopy creatively engage students in K-12, undergraduate and graduate level study. The education modules and activities are enhanced by a remote-controlled transmission electron microscope and a portable desktop scanning electron microscope to capture a wide range of interests and expose all to meaningful science. These education activities provide students in the neighboring community unprecedented access to science in real-time and offers to the student body at the University of Nevada, Reno a practical means of enhancing their in-class instruction with exposure to advanced characterization being performed at their institution. All activities assist with developing a future STEM workforce by generating interest in materials science to students at all ages.

"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY
This CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research, and educational activities that advance designer materials that mimic the adaptability of living systems and their ability to manipulate energy flows. The properties of a material arise from the collective interactions of its building blocks. In traditional materials, the building blocks are atoms or molecules whose interactions are determined by the nature of the chemical bonds among them. Modern technical advances in fabricating complex assemblies, such as 3D printing and bio-inspired self-assembly, have enabled artificial materials composed of active building blocks such as driven micromechanical resonators, miniature robots, and even bacteria whose interactions can be dynamically modulated via external means or internal power sources. By incorporating dynamic elements, these new materials can manipulate mechanical energy and transform their structural properties in ways that are unattainable in inert materials. This project will develop quantitative models that predict the collective behavior of massive assemblies of dynamic building blocks, thereby expanding capabilities to tailor the response of dynamic materials towards specific technological needs.

The PI and his research team will develop new theoretical and computational models to predict the mechanical and structural response of assemblies of building blocks whose interactions are modulated to form periodic patterns in both space and time. These models will extend physical theories which model inert materials as networks of masses connected by springs, with the novel advance that the spring stiffnesses will be varied sinusoidally by external driving agents. The new models will be used to propose designs for dynamic materials with desirable material properties targeted towards technological applications such as vibration control, shock absorption, and acoustic signal processing. For example, time-varying spring stiffnesses can enable structures that amplify sound waves traveling through the material in particular directions or transform a static solid to a spontaneously flowing liquid when a prescribed pressure is applied. In addition, this research activity will advance fundamental understanding of systems which manipulate energy flows in fields as diverse as electronics, photonics, and quantum information.

The educational component of the project will develop new pedagogical tools, activities, and programs to advance materials science knowledge among students in non-traditional academic pathways, K-12 students, beginning graduate students, and the general public. The PI and his research team will develop new hands-on activities to convey the physical principles underlying the project to participants at the Eugene Youth Math Festival, the Oregon Country Fair, and summer programs for high school students hosted by the University of Oregon. This award will support research internships for community college students who are considering a transfer to a four-year degree program, and the development of new learning modules which use scientific teaching practices to improve equity and inclusion in graduate physics courses. The educational activities are designed to enhance participation, achievement, and persistence of students from underrepresented groups in STEM while improving outcomes for students from all backgrounds.


TECHNICAL SUMMARY
This CAREER award will support research and educational activities to advance fundamental understanding and public awareness of dynamic materials that are designed to channel mechanical energy in ways unattainable by inert structures. Technological breakthroughs have enabled the fabrication of collections of interacting building blocks whose local properties can be modulated by external fields or internally powered mechanisms as desired. This opens new possibilities for non-equilibrium manipulation of mechanical energy. However, the normal modes of these dynamic materials are typically investigated using approximate methods such as plane-wave and Magnus expansions that fail to correctly capture symmetry constraints and topological features of the excitation spectra. This project will develop an exact theoretical framework to compute the band structures of spacetime-modulated mechanical systems with generalized couplings. The framework will be used for rigorous evaluations and new explorations of non-equilibrium mechanics and phase behavior, including topological properties of excitation spectra and phase changes between crystal-like ordered states in active matter. Beyond this work, the framework will be widely applicable to harmonic oscillations of dynamical systems with second-order time dynamics. By revealing new ways to control the flow of mechanical energy in classical systems, the research will advance fundamental understanding of non-Hermitian physics with relevance to manipulating energy flows in quantum condensed matter, cold atoms, and optics.

The underlying concepts and research questions will be integrated into educational activities and programs that will improve awareness of fundamental materials science and its role in technological advancement in K-12 students, undergraduate and graduate physics students, and the general public. New opportunities for materials science research will be created for community college students, thereby reinforcing pathways to STEM careers for students with non-traditional backgrounds. The research and educational plans leverage the PI's expertise in theoretical modeling of soft matter systems and existing relationships with educational and outreach organizations in and around Eugene, Oregon.

"One of the most remarkable biological machines is the rotary motor that enables bacteria to swim.  This machine is being studied in the bacterium Escherichia coli, about which more is known than any other free-living thing.  E.coli  lives in your gut.  Its cells are about 1 micrometer in diameter by 2 micrometers long -- 10,000 will fit side by side across the width of your finger.  Each cell is propelled by about 4 long thin helical filaments, each driven at its base by a rotary motor.  The filaments coalesce into a bundle behind the cell along its long axis and push it forward, nearly 20 body lengths per second.  Recent work by electron microscopy (by cryo EM) suggests that the force-generating units (stator units) that drive flagellar rotation are themselves rotary engines about 7 times smaller in diameter than the rotor of the flagellar motor, and thus should spin about 7 times faster.  This hypothesis will be tested by pulsed fluorescence bleaching, as explained below. Motility is known to enhance bacterial virulence.  However, the main thrust of this work is not to explore its medical relevance but rather to understand the fundamental science which has the potential to provide a blueprint for bio-inspired design and inspire undergraduate students to enter this rapidly growing field. 

Stator units are assembled from 5 copies of the protein MotA and 2 copies of the protein MotB, which span the cell membrane.  A MotA pentamer is thought to surround and rotate about a MotB dimer, powered by protons flowing from the outside to the inside of the cell.  One end of MotB is attached to the rigid framework of the cell wall (the peptidoglycan layer) while the opposite end of MotA engages the protein FliG at the surface of the flagellar rotor.  In this project, investigators will test this proposition by fusing a rigid fluorescent probe to the alpha-helical chains of MotA and bleaching it with a short but intense pulse of polarized light.  Subsequent rotation of such markers will be followed by a weaker polarized probe beam.  The effectiveness of this method has already been shown in experiments that demonstrated that the inner and outer components of the flagellar motor rotate as a unit.  The results of this work should provide fundamental understanding of the mechanism of force generation of the stator units that power the flagellar motor.

"Physical characteristics of animals can help determine which ones survive and flourish, especially in a changing environment. These characteristics, also known as functional traits, include features such as length, height, shape, weight, growth rate, sex, and reproductive state. Studying these traits provides insights into how communities of different types of animals come together and how species and communities respond to changes in their environment over time, which is critical for conservation efforts. However, very little information about functional traits is available, and what is available is difficult to combine with other data. How these traits are influenced by environmental changes - such as climate change, pollution, urbanization and human predation - and how they shift over longer timescales are poorly understood, and the need for this information is outstripping the speed with which scientists can collect these data. Digitized collections of animals representing life from the past two million years contain a treasure trove of information about these individuals' functional traits, but these data are stored in multiple places and in different formats. Researchers may have recorded dates differently, for example, or used a variety of terms to describe a single physical feature. Making these data widely available in standardized formats could help scientists study changes in functional traits through time, linking their observations of traits of modern animals to those from fossil and archaeological records. The Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies (FuTRES) project will gather trait data from digitized records; to engage communities of researchers to make these data available, standardized, and useable; and to develop a more complete workflow for using these data in research. 

Functional trait data have revolutionized ecology and are transforming paleontology, but acquiring them requires extensive labor, not only in measuring traits but in managing and communicating the resulting data. When trait data are lacking, researchers substitute average values, or other characteristics like behavioral or dietary categories. These substitutes - assigned at the species level - obscure intraspecific changes in traits. FuTRES fills the clear need for informatics tools that give researchers access to existing trait data and a place to store new data as they are generated. FuTRES is assembling a varied collection of existing trait data, building a pipeline that converts data to an integrated, semantically enriched form, and developing an Application Programming Interface (API) and web platform to serve the data. One of the key innovations of FuTRES is the use of ontologies, an information science approach that creates computer-readable definitions of traits and describes the interrelationships of traits, organisms, collecting events, and other entities. In this way, FuTRES will make functional trait data searchable through reference to time, space, and vertebrate anatomy.  FuTRES will also provide access to trait data via popular data portals (e.g., VertNet) and software such as R, opening the data to scientists in biodiversity and other domains. The toolkit will be tested with mammalian use cases that leverage the massive scale of the unlocked data.  In sum, newly created access mechanisms and tools will provide novel approaches for analyses of trait variation across space and time, providing researchers in disparate fields discovery capabilities for relevant data that would otherwise have been invisible to them.

"The Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) at The Ohio State University stores, amplifies and distributes seeds, plasmid clones and other resources of Arabidopsis thaliana, a key model system for plant research. These have included DNA libraries, cDNA collections, various mutant seed populations and germ plasm from across the globe that represent the immense natural genetic variation of the species. For 30 years, the ABRC has had a global role in facilitating essential and fundamental plant research. ABRC resources have promoted discovery in photosynthesis and all aspects of plant development that have been instrumental in promoting agricultural improvement, green technology, and basic medical research. This award will support the ABRC's core mission to inexpensively distribute DNA and seed resources to the plant biology community, and to support plant science education by providing seeds and teaching resources free-of-charge to K-12 teachers. This project continues the mission of the ABRC to enlarge and expand the collection though acquisition of new resources while at the same time increasing the efficiency of the operation. Substantial outreach and education efforts will allow the ABRC to be a leader in local, national and international outreach and education, providing opportunities to inspire and train future generations of plant scientists.

This project will maintain and increase the current high levels of resource distribution, particularly for seed stocks. The ABRC will maintain quality control testing with an emphasis on stocks that are ordered frequently, stocks in long term storage, and those known to require special storage conditions. The Center will expand the collection through the collaborative inclusion of additional Brassicaceae species, especially Thlaspi arvense (pennycress), a species that has potential oil crop and biodiesel applications. Outreach activities, both local and national, will include the development and solicitation of new education resources and that expands the reach of our successful outreach programming.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the acceleration of the development of innovative industrial design concepts involving complex turbulent fluid flow using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. Although CFD software has broad applications in several industries, the company’s particular interest is in bodies with strong vortical wakes such as bio-inspired renewable energy extraction devices and electric vertical takeoff/landing (eVTOL) vehicles. It is anticipated that the project may lead to the timely and cost-effective design of energy extraction devices without the need to build and test prototypes during the design phase.  The project may also enhance the safety and operating envelope of urban air mobility vehicles. The proposed cloud-based CFD software will provide startups and smaller companies (without access to high-performance computing resources) with the ability to perform CFD analysis in reasonable timeframes. The proposed novel reformulation of the Navier-Stokes equations will also have a lasting impact on the education of the next generation of engineers and scientists as they gain a better understanding of the advantages of the new set of equations for turbulent flows.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a fast high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software for predicting unsteady flow separations over complex geometries at large Reynolds (Re) numbers without any heuristic turbulence modeling. The software  will build upon prior work by the proposer who developed a novel flexion-based Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method for high Re turbulent flows. The LES method uses the flexion (vorticity curl) vector as the primary dependent variable in the Navier-Stokes equations to better track sharp vorticity-gradient regions in high Re flows. The method also uses hyperviscous dissipation instead of a parameterized sub-grid model for unresolved small-scale turbulent motions. The flexion-based LES method will be extended to complex geometries by coupling it with a vortex panel method for the body surface. The vortex panel method leads to accurate predictions of the shear stress on wall boundaries from the wall vorticity without the computationally demanding requirement of a fine mesh to resolve the thin boundary layers that occur in high Re flows. The proposed approach represents a new technique of using panel methods, which have a rich history in aerodynamics, to provide boundary conditions for large eddy simulations of the vortical wake.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a novel system that will increase the safety and productivity of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). GMOs enablie novel live therapeutics, agricultural products, and bio-based consumer products. However, a key challenge is the lack of available tools to easily control the behavior of GMOs. This proposal will develop a technology that can be used to ensure containment of GMOs by tying their survival to the presence of specific control chemicals. The core technology is based on cells that have been engineered to alter their behavior in response to specific chemical signals, and the goal of this project is to expand the portfolio of proteins (and thus behaviors) that can be controlled by chemical inputs. This addresses concern surrounding the use and possible escape of GMOs that may have unknown consequences. 

The proposed project will establish a portfolio of chemically-controlled essential genes. This will be accomplished by protein engineering and simultaneously constructing 12,000 protein libraries spanning 200 different essential genes. Using targeted genome integration, this library of libraries will be integrated into the genome of Escherichia coli. Phenotypic characterization of the library using positive and negative (chemical) selections followed by next-generation DNA sequencing will be used to uncover the function (lethal, viable, or conditional) of individual protein designs. This dataset will illuminate the relationship between structure, sequence, and function for design of chemically-controlled proteins.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I proposal is in the development of a new carbon utilization technology with the ability to make high-value, essential products from carbon dioxide (CO2) like cellulosic textiles, food, and building materials. Enzymatic carbon utilization is of high interest due to its ability to make high-value natural products from carbon dioxide. The impediment to enzymatic carbon utilization technology has been the short longevity of both enzymes and input molecules under cell-free industrial conditions. This project will yield a novel enzyme stabilization approach for carbon fixation and synthesis enzymes. The resulting system may unlock CO2 as a new, natural resource for essential product supply chains that are carbon-negative and water- and land-neutral, unlocking a $10 trillion global market. This scalable technology could create a new carbon industry and advance manufacturing jobs in the United States. This technology could enable sustainable and domestic production of America’s most essential materials from waste carbon dioxide emissions at a cheaper cost than today’s production.

This project involves a production method that applies a bio-inspired, non-covalent enzyme stabilization strategy that employs cell-free conversion of carbon emissions into cellulosic fibers for textiles in a CO2-to-textile process over industrially relevant time periods. The proposed stabilization method preserves enzyme conformation without harming baseline activity to allow for enzymatic activity in non-natural environments. The heteropolymers are synthesized using a standard reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization approach to produce disordered polymeric chains with diverse monomers of varying charges and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity characteristics to complement and stabilize enzymes surfaces. The disordered nature of the polymers enables local surface binding to stabilize the enzyme, maintaining its conformation and protecting against denaturing or degradation. The project scope covers key technical hurdles: (1) the development of a enzyme stabilization technique for carbon fixation and synthesis enzymes, (2) the development of a carbon conversion system and process in a non-natural, industrial environment, and (3) confirmation of a full proof-of-concept solution that can be scalable from mL to 50L scale. If successful, the result is an effective enzyme stabilization method that can fix carbon emissions under cell-free conditions for use in industrial supply chains.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of biodegradable plastics from waste resources to replace petroleum-based plastics in packaging.  Continually increasing demand for plastic packaging, coupled with the inevitable escape of plastic waste into the environment, is posing a monumental pollution issue for the world. Entities within the consumer goods value chain have a pressing need to address these issues, manifested in the form of changing customer demands and legislative pressures. Unfortunately, recycling is not a feasible global solution. Also, most currently available bioplastic alternatives are not considered viable due to issues of cost, sustainability, functionality, and/or biodegradability. The successful development and commercialization of novel biodegradable plastics for packaging may not only address an environmental need for sustainability, but also may create a stronger packaging economy driven by technologies that address both commercial and environmental problems.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) copolymers produced from waste resources. Implementation of PHAs has long been hindered by lack of versatility in the material, as well as production technologies based on using food crops. Upcycling abundant waste streams into novel PHA copolymers and blends may overcome these hindrances and address the technical challenges required for PHAs to replace petroleum-based plastics in packaging. Basing production of PHAs on waste resources may significantly reduce the cost and improve the sustainability of production. Currently, commercialized PHA technologies are limited to incorporating only a handful of different PHA monomers, such as the 4-carbon polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and the medium chain length (MCL) 6-carbon PHA polyhydroxyhexanoate (PHHx). Important properties for industrial application of bioplastics, such as the melting temperature, crystallization kinetics, elasticity, and Young’s modulus, may be improved by incorporation of different monomer units into the biopolymer product. Research and development into this proposed technology has demonstrated feasible production of a whole family of PHB-co-MCL copolymers and blends, incorporating all monomer units from 4 to 14 carbons. This may allow for production of a diverse array of fully biodegradable bio-based packaging materials.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to broaden access to healthcare data. Users of the system developed in this project can take biometric measurements such as heart rate, muscle-activity, and body mass calculations in real-time, with data collected through sensors embedded into clothing.  The innovation enables vital measurements to be taken, both inside and outside of clinical environments, while reducing instrumentation weight and cost requirements. This fabric-based technology can potentially serve users ranging from medical professionals to everyday consumers who will more easily adopt wearable soft-material products in lieu of traditional hardware devices. Specialized sectors such as physical therapy, pre-surgical studies, sports labs, and out-patient care have the highest growth opportunity for new technology adoption. Complementing the rapid growth of telehealth, bio-sensing capabilities for real-time and remote tracking will improve patient compliance and aid health care workers by providing better access to comprehensive vital measurement data.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves material science research in conductive threads and fabrics. These soft goods can bend, stretch, and compress along the body where they are worn. In addition, their electromechanical characteristics allow them to pick up small voltage and current signals that are naturally generated from the body, specifically from the heart, muscles, and the brain. By strategically weaving these materials within a shirt, small voltages for EKG (heart), EMG (muscle), EEG (brain), and BIA (water and body mass content) can be simultaneously captured and measured for heart rate, muscle activity, brain activity, and water and fat content measurements. The technical research will involve innovation in fabric-materials optimized for small signal and low noise pickup and design of a comfortable garment incorporating multiple fabric-based electrodes for simultaneous pickup of EKG/EMG/BIA signals. The project will also develop new signal processing algorithms to transform raw voltages to real-time signals transmitted wirelessly. The desired technical result is a functional and wearable prototype with end-to-end communication from the fabric through the garment to a receiving mobile or desktop app visualizing the processed data for heart rate, muscle activity, and body mass analysis.

"The goal of this project is to develop computer software that allows scientists to compare the genomes of natural populations of organisms. Population genomics (the study of diversity in the genomic DNA of populations instead of individuals) has important applications in agriculture, anthropology, conservation, medicine, and several other fields of biology. Recent technology advances have greatly lowered the cost of DNA sequencing so large amounts of data are available. At the same time statisticians have developed new methods for analyzing large collections of genome-sized data. Combining the data with the new analysis approaches can let scientists answer fundamental questions about the biology of species that have never before been accessible. However, most population genomics studies fail to take advantage of the latest population genomics statistical methods. This is because the genomic data requires a lot of processing to prepare it for the analysis steps, and these operations are not easy to learn. Lack of bioinformatics knowledge has led to erroneous conclusions, irreproducible results, incomplete analyses, and slow turnaround time of population genomics projects. This project aims to provide software that can handle those tasks in a consistent and correct way and allow direct access to the statistical tools, to bring about new insights in population biology. 

This project will address the largest impediments to model-based population genomics by building a user-friendly and intuitive pipeline platform, the ""Pop-gen Pipeline Platform"" (PPP). This platform will help researchers avoid the problems inherent in re-inventing data processing scripts to feed data into their population genomics analyses, and considerably reduce time and effort. PPP will include tested scripts and pipelines for data preparation, and in addition the tools needed to build evolutionary models, carry out analyses of data, and create visualization of results via the Ruffus Computation Pipeline Library in Python. PPP will also be developed as a stand-alone application with a graphical user interface (GUI) under the popular and robust Galaxy Project (www.galaxyproject.org) for bioinformatics analyses. An online server deploying Galaxy/PPP will be developed and maintained at Temple University, Philadelphia (www.dev3.cst.temple.edu) for users to interactively submit jobs on a first-come-first-served basis. Online forums will be established for support, and to collect suggestions regarding what is desired for further development under PPP. Tutorials and videos about example applications of the PPP will be added to the Galaxy Project Wikipedia training channels. Additionally, a significant part of this work will involve educating Temple University seniors, Philadelphia area high school teachers, and their students about the power of bioinformatics in modern biology through summer workshops.

"The nitrogen (N)-cycle as it relates to the bio-, atmo-, and hydro-spheres have been well studied due to N’s abundance in Earth’s atmosphere and importance for life. In the less understood solid Earth N cycle, plate tectonics has regulated N fluxes between surface and deep Earth reservoirs over much of Earth’s history, affecting the bulk Earth N distribution over millennial timescales. Thus, the mass balance of nitrogen (N) delivered to the deep Earth during subduction and then returned to the surface during volcanism and degassing is critically important, yet efficiency estimates are highly variable. Current estimates suggest that 45-74% of subducted N does not return to the surface through arc volcanism. This implies that N is being sequestered in the deep Earth in variable amounts, which could reflect factors such as subducting plate composition or subduction conditions. Candidates for deep, poorly characterized N reservoirs include mid-lower continental crust, subcontinental mantle, fore-arc to sub-arc mantle, or deeper mantle (i.e., deeper upper mantle, transition zone or lower mantle). This highlights a need for N measurements on appropriate samples as well as thorough constraints on N behavior in these reservoirs. New key constraints on nitrogen (N) distribution and processing within the fore-arc to sub-arc regions of subduction zones will be provided. First, some of the first N composition measurements of sediment-rich and serpentinite-rich mélange matrix rocks and minerals to characterize the distribution of N during fore-arc processing will be made. Second, phase equilibria experiments to assess the stability of key N hosting minerals and measure N melt/fluid-mineral partition coefficients on mélange-matrix materials as a function of several factors (pressure, temperature, oxygen fugacity, chlorine content, and partial melt composition) to track N behavior during dehydration and partial melting in the slab at sub-arc depths will be performed. Data from the proposed study along with those from previous studies will be used to quantify the amount of N that is delivered from the fore-arc to the sub-arc processing zone, in which minerals it is hosted, and how it varies by dominant lithology (sediment or serpentinite). How much N is released from the slab during sub-arc processing versus how much is sequestered in the sub-arc mantle in subduction zones of different thermal states will then be quantified. These will constitute novel constraints on N behavior that can be applied to subduction regimes throughout Earth’s history. Hence, it will also be used to address the feedback and evolution of N across the coupled solid Earth-atmosphere systems. This proposal supports two early career female PIs, two graduate students, and two+ undergraduates from University of Arizona (UA) and University of Southern California (USC). To enhance collaboration and broaden participation, the PIs will offer a joint virtual graduate seminar on deep volatile cycling including students at UA and USC. The team at UA will develop a museum display at UA’s Alfie Norville Gem & Mineral Museum on high pressure-high temperature geoscience research (including laboratory equipment and research applications).

As the most abundant constituent of the Earth’s atmosphere and as an essential ingredient of life, the behavior of nitrogen (N) in the present-day atmosphere, oceans, crust and biosphere (collectively known as the surficial reservoirs) have been relatively well-studied. However, the N composition of the Earth’s surficial reservoirs may not have remained the same throughout Earth’s history and this may have implications for early Earth climate and evolution of life. Nitrogen is exchanged between the Earth’s surficial reservoirs and the deep interior via plate tectonics, especially subduction zones. In subduction zones, N in the Earth’s crust (along with components from the atmosphere, ocean and biosphere) is pulled into the mantle or the interior of the Earth. Some proportion of the N from the mantle escapes back into the atmosphere and ocean by volcanic degassing. This N exchange between the surface and interior is not well-constrained and this proposed study aims to fulfil a key component of this knowledge gap. The N composition of typical subduction zone rocks will be measured to determine where N is hosted as pressure and temperature increase. Laboratory experiments at conditions in the Earth’s mantle will be performed to understand the behavior of N once the crust enters the mantle and melts. The objective is to eventually use our results to estimate how the N composition of the Earth’s mantle and atmosphere have changed through Earth’s history. This proposal supports two early career female PIs, two graduate students, and two+ undergraduates from University of Arizona (UA) and University of Southern California (USC).

The team at UA will develop a museum display at UA’s Alfie Norville Gem & Mineral Museum on plate tectonics connecting the surface and interior of the Earth, which would be an excellent medium to educate the public on state-of-the-art research.

This IRES project will support US students and provide international education, training and research in marine geochemistry and carbon cycling in a tropical estuary (Douala Estuary) in the Atlantic coast of Cameroon, West Africa. During this study, faculty and students from the University of Delaware, a PhD granting institution and Fort Hays State University, a non-PhD granting institution will partner with faculty and students from the University of Douala and the University of Yaound? 1in Cameroon. Over the next three years, 9 undergraduates and 3 MS students will travel to Cameroon to conduct hands-on, field-based research that is focused on investigating the effects of agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping activities on carbon cycling in the Douala Estuary. The objectives are to (1) document pollution in the water column and sediments and (2) assess if and how the human activities and pollution affect carbon dioxide production in water column and sediments. Data acquired by the students will provide important information to assess the role of the Douala Estuary in carbon cycling and provide valuable information to model the movement of carbon at the local, regional and even global scale.

This IRES project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to conduct faculty mentored, hands-on research in an apprenticeship-type model. Different aspects of the project will form the basis of undergraduate research topics and graduate student theses. A goal of our IRES program is to attract underrepresented minority students and mentor them to develop self-confidence, independent and critical thinking skills necessary to excel in a research and in careers in the geosciences. By interacting with Cameroonian peers, the US students will enrich their cultural experience, build personal and professional networks and establish relationships that will form the core of future international research collaborations. The results of the students' projects will provide scientific input that will be useful for designing sustainable management programs for the use and protection of estuarine resources.

Carbon in estuaries are an integral part of the global carbon cycle. The US Carbon Cycle Research Program identified carbon contributions from estuaries to the atmosphere as a critical area for research. Much research on carbon cycling has been conducted in estuaries in temperate regions. To date, there are no studies of carbon cycling in tropical estuaries of Africa and even less is known about how agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping activities polluting theses estuaries affect the carbon cycle. Few estuarine studies are based in Africa, despite the high human population along the coast and extensive human alteration of estuarine ecosystems. The US Carbon Cycle Research Program identified carbon sources and fluxes to and from estuaries as a critical area for research because estuaries link the terrestrial, ocean and atmospheric carbon reservoirs. Yet, the role in local, regional or even global carbon cycling from tropical estuaries in sub-Saharan Africa which receive far greater amounts of organic carbon and pollutants compared to temperate and high latitude estuaries is unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, for six weeks and over a three-year period, US students and their Cameroonian peers will conduct field based research to elucidate how anthropogenic activities (agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping) that pollute the Douala Estuary with nutrients (e.g., nitrates) and metals (Cadmium) affect carbon cycling in the water column and sediments. The anticipated results of this project will provide important information to assess the role of the Douala Estuary in carbon cycling and provide valuable data for carbon cycling modelling at the local, regional and even global scale. Students will test the hypothesis that anthropogenic pollution in the Douala Estuary increases bio-productivity in the water column and sediments, alters the cycling of carbon and increases the flux of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. 

By interacting with Cameroonian peers, the US students will enrich their cultural experience, build personal and professional networks and establish relationships that will form the core of future international research collaborations. Finally, the results of student projects will provide scientific input that is useful for designing sustainable management programs for the use and protection of estuarine resources.

This project will develop new technological platforms and educational innovations that will unlock our understanding of and ability to control the expression of genes in higher order organisms from yeast and plants to humans, with broad applications in biotechnology. Chromatin is the layer of hundreds of proteins bound on top of the genome. It confers regulatory handles over diverse cellular and organismal processes including aging and cancer, and it could be leveraged in biotechnological applications including bioremediation, environmental sensing, and bio-based production of commodity chemicals. Chromatin also provides a strong topic for pedagogical innovation and enrichment. This project will develop hands-on experiments for middle and high school students that connect molecular changes in chromatin to effects observable by eye, in this case the binding of yeast cells to the surface of an agar plate. Furthermore, the numerical and biochemical diversity of chromatin advocates for new pedagogical approaches at the collegiate and PhD levels. Specifically, this project will develop new coursework modules that train the next generation of scientists in how to handle and analyze large data sets.  American Rescue Plan funding of this project will support the investigator at a critical stage in his career.

Chromatin is incredibly diverse at the molecular level. There are more than 80 different amino acid residues on five histone proteins known to undergo over 20 distinct post-translational modifications. Hundreds of proteins, often containing domains referred to as writers and readers, both regulate and interact with this complex biochemical palette. Through the development of high content technologies paired with biochemical and genetic approaches it has become clear that much of this diversity is functional. However, unlike many methods that can characterize chromatin at high throughput, functional assays remain substantially more limited in scale. In particular, characterizing and engineering the enzymatic activities and specificities of epigenetic writers still rely largely on low throughput biochemical assays that require recombinant protein production and purification that are challenging to scale even with robotic liquid handling. This proposal seeks to build upon recent synthetic biology platforms the investigator and his team have developed using yeast surface display and epigenome editors to unlock access to the diversity of chromatin. With a focus on histone acetyltransferases (HAT), they will establish proof-of-principle demonstrations that these systems can 1) map the residue specificities of all known human HATs; 2) connect sequence to function by accessing the very large enzyme and substrate sequence space by directed evolution approaches; and 3) probe the impact of molecular context on function. While the investigations focus on HATs, the investigator and his team seek to motivate the future expansion and application of this experimental platform to the diverse biochemistry of chromatin.

This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project will focus on elucidating the mechanisms that lead to improved strength in fast pyrolysis biochar concrete. Biochar is a carbon-rich material made from the pyrolysis of biomass. Biochar is produced via the thermal decomposition of biomass in a zero or limited oxygen environment. Since biochar is highly stable, the embedded carbon is resistant to decomposition, slowly releasing CO2 over hundreds or thousands of years. This results in long-term removal of carbon from the atmosphere, making biochar a powerful material for carbon sequestration. Fast pyrolysis of biomass generates also a bio-oil and synthetic natural gas, which can generate energy and decrease the use of fossil fuels. Recently, biochar has gained momentum as a carbon sequestering agent for use in concrete. However, this application has only utilized slow pyrolysis biochar, which has much different properties than the fast pyrolysis biochar adopted in this project. By using fast pyrolysis biochar, a preliminary study shows that when 15 percent of cement weight is replaced with biochar, the strength of concrete increases by nearly 40 percent. At 15 percent biochar to cement substitution, the biochar can offset the greenhouse gas emissions associated with concrete by at least 48 percent; at 32 percent biochar to cement substitution, the biochar would make concrete a carbon negative building material. 

To accomplish this goal, three primary objectives are identified: 1) to characterize the microstructural and physiochemical properties of three distinct fast pyrolysis biochar products; 2) to characterize the microstructure and chemical composition of cementitious materials made with these three biochar products; and 3) to analyze the strength behavior of the resulting concretes and the strength-microstructure relationship. Furthermore, this award contributes to the education of a female graduate student, and will provide research opportunities for middle school girls with events designed to address the reported gap between STEM interest/aptitude in adolescent girls and girls’ chosen career paths at later ages.

"This grant supports research to pursue a fundamental understanding of adsorption-deformation coupling in soft nanoporous materials.  The research will develop corresponding mechanical theories, aiming to better predict hygroscopic movements in complex nanoporous media and control sorption-induced actuation by design where sorption refers to the binding of ions to charged surfaces. Soft nanoporous materials having characteristic pore sizes below 100 nm are ubiquitous in nature (e.g., cellulose, protein) and in engineering applications (e.g., cement, gel, nanocomposites). These materials often exhibit significant swelling/shrinkage upon adsorption/desorption of fluids/gases due to nanoconfinement effects resulting from their network topology and interfacial interactions. Nature uses such stimuli-responsive features of cellulose nanofibers to facilitate the dispersal of plant seeds upon humidity change. Bio-inspired soft nanoporous materials have been recently developed for fast and reliable actuators, sensors, and artificial muscles driven by sorption of solvent molecules. This project will establish and validate a multiscale mechanics framework informed by pore-scale thermodynamics and molecular simulations for predicting the sorption-induced straining of nanoporous materials. The project will also pursue an educational initiative involving new course development on multiscale poromechanics and pre-college outreach by harnessing the excitement surrounding nano-engineered materials and leveraging it with the exceptional infrastructure for innovation and education at the participating institutes. 

This research is driven by the hypothesis that the complex coupling between sorption and deformation in nanoporous media can be predicted by focusing on two key pore-scale attributions, namely the disjoining pressure and surface tension induced by solid-adsorbate interactions. To test this hypothesis, the study will first establish a continuum theory guided by the thermodynamics of mixtures, i.e., by viewing material as a superposition of the solid, fluid and surface phases, through which the smeared pore-scale forces appear as macroscale adsorption stresses acting on the porous skeleton. Expressions of pore-scale forces will be then sought via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and surrogate pore models. Specifically, simplified pore models will be developed based on Gibbs’ excess treatment of nanoconfined fluid films to link pore-scale forces induced by sorption with experimentally measurable quantities (i.e., adsorption isotherm). The pore model will be validated by MD simulations of nanopores subjected to fluid adsorption. These microscale forces will then be upscaled via statistical homogenization to complete the poromechanics framework. Finally, the theory will be applied to model the sorption-deformation behavior of amorphous cellulose interacting with water vapor. The prediction will be validated against experimental data and MD simulation results obtained from the same material system. The research will challenge the current paradigm of poromechanics where short-range interactions and surface forces within individual pores have been routinely neglected. If successful, the research will greatly expand our fundamental understanding on mechanics of active and soft porous materials.

"This grant will focus on gaining a fundamental understanding of embedded fiber networks and creating the tools necessary to characterize their behavior from limited available measurements. Embedded fiber networks are ubiquitous in nature, from the extracellular matrix surrounding biological cells, to branching blood vessels embedded in organs, to moth’s cocoons. Understanding these systems is important because these systems are the fundamental mechanical building blocks of many types of natural and engineered biological tissue, and bio-inspired advanced materials. It is important not only to understand these systems, but also to be able to measure their mechanical behavior in a non-destructive manner so that advances in understanding can be applied in the real world. This research project will synthesize experiments, theory-based computational models, and data-driven computational models to elucidate the fundamental relationship between embedding matrix properties, fiber properties, and fiber network properties for soft embedded fiber networks undergoing large deformation. In addition, this research project will develop computational capabilities for the analysis of these systems where severely limited image-based data is used to predict both structural properties and characterize mechanical behavior. The research will be complemented by disseminating relevant data and code under open source licenses, and releasing online modules focused on applying machine learning to mechanics research. The research will also be complemented by establishing educational outreach programs at the middle school and high school levels that focus on bringing STEM education to underserved populations.   

The specific goal of this research is to define fundamental structure-function relationships in soft embedded fiber networks undergoing large deformation and create the tools needed to analyze these systems given limited available imaging data. Critically, it is necessary to develop tools to evaluate these systems non-destructively because one of their most important applications is in living systems. Thus, the research objectives of this project include: (i) curating an experimental dataset and implementing and validating a computational model of three-dimensional embedded fiber networks undergoing large deformation; (ii) understanding and delineating the different mechanical regimes of embedded fiber networks undergoing large deformation; (iii) establishing and testing a machine learning framework to rapidly and non-destructively analyze embedded fiber networks from imperfectly-paired images taken on the discrete fiber scale.

Part I: Non-technical Summary
The Antarctic Peninsula is one of the most rapidly warming regions on the planet. This 5-yr time-series program will build on an ongoing international collaboration with scientists from the Chilean Antarctic Program to evaluate the role of temperature, light absorbing particles, snow-algae growth, and their radiative forcing effects on snow and ice melt in the Western Antarctic Peninsula. There is strong evidence that these effects may be intensifying due to a warming climate. Rising temperatures can increase the growth rate of coastal snow algae as well as enhance the input of particles from sources such as the long-range transport of black carbon to the Antarctic continent from intensifying Southern Hemisphere wildfire seasons. Particle and algae feedbacks can have immediate local impacts on snow melt and long-term regional impacts on climate because reduced snow cover alters how the Antarctic continent interacts with the rest of the global climate. A variety of ground-based and remote sensing data collected across multiple spatial scales will be used. Ground measurements will be compared to satellite imagery to develop novel computer algorithms to map ice algal bloom effects under changing climates. The project is expected to fundamentally advance knowledge of the spatial and temporal snow algae growing season, which is needed to quantify impacts on regional snow and ice melt. The program also has a strong partnership with the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators to involve cruise passengers as citizen scientists for sample collection. Antarctic research results will be integrated into undergraduate curricula and research opportunities through studies to LAPs and snow algae in the Pacific Northwest. The PI will recruit and train a diverse pool of students in cryosphere climate related research methods on Mt. Baker in Western Washington. Trained undergraduate will then serve as instructors for a local Snow School that takes middle school students to Mt. Baker to learn about snow science. Resulting datasets from Antarctica and Mt. Baker will be used in University classes to explore regional effects of climate change. Along with enhancing cryosphere-oriented place-based undergraduate field courses in the Pacific Northwest, the PI will recruit and train a diverse pool of undergraduate students to serve as instructors for the Mt. Baker Snow School program. This award will advance our understanding of cryosphere-climate feedbacks, which are likely changing and will continue to evolve in a warming world, while also increasing under-represented student engagement in the polar geosciences. 

Part 2: Technical Summary 
Rapid and persistent climate warming in the Western Antarctic Peninsula is likely resulting in intensified snow-algae growth and an extended bloom season in coastal areas. Similarly, deposition of light absorbing particles (LAPs) onto Antarctica cryosphere surfaces, such as black carbon from intensifying Southern Hemisphere wildfire seasons, and dust from the expansion of ice-free regions in the Antarctic Peninsula, may be increasing. The presence of snow algae blooms and LAPs enhance the absorption of solar radiation by snow and ice surfaces. This positive feedback creates a measurable radiative forcing, which can have immediate local and long-term regional impacts on albedo, snow melt and downstream ecosystems. This project will investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of snow algae, black carbon and dust across the Western Antarctica Peninsula region, their response to climate warming, and their role in regional snow and ice melt. Data will be collected across multiple spatial scales from in situ field measurements and sample collection to imagery from ground-based photos and high resolution multi-spectral satellite sensors. Ground measurements will inform development and application of novel algorithms to map algal bloom extent through time using 0.5-3m spatial resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery. Results will be used to improve snow algae parameterization in a new version of the Snow Ice Aerosol Radiation model (SNICARv3) that includes bio-albedo feedbacks, eventually informing models of ice-free area expansion through incorporation of SNICARv3 in the Community Earth System Model. Citizen scientists will be mentored and engaged in the research through an active partnership with the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators that frequently visits the region. The cruise ship association will facilitate sampling to develop a unique snow algae observing network to validate remote sensing algorithms that map snow algae with high-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery from space. These time-series will inform instantaneous and interannual radiative forcing calculations to assess impacts of snow algae and LAPs on regional snow melt. Quantifying the spatio-temporal growing season of snow algae and impacts from black carbon and dust will increase our ability to model their impact on snow melt, regional climate warming and ice-free expansion in the Antarctic Peninsula region.

"A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's Indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This Targeted STEM Infusion Project (TSIP) aligns directly with that goal, and moreover seeks to increase research activities and opportunities for students to conduct research at several tribal colleges. The project aims to strengthen existing relationships among STEM faculty at the participating institutions (Aaniiih Nakoda College (ANC), Little Big Horn College (LBHC), Stone Child College (SCC), and Montana State University (MSU)) and build new course-based research experiences for American Indian students. 

The project aims to increase participation of American Indian students in STEM research and increase research capacity at tribal colleges in Montana. The project supports the expansion of locally relevant CUREs at ANC and LBHC while initiating course-based research experiences (CUREs) at two additional tribal colleges. MSU faculty will provide training on implementing an existing co-developed CURE module, using zebrafish as an environmental indicator species, and support tribal college faculty in designing novel CUREs based on research conducted at tribal colleges. CUREs are integrated into the curriculum at each institution, reaching a range of students who have not been exposed to research opportunities. Students will develop independent hypotheses to test within the larger CURE theme. Participating faculty will learn research techniques and receive training on instrumentation and curriculum. Research findings will be shared through community exhibitions and presentations at national conferences.

"Approximately one quarter of carbon emissions each year is taken up by the worlds’ oceans, which play a critical role in the global carbon cycle. As the oceans continue to respond to climate change, it is important to understand the carbon cycle and how it will change as well. In the surface waters of the ocean, phytoplankton take up carbon through photosynthesis, and a small fraction of this material then sinks to the deeper ocean in a process referred to as the “biological pump.” Current estimates of the global biological pump are similar in size to the amount of global carbon emissions, but uncertainties in these estimates are very large. This project will focus on understanding the role that marine phytoplankton in the North Atlantic Ocean play in the carbon cycle. The project will employ coordinated use of state-of-the-art, remote observational tools, namely biogeochemical profiling floats and ocean color observations from satellites. New techniques will be developed to maximize the information that can be glean from these observations and constrain biological carbon fluxes out of the sunlit upper ocean and through its deeper interior layers over basin-wide, seasonal, and annual scales. Finally, the performance of existing, satellite-based models of these biological fluxes will be evaluated in comparison with analogous estimates made from biogeochemical profiling float data, which can help to fill in satellite observing gaps below the surface and during periods of heavy cloud cover. The proposed effort will provide training and mentorship to a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher. Outreach will be conducted through the 2021 Education And Research: Testing Hypotheses (EARTH) Workshop: A successful, ~15-year collaborative effort between MBARI and the Monterey Bay Aquarium to assist educators with incorporating ocean science information and real-time data into the classroom. To enhance diversity and inclusion in ocean science, a first-generation college student will be selected to participate in the 2021 MBARI Summer Intern Program. 

Persistent and spatially-distributed in situ observations are needed to develop, and continuously train, more accurate models and remote-sensing algorithms to reduce the uncertainty (currently >100%) in estimates of the biological pump magnitude. The goals of the proposed effort are to develop, implement, and compare robust methods for quantifying biological carbon sequestration by leveraging the complementary information provided by bio-optical and chemical sensors on profiling floats deployed in the North Atlantic Ocean. This project will dovetail with several larger observational programs (EXPORTS, PACE, and pending Global Biogeochemical Argo) and leverage committed NOAA and NASA funding to deploy four biogeochemical profiling floats. Results from the analysis of float data will also be compared with estimates derived from satellite observations to assess the influences of 1) subpolar spring bloom timing and magnitude; and 2) more efficient subtropical carbon export processes, on the amount of carbon annually sequestered by the biological pump. Evaluating carbon production, recycling, and export from different perspectives (e.g., chemical, optical, and remote sensing), will capitalize on the strengths of different sensors and platforms using a combination of standard and novel methods. Quality-control of the data from ~300 existing and four newly deployed profiling floats in the North Atlantic will result in a valuable resource for other investigators. Data handling and processing tools developed during this project will be made publicly available to reduce barriers to entry for other scientists and students interested in analyzing large volumes of BGC float and ocean color data.

With National Science Foundation support, California State University Los Angeles (Cal State LA) establishes the Center for Advancement toward Sustainable Urban Systems (CATSUS).  Its goals are to: (1) advance novel and transformative research focused on issues related to the generation, supply, consumption, protection and revitalization of energy and water systems within the framework of urban environments, (2) increase the research capacity of Cal State LA, and (3) develop highly-effective undergraduate and graduate level research education curriculum, training and opportunities in STEM fields for underrepresented minority groups at Cal State LA.  Research interests in sustainable urban systems stem from the fact that energy consumption in urban areas is responsible for 70% of greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition, although urban areas cover only 3-4% of the planet’s surface area, they affect 41% of watersheds globally.  CATSUS will integrate research findings into undergraduate and Master’s level engineering education, K-12 and community college outreach, and policy-informing components, while creating pathways towards doctorate and postdoctoral research programs.  

Three research thrusts aim to advance knowledge in the areas of physics, chemistry, engineering, materials science, experimental techniques, and modeling methodologies.  Research outcomes from the thrust areas will be transformative, addressing both fundamental and applied questions relating to sustainability of urban energy and water resources.  The thrust area of Energy Systems and Management in Buildings will (1) develop new thermal management strategies in buildings and photovoltaic devices, and (2) advance knowledge regarding urban bio-derived fuels and grid-scale energy storage systems.  The second thrust area, Advanced Materials for Energy and Water Applications, will develop/design new materials for (1) highly efficient photovoltaics, and (2) water treatment including wastewater remediation and seawater desalination.  The third thrust area, Resilience of Urban Water Bodies, will develop (1) novel and effective water resource and sediment management strategies, and (2) novel experimental approaches to ascertain the long-term impacts of wildfires and microplastics on urban watershed water storage and quality.

In Phase II, the Center will use an interdisciplinary approach cutting across scientific and engineering methodologies to:

•pursue a fundamental understanding of the adaptive and responsive functioning of multi-scale biomolecular and cellular assemblies that enable control of function in vivo; 
•use these fundamental principles for designing and developing novel bio-inspired functioning machines ranging from designer nanodevices, cells and tissue to diagnostic and therapeutic devices; and
•refine, augment, and institutionalize CCBM’s signature integrated, interdisciplinary graduate training program that combines scientific and professional skills with supervision of research and training experiences for undergraduate and high school students aimed at enhancing and developing career opportunities for underrepresented minorities in STEM fields.

By integrating research and education, the Center aims to develop a robust pipeline for underrepresented minorities in the STEM workforce at all levels and produce graduates in both physical and biological sciences and can pursue cross-disciplinary STEM careers in academia, laboratories or industry.

Three thrusts are presented and defined according to their scale (nano, meso, and multicellular).  Thrust 1:  Protein Metamorphosis and Responsive Nanodevices.  Phase II research focuses on the emerging theme of protein metamorphosis as mechanism to enable natural and synthetic controllable biological nanodevices, organized in two broad areas: the functional roles of gradually morphing proteins; and engineering of control systems of the assembly-disassembly of biological macromolecular assemblies.  Thrust 2: Adaptive and Responsive Mesoscale Assemblies.  In Phase II, the focus is to understand the mechanisms that enable assemblies to function collectively in adaptive and responsive ways as well as exploiting them for applications.

This project is jointly funded by Major Research Instrumentation Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).  Funding will support acquisition of an ion chromatograph which allows the determination and quantification of important molecules in natural waters.  The IC would directly benefit ten ongoing projects in geochemistry, chemistry, mine-waste remediation, botany, and environmental science and engineering.   Intended studies of Arsenic and metal remediation at a local Superfund site has implications for public health and environmental recovery.  Planned engagement with a local watershed education Program would expose hundreds of K-12 teachers and their students to geochemical analysis applications to local mining related environmental issues. The instrument will support the research of early career and female geoscientists and research and teaching training at two primarily undergraduate institutions in rural Montana where first generation and Native American students make up a significant part of the student body.

The IC will support analysis of major cations, anions and organic acids in aqueous samples.  A particular focus of the PIs research agenda are investigations aimed at understanding how arsenic and metal contaminants cycle in the environment, study of bio-electrochemical methods to reduce nitrates from agricultural runoff, ecosystems remediation, and exploring extremophile mediated biogeochemical interactions in Yellowstone's hot springs.

"Deployable pin-jointed (DPJ) structures, due to their being lightweight, foldable, and having high stiffness, have shown high research and development interest in state-of-the-art applications in many fields, such as aerospace and mechanical engineering, civil engineering, robotics and bio-medical materials. A DPJ structure is composed of members in compression (usually bars or struts) and tension (usually cables or tendons), connected by pin joints. In operation, these DPJ structures have various performance requirements, such as maintaining a high level of surface accuracy, and achieving desired stiffness and tunable natural frequencies. Loss of desired performance often yields malfunction or even breakdown of a DPJ structure. However, optimal design of DPJ structures with the desired performance is hard to obtain, due to issues related to constitutive modeling and lack of design tools. This project addresses these problems by creating a data-driven closed-loop platform for optimal design of DPJ structures. A series of data-driven tools, that create the proposed closed-loop platform, will be designed and built: (1) a novel stochastic method for determining an initial equilibrium configuration of a DJP structure will be created; and, (2) a new computational modeling technique for DPJ structures, based on machine learning and advanced nondestructive testing,  will be developed. The project will address an urgent need in structural engineering, and provide a deeper understanding of the design and computational modeling of DPJ structures. The results obtained from this project can help enhance the performance, safety and longevity of a class of structures in various areas, including architectures, spacecraft, military equipment and high-tech devices. The project will complement efforts to build the next-generation advanced cyberinfrastructure ecosystem by developing a series of data-driven tools to facilitate numerical and high-performance scientific computing, and expand modeling and simulation capabilities for mechanics of solid and structures. The project will also help upgrade the curriculum on computational modeling of structures. Engineering students will be recruited and mentored in this project. The training for students will include structural design, computational modeling, algorithm development and experimental testing.

Traditional structural design is an open-loop protocol, in which a design-modeling-validation procedure is followed. The main objective of this project is to create a data-driven closed-loop platform for optimal design of DPJ structures. This frame-invariant platform is new in providing a closed-loop structural design protocol. In this platform, experimental results will not only be used for model validation, but also in turn serve to provide training and testing data to further improve performance of a data-driven computational model. The loop will then be closed by using the computational model to guide initial structural design.  Toward this goal, two tasks will be carried out. The first task is to develop a stochastic approach to form finding. Traditional methods for form finding of DPJ structures require member grouping, which  relies highly on the geometric simplicity of the structure. To resolve this issue, a new method, called the stochastic fixed nodal position method, will be designed and investigated. The key benefit of this method is that it does not use member grouping or require any geometric simplicity. These features will allow the method to serve as a powerful tool in design of large-scale, complex, and irregular DPJ structures. The second task is to develop a data-driven computational modeling technique. Constitutive modeling techniques often over-simplify a DPJ structure, which results in the failure to reflect important mechanical properties of the structure. Very few recently developed techniques for computational modeling are suitable to DPJ structures, due to their special characteristics that are not commonly seen in other solids or structures. This project will develop a novel computational modeling technique based on machine learning and non-destructive testing for DPJ structures. This technique will bypass traditional constitutive modeling and provide good performance in handling DPJ structures.

"Engagement of Indigenous communities by scientific researchers is riddled with examples of scientific misconduct and a lack of direct benefit to participants and their communities. The Summer internship for INdigenous peoples in Genomics (SING) short course offers training and tools for early career Indigenous scientists to engage in the research process and community members to guide their communities in making informed decisions about research. Alumni of SING and affiliated faculty have organized through the workshop to present ethical concerns around current frameworks of scientific engagement to the general scientific community and to raise the collective voice of Indigenous people in genomics research. However, the impact of SING in its mission to inform participants in genomics research in Indigenous communities and build out networks of collaborating Indigenous researchers have not been explicitly tested. This study defines the role and impact of SING in shaping views of research and incorporating
Indigenous researchers into scholarly networks among Indigenous alumni and faculty. Long-term assessment of training programs such as SING have not been investigated to any great extent such that this can serve as a model for determining the effectiveness of short course scientific training programs.

Recognizing that genomic research is inherent in future medical, scientific, and translational research, the inclusion and involvement of Indigenous people is important and the role of SING to facilitate this engagement is unparalleled. In this project, the investigators objectively measure the impact of the SING program by eliciting the perceptions and understandings of genome science and ethics engagement of past SING participants and faculty through focus groups surveys, and social network analysis. Specifically, the project engages SING alumni and participants by 1) elucidating Indigenous perspectives on genetic research and scholarship, 2) defining interactions and influences initiated by SING among Indigenous genomics scholars, and 3) developing and delivering topic specific training for the general public and SING alumni. Findings from this work will inform in-person training for the SING program and engagement of the general scientific community to impact research approaches, scholarship, and public policy.

"Human life plays out in the vast landscape of our social networks. Successful social navigation can help buffer against loneliness and negative interactions, but it requires learning who is connected to whom: the latent structure underlying social relationships (e.g., cliques or hubs). The goal of this project, led by a team of researchers at Brown University, is to reveal the behavioral and neural signatures of how people learn and reason about real-world social networks. Despite the importance of understanding how people learn relational social knowledge, much remains unknown about how the brain organizes this knowledge. Spatial cognition research offers a window into this problem: A long line of animal research has demonstrated that the brain represents information about physical space in a ‘cognitive map’ that binds information about entities in the world and their relationships. Cognitive maps have been shown to speed learning in new or changing environments. This project tests whether, in mentally navigating their social networks, people recruit cognitive map-like representations similar to those used to navigate external physical space. By integrating advanced human imaging methods, computational modeling, social network science, and longitudinal sampling, the investigators will study a large cohort of first-year undergraduate students as they develop new friendships over the course of an academic year to investigate the behavioral and neural signatures of emerging knowledge about real-world social networks. The investigators will identify the neural representations of social information in this complex and dynamic environment. The results of these studies have the potential to transform our knowledge of how humans learn about and navigate through their social world. It has implications for advancing our understanding of social factors that contribute to the persistence of undergraduates in STEM fields. This project is funded by Integrative Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems (NCS), a multidisciplinary program jointly supported by the Directorates for Biology (BIO), Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE). 

This work aims to provide a foundation for understanding human learning in real social contexts. An incoming undergraduate class (comprised of individuals who have yet to establish their college social network) provides a unique testbed to track the emergence of a social network and its shifting configuration over the course of the students’ first academic year. The main hypothesis is that an individual’s cognitive map of their social network enables them to navigate more adeptly through their network. The study will probe neural representations of this cognitive structure by means of function magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) focusing on the hippocampus and orbitofrontal/entorhinal cortex). Different classes of computational models (i.e., state transition-based, successor representation-based, and latent-cause based) will be built to test competing accounts of social network learning and the format of social cognitive maps. These models will probe for person-level parameters to assess whether individual variability biases this learning process, including whether an individual’s position in their community, and thus their capacity to gather information, shapes their ability to build cognitive maps of their social environment. By harnessing both a cross-sectional and longitudinal design, the research will provide an organizing framework that can identify how the brain represents social knowledge about complex environments while precisely modelling how cognitive maps of a social network enable efficient social navigation. This work will provide a window into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the social learning processes that unfold in the real world.

"Humans are not, by nature, logical creatures. It takes focus to maintain our composure and not let emotions color our judgement. When we can control our emotional state, we can get “in the zone” and perform well. Failing to do so, we’ll “have a bad day”, or just be “off”. Why does this happen? And, in terms of neurobiological mechanisms, how does this happen? Our emotions are regulated by internal states, such as arousal, attention, and motivation, brain-wide modulatory processes that impact neural function related to perception, decision making, and action. What are the neural mechanisms of those interactions? This project will explore the interactions between internal states and cognitive processing in the cerebral cortex. The investigators will leverage their expertise in “brain training” by giving subjects visual feedback about their neural activity so that they are directly aware of their internal states. In this way, they will study whether subjects are able to better regulate their internal states so that they are able to make perceptual judgments and perform motor skills more consistently at a high level of performance. The investigators will also organize workshops to bring together experts in areas related to this project, train researchers to become well-versed in experimental and computational neuroscience, and enhance the participation of undergraduates, women, and underrepresented minorities in the research.  

This project involves three integrated research threads. First, the investigators will use multi-electrode recordings in several regions of the cerebral cortex simultaneously to identify brain-wide signatures of internal states and their effect on the communication between cortical areas. Second, they will train subjects to volitionally control their internal states using neurofeedback. Third, they will examine whether subjects can harness their internal states to accelerate learning and improve performance on challenging perceptual and motor tasks. In these studies, they will focus on three types of internal states -- one that guides us in the spatial world around us (spatial attention), one that manages our alertness throughout the day (arousal), and one that aids our effort in focusing on what lies ahead (motivation). They will study how these internal states interact and to what extent they can be volitionally controlled in three areas across the brain: visual area V4, prefrontal cortex, and motor cortex. Together, their work will provide i) a unified account of the impact of multiple internal states on brain-wide neural computations spanning perception and action, and ii) neurofeedback paradigms to enable subjects to harness their internal states for improved performance.

"Non-technical description: Stretchable electronics have emerged as promising platforms for many important areas such as bio-mimetics, health monitoring, biomedical therapeutics, and soft robotics. This project investigates a set of foundational materials science problems to, for the first time, establish a new electronic materials platform - Si nanomeshes - for next-generation stretchable electronics. The transformative aspect of this project arises from the broad utility of the resulting design and engineering knowledge for nanomesh electronic materials, having profound impacts to not only fundamental materials science but also a broad range of applications in human-electronic interfaces and smart robots. The collaborative team also utilizes this project to integrate creative educational activities with cutting-edge research at multiple levels through: (1) engaging K-12 students via summer research and exhibiting at Oklahoma WONDERtorium Children's museum; (2) actively attracting undergraduate students for early research; and (3) the continuous curriculum development at both Northeastern University and Oklahoma State University to expand capacity in the soft electronic materials field. 

Technical description: Stretchable electronics research has long been facing the dichotomy between device performance and density. In the past decade, there has been significant progress in realizing stretchable semiconductors, however, existing approaches are still incomplete when high-density, high-performance stretchable electronics are needed. On the basis of strong preliminary results from the research team, the principal investigators hypothesize that with tailored nanomesh geometries and engineered sidewall surface states, Si nanomeshes can achieve simultaneously large stretchability, high mobility and high reliability that are needed for high-density stretchable electronics. Through both theoretical and experimental investigations, this project aims to investigate and establish the interrelationship of structure-processing-properties of Si nanomeshes for stretchable devices. Key structure variables to investigate include in-plane nanomesh pattern, out-of-plane materials stacking and sidewall surface states, while main properties targeted are mechanical flexibility, stretchability, and carrier transport mobilities. The project then achieves Si nanomeshes with desired mesh patterns through viable top-down approaches, prints and fabricates sidewall engineered Si-nanomesh based stretchable devices. A set of combined optical and electrical characterizations systematically investigate the properties of sidewall-engineered Si nanomeshes under stretching and scaling. Besides potential applications for high-performance stretchable electronics, this semiconductor nanomesh concept provides a new platform for materials engineering, and is expected to yield a new family of stretchable materials having tunable electronic and optoelectronic properties with customized nanostructures.

"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY

This project is an integrated experimental-computational approach that aims to develop a class of peptide-based supramolecular materials as high-affinity precipitants for non-chromatographic protein purification. The separation and purification of therapeutic proteins from their biological resources are a significant limitation for industrial manufacturing of biologics in terms of their efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Despite the high media cost and limited loading capacity, affinity chromatography remains the most widely used capture method for large-scale industrial protein purification. The rapid growth of upstream titers, due to advancements in mammalian cell culture and continuous process development, has further challenged the efficiency of downstream manufacturing. Affinity precipitation can potentially overcome the chromatography limitations associated with column size and ligand immobilization. In line with the goals of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), this project will design, synthesize, and develop self-assembling peptide materials that can specifically bind, selectively capture, and effectively separate proteins from their bio-based resources. In addition, this project will foster new educational and outreach opportunities for students at all levels to participate in STEM research and to experience different laboratory settings that range across academia and industry.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY

This project aims to address the key fundamental challenges in the development of peptide-based affinity precipitants for downstream protein manufacturing. There are essentially three steps in the use of affinity precipitants for protein purification. These are the: (1) selective capture of proteins of interest; (2) binding-induced phase separation from supernatant; and (3) recovery of proteins. The project includes three specific aims, each covering a key step toward the successful development of peptide-based supramolecular immunofibers for non-chromatographic protein purification. The first thrust focuses on the design and synthesis of immunofibers for selective capture of target monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The second is intended to understand, determine, and optimize the conditions for mAb binding-triggered macroscopic phase separation. The third aim centers on the protein recovery processes and the assessment of system applicability and scalability. Theory and multiscale models will be developed to provide guiding principles for the supramolecular design of immunofibers and the co-assembly strategies to optimize the ligand presentation for maximal protein capture, and to help elucidate the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of immunofiber assembly and dissociation, as well as the binding-triggered phase separation mechanisms.

"Planning is centrally important for everyday life. Planning is challenging to study, as it involves an internal search through future possibilities for action, in the absence of any sign this is occurring from the outside. The project will investigate two synergistic aspects of real-time planning: its biology and technology. Current artificial intelligence methods require vast amounts of power, a large amount of training, and examination of millions of possible futures to tackle simple problems such as the next move in a turn-based board game. In contrast, mammals require very little power, little to no training, and examination of few possible futures to tackle complex problems such as where to go to hide from a stalking predator. This project will develop a new online planning agent—a robotic “predator”—that will interact with animals trained to evade it inside a complex habitat. The robot will interact with laboratory animals whose brain activity is being recorded while they are challenged—via specially-designed complex habitats—to employ strategic behaviors in avoiding the robot. This will test and advance theory of neural mechanisms underlying the everyday ability to plan in real time in an energy-efficient manner. 

The ability to plan actions can produce much larger rewards than reactive, reflexive, or habitual behaviors. Whereas humans exhibit great proficiency in planning and executing daily movements, poor response to long-term threats shows its limits. Research on multi-step planning is in its infancy, constrained in part by behavioral tasks with low ecological validity. Theory has advanced due to rapid progress in artificial intelligence, but most formalizations require so much computing power that real-time planning is impossible. Animals seem likely to form real-time plans in some other way. In prior work, the PIs showed that a selective benefit of visually guided planning may have facilitated the transition onto land 380 million years ago because animals can see targets much farther in air than through water. The benefit of planning in predator-prey engagements is maximized in habitats that afford long sightlines while also providing obstacles that can hide adversaries. In these conditions, such as savanna-like habitats where hominins first emerged, planning its peak advantage. In Aim 1 of the project, this idea is modeled to identify locations of maximal planning payoff (via a network connectivity measure) and used to predict neural computation in animals. This initial algorithm is 10,000 times faster in achieving the same survival rate of simulated prey than a leading competitor in machine learning. This enables creation of a behavioral assay in which live animals are challenged by an adversary with similar planning abilities to their own. With the principle translated into hardware, a bidirectional benefit will emerge for Aim 2. First, neural activity—using Neuropixels probes in freely behaving mice—will be compared to the team’s theory predictions in real-time; they predict that boundary detection cells in the hippocampus and delay interval cells in entorhinal cortex are important for trimming the neurocomputational burden of plans. Second, during recordings, animals will engage with a robot that plans in real time.

"The ﬁeld of connectomics aims to reconstruct the wiring diagram of neurons and synapses at nanometer resolution to enable new insights into the workings of the brain. Recent advances in image acquisition and machine learning methods have yielded complete reconstructions of neural connectivity of large tissue samples. The investigators have one such dataset from a human brain tissue consisting of two petabytes of raw image data from electron microscopy. In collaboration with Google, they have spent the past two years reconstructing the complete 3D shape of about 50,000 cells, including 18,000 neurons, and identifying about 133 million synapses. This data will enable them to examine the prototypes of various neuron shapes, the correlations between these neuron types and their internal structures, and how they are connected to each other. This will be done in a dataset that is orders of magnitude larger than previous brain samples. These dense brain reconstruction results come with complex spatial and network structures, posing new challenges for scientists who wish to explore and analyze such data. The proposed program will develop a scalable visual analytics system that allows researchers to generate novel data-driven hypotheses from the petabyte-scale connectomics data.

This three-year project aims to build novel visual analytics tools and efﬁcient deep learning methods to advance the ﬁeld of connectomics. Project deliverables will empower neuroscientists to analyze large brain networks in a one cubic millimeter volume containing tens of thousands of neurons and hundreds of millions of synaptic connections. The project aims to analyze the brain at the neuron level and network level. It will investigate scalable visual analytics methods for the comparison of morphological features and analysis of spatial distributions and proximity of cell organelles. The network-level analysis will be supported, from local synaptic network motifs to larger-scale connectivity patterns of different cortical layers. A tightly integrated targeted proofreading/analysis loop will be developed, using techniques from machine learning for automatic error suggestion and guidance of the proofreading process to obtain high-quality data with minimal user interaction. To support intuitive hypothesis generation based on the data-driven visual analysis, an intuitive domain-speciﬁc query framework and investigate methods for automatic user guidance and hypothesis suggestion will be designed. Ultimately, this project will provide data and analysis tools to develop new theories of how the brain works.

"This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a single-crystal x-ray diffractometer for research, educational, and regional use. The instrument serves the needs of interdisciplinary researchers in the Materials Science and Engineering, Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Physics, Applied Physics and Astronomy, Earth and Environmental Science, Biology, and Chemical and Biological Engineering departments at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), as well as research and undergraduate programs throughout the region including Union College, Skidmore College, and Fairfield University. Acquisition of this instrument plays a significant role in the research, education, and training of approximately 10-15 postdocs, 80 graduate students, and 65 undergraduate students, comprised of women, underprivileged and underrepresented minorities in STEM, over the next two years. It allows for the development of new courses at RPI and enhancement of existing courses in the areas of nanoscale x-ray scattering and imaging, protein structure determination, and experimental inorganic chemistry through hands-on training in single-crystal characterization methods. Outside RPI and across the Capital Region of Upstate New York, the x-ray diffractometer enables crystallographic services to be offered to local and regional small liberal arts colleges and universities lacking x-ray instrumentation of their own.  


This single-crystal x-ray diffractometer provides unparalleled capabilities for analyzing crystal structures, phases, and defects in advanced interface and multi-domain materials. This award also allows for transformative research and characterization studies on (a) structurally engineered crystals featuring negative thermal expansion using Prussian blue analogs, (b) non-traditional photovoltaic and chiral bulk crystalline materials, (c) bio-inspired organometallic homogeneous catalysts for water splitting and carbon dioxide/nitrogen fixation, (d) ultra-thin crystalline-flake metallic transition metal dichalcogenides, (e) biological macromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, and viruses), (f) drug discovery and (g) anisotropic crystal orientations in semi-crystalline block copolymer-based ion exchange membranes for energy applications.

"This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award will enable the purchase, installation, and commissioning of a state-of-the-art instrument for chemical analysis of natural and engineered solid materials down to the nanometer (one billionth of a meter) scale. The instrument will be available to all science and engineering programs across the Caltech campus, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as to outside users. The instrument may be operated remotely and will be made available via the Remotely Accessible Instruments in Nanotechnology (RAIN) consortium for free access by student researchers and classes at minority-serving institutions nationwide ranging from community and technical colleges to high schools and even elementary schools. The electron microprobe is a basic tool of solid Earth geology and geochemistry as well as related fields such as meteoritics and planetary sample return, environmental microbiology, material science and nanotechnology. The advanced electron source included in this instrument provides a very bright, focused beam that enables imaging at high spatial resolution and excitation of characteristic X-rays from a very small analytical volume. Each chemical element emits X-rays at particular wavelengths; the count rate of X-ray photons emitted by a sample at these characteristic wavelengths is proportional to the concentration of that element in the sample. The electron probe automates the job of separating X-rays by wavelength, counting the number of X-ray photons emitted at particular wavelengths, and comparing the count rate in an unknown material to that in standard materials. This allows the electron microprobe to detect when an element is present above a low detection limit and to determine the abundance of each element in a sample with about 1% relative precision. Initial applications will include characterization of tiny mineral grains in meteorites that date back to (or even precede) the origin of the Solar system, experimental samples that reproduce conditions in the deep Earth or during collisions in the asteroid belt, and functional materials for batteries and energy generation.

The key capabilities that the new instrument will bring are the field emission electron source, the Si-drift detector energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, and the high-resolution cathodoluminescence sensor. While nanoscale imaging resolution, essential for targeting analyses and ensuring sample homogeneity, is straightforward, optimizing the spatial resolution of quantitative analysis without sacrificing accuracy or precision, requires special care. The new instrument will support a study of new approaches to unsupported thin specimen analysis as a path to high-resolution analysis. Challenges to be overcome include holding unsupported specimens in the beam path, updated software that accounts accurately for thin samples, and an extensive campaign of verification against well-characterized standards. Turning to more of the applications of the new instrument and its improved imaging and analysis capabilities, researchers will focus on several goals. These include: (1) analysis of experimental samples to probe diffusion at short length scales, fine-grained multiphase assemblages, and synthesized starting materials whose homogeneity at the nano-scale is essential information; (2) analysis of terrestrial igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks including basaltic glasses that may contain nano-inclusions, zircons for geochronology, and redox-sensitive tracers with unknown hosting phases; (3) analysis of meteorites and new nano-minerals including refractory inclusions, high-pressure shock-induced phases, non-destructive bulk analysis, and bio-synthetic single-domain magnetic crystals; and (4) analysis of microbiological specimens from the environment and culture, with single-cell resolution of the distribution of key macro- and micro-nutrient elements.  This award was co-funded by the MRI program and the Instrumentation and Facilities program in the Earth Science Division.

"This research program establishes new methods to analyze and predict chromosomal organization and  dynamics  in  living  cells.   Furthermore,  the  foundational  theoretical  development  in  this  research  program  is  transferable  to  a  broad  range  of  biological  processes  that  are  driven  by  non-equilibrium  active forces.  In addition, the specific biological processes that the PI will tackle provide new fundamental insight in top phenomena that are central to our understanding of chromosomal organization and function.  Reproduction and epigenetic regulation represent two of the most critical defining features in human biology.  This research  program  brings  quantitative  physical  insight  into  the  molecular  origins  of  how  we  reproduce  and how we establish and maintain our multi-cellular programming, providing fundamental insight and predictive tools for interpreting experimental measurements. This research program is defined by several key deliverables that provide educational resources that impact a  range  of  communities. The educational  program  includes  the  establishment  of  LABScI  (Laboratory  Activities for Broadened Scientific Instruction) to develop and implement laboratory science and engineering teaching modules for high school students that are being treated for childhood cancer and other illnesses. The LABScI program engages undergraduate and graduate students to develop the teaching modules, resulting in an exciting opportunity for students to enrich their educational experience. The PI will partner with the School of Education at Stanford University to expand the LACScI program and develop educational materials that effectively integrate online education with hands-on laboratory activities. New software development in  the PI's  lab  aims  to  consolidate  computational  approaches  in  physics-based  modeling,  genomic and bioinformatic analysis,  and data-science methods.  Coupled to the software development is an effort to provide educational resources that aid the implementation of these disparate approaches.  New efforts in education aim to demonstrate how to effectively integrate physics-based and data-science approaches as complementary tools for biological analysis.

The  instructions  for  all  biological  processes  in  human  cells  are  contained  within  chromosomes  whose  total  DNA  length  is  roughly  one  meter.   These  massive  DNA  polymers  must  be  capable  of  organizing  and rearranging  in  response  to  cell-cycle  events  that  are  central  to  biological  function. The PIs  existing  theory  of polymer  dynamics  provides  a  starting  point  for  describing  chromosomal  behavior,  but  a  range  of  distinct biophysical mechanisms contribute to the behavior in living cells that are not currently captured within the existing theoretical models.  Numerous experimental observations demonstrate that chromosomal organization and dynamics are dramatically influenced by enzymes that manipulate DNA twist and supercoiling, mitigate entanglements and knots, and contribute active biological forces. This research program will establish a theoretical and computational framework for predicting and analyzing these critical biophysical drivers of chromosomal behavior.  In establishing theory that is transferable to a broad range of biological processes, the PI will focus on the following three key cell-cycle events: pairing  of  homologous  chromosomes  during  meiosis,  introduction  of  twist  and  supercoiling  during  RNA transcription,  and  the  establishment  of  chromosome  territories  after  cell  division.  Within  this  program,  the PI will tackle one of the prevailing challenges in establishing a physical framework for living systems—establishing a  unified  predictive  theory  for  non-equilibrium  matter.   In  this  effort, he will  develop  a  new  theory  of  active-Brownian matter that provides a clear pathway for prediction of the role of transient enzymatic fluctuations in driving biological processes.  This theoretical approach reveals a prevailing concept—the time-dependent temperature—that serves as a consolidating framework for capturing non-equilibrium behavior in living bio-logical systems, and will exploit this theoretical approach in specific problems that are central to the understanding of chromosomal biophysics.

"A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's Indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This Targeted STEM Infusion Project (TSIP) aligns directly with that goal, and moreover seeks to increase research activities and opportunities for students to conduct research at several tribal colleges. The project aims to strengthen existing relationships among STEM faculty at the participating institutions (Aaniiih Nakoda College (ANC), Little Big Horn College (LBHC), Stone Child College (SCC), and Montana State University (MSU)) and build new course-based research experiences for American Indian students. 

The project aims to increase participation of American Indian students in STEM research and increase research capacity at tribal colleges in Montana. The project supports the expansion of locally relevant CUREs at ANC and LBHC while initiating course-based research experiences (CUREs) at two additional tribal colleges. MSU faculty will provide training on implementing an existing co-developed CURE module, using zebrafish as an environmental indicator species, and support tribal college faculty in designing novel CUREs based on research conducted at tribal colleges. CUREs are integrated into the curriculum at each institution, reaching a range of students who have not been exposed to research opportunities. Students will develop independent hypotheses to test within the larger CURE theme. Participating faculty will learn research techniques and receive training on instrumentation and curriculum. Research findings will be shared through community exhibitions and presentations at national conferences.

"Access to clean water is a fundamental requirement for a healthy society. Numerous water safety crises in the past decade have shown that access to safe drinking water is not a guarantee, however. Moreover, there is community- and individual-level heterogeneity in relative vulnerability to water problems. Individual characteristics are likely to affect perceptions of water, in turn affecting decisions surrounding water use and associated health outcomes. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of scientists to examine social, behavioral, health, and climatic issues related to water resources. In addition to developing capacity at a minority-serving institution, the project  advances undergraduate teaching and training through curricular development and hands-on research opportunities. 

The project tests social science theories positing that ecological and social factors work together to affect water and climate vulnerability. Research objectives include examining the influence of social, economic, and political factors in water quality remediation efforts in a context with contemporary and historical variation in deployment of such efforts; and providing an analytical framework transferable to other environmental remediation projects. To do so, this project documents perceptions of water among diverse stakeholders, and how these perceptions interact with individual and community characteristics. The project also analyzes and provides data to document the full range of climate variability to layer results within broader historical climatic fluctuations. Importantly, this climate history will provide context for the lived experiences of people in the region over space and time and allow improved modeling to anticipate future changes in precipitation and water access.

"Across Earth’s ecosystems, microbes adapt and form communities (microbiomes) across gradients of energy and resource richness. Like the machines and electrical circuits we engineer, power and efficiency are key features that also determine the competitiveness of microbes in communities. Over evolutionary time, microbes have optimized their own molecular machines to convert available energy with high efficiency, minimizing the loss of waste energy as heat. Microbes have a range of strategies, reflecting the balance between the rate of new cell production (power), and its efficiency (yield), while also dealing with various costs of survival that reduce yield. This research project will test the hypothesis that microbiomes, assemble from individual members to form communities that also optimize power while increasing efficiency. This principle of power and efficiency optimization may apply generally across different levels of biological organization from proteins to ecosystems. Researchers will study microbiomes from soils and the human gut as model systems to test this idea. They will develop a new experimental platform, involving multiple compartments to control how microbiomes interact, with integrated nanotechnology sensors to measure microbial efficiency as heat output, plus advanced microscopy to measure yield as microbes grow. This work will test if information stored in microbial genomes can predict their power-yield strategies, and if aspects of microbiome diversity can be related to efficiency, developing a predictive modeling framework. If this fundamental thermodynamic theory can explain patterns in biological organization from cells to communities, it will provide an important new framework to predict how biology will respond to future conditions on Earth. Broader impacts include involving community college students in the research, in addition to graduate and postdoctoral students. Outreach activities consist of developing scientific videos for a storytelling platform, which would be available to the general public. 

Microbes, like all living organisms, maintain the order of life through the creation of entropy. They exist in open, non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems, across gradients of free-energy that fuel the formation and maintenance of structures (proteins, cells, communities) that enhance exergy flow, while attempting to minimize dissipation of waste heat – enhancing overall entropy production in the process. The assembly and succession of microbial communities are driven by flows of exergy, and it is the trade-off between maximum power and minimum heat dissipation that regulate yield (i.e. efficiency). This trade-off towards the production of entropy is a fundamental thermodynamic principle. As a biological optimization function, the optimization of power and yield aligns thermodynamics and evolution through natural selection, in that constraints such as resource availability or stress, modulate the fitness of an organism depending on the placement of their power:yield strategy across a Pareto optimal curve. How these trade-offs manifest at the community scale has not been empirically tested.  This research will test this by (1) developing a novel integrated nanocalorimetry-microfluidics platform to control gradients of resources and stress, simultaneously quantifying power, yield and entropy production in an open system; (2) performing a series of manipulative experiments to evaluate how properties of microorganisms and microbiomes relate to power, yield and entropy production and bio(geo)chemical outputs, and (3) develop simulation tools based on the thermodynamics of power-yield trade-offs to predict the emergence of microbiome function and composition. This thermodynamic theory is applicable to all living organisms, with the outcomes being generalizable beyond microbiome sciences.

"After a limb amputation, both motor and sensory functions associated with the limb are lost. Substantial effort has been devoted to restore lost motor functions. In contrast, there has been less advancement in restoring sensory function. Although earlier works have used sensory substitution or nerve stimulation techniques to elicit a single type of artificial sensation, there is limited understanding of how the human brain integrates different sources of artificial sensation, when multiple sensory stimulations are provided. This project will help understand the integration principles of different artificially evoked sensations of joint movements. By identifying key factors that determine the integration principle of multiple sources of artificial sensation, this project can generate potentially transformative outcomes for human-robot interactions, specifically developing brain-inspired sensory stimulation strategies that can enable intuitive interactions of assistive devices. The project will provide educational opportunities. Different project components will be integrated into existing undergraduate courses. Summer projects incorporating the sensory stimulation techniques will be offered to local school and community college students. Outreach programs associated with the research outcomes will be developed targeting underrepresented students. 

The goal of this project is to understand the integration principles of different artificially evoked proprioceptive feedback. The research team will combine psychophysical testing, behavioral modeling, and brain signal recordings to understand the integration principle of artificial sensory signals. Proprioceptive feedback of the joint kinematics will be evoked using vibrotactile stimulation and peripheral nerve stimulation. Both upper and lower limbs will be investigated to evaluate whether the integration principle is task or end-effector dependent. The research team will use a Bayesian integration model and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings to quantify how uncertainty and intuitiveness-associated attentional bias of artificial feedback impact sensory integration. The project outcomes will provide a theoretical basis for developing artificial sensory feedback for intuitive human-robot interactions, and will also provide a research platform for studying sensory perception.

"An award is made to Colorado State University (CSU) to purchase state-of-the-art instrumentation to study the microbiome. The instrument will be housed in and managed by the CSU Analytical Resources Core Bioanalysis and Omics Center (ARC-BIO) at the Fort Collins Campus, which ensures that this shared resource is equally available to all CSU students – including students at the CSU campus in Pueblo, CO, a federally designated minority serving institution. The requested instrument will be used to support a hands-on undergraduate research experience in microbiological sciences. The PI team, highly regarded leaders in microbiome and analytical sciences, will disseminate knowledge derived from this instrument through both formal and informal methods, including development of graduate and undergraduate coursework and lectures, laboratory tours, graduate committee membership, and undergraduate employment and training. A hands-on workshop involving the Graduate Student Microbiome Club and the student Bioinformatics Club is planned to introduce metaproteomic concepts and nurture a well-educated user base for this instrument. These educational activities offer improved STEM educational opportunities at every academic level within CSU in a manner that reflects CSU’s diversity. Training in modern mass spectrometry helps to ensure a globally competitive STEM workforce valued by both academic and corporate employers.

The “microbiome” can be defined as a community of microorganisms in a particular environment (e.g. human, animal, soil, etc.). Microbiome studies are primarily facilitated using 16S rRNA or metagenomics sequencing to identify the bacterial components present in a given microbial community. However, this type of analysis cannot measure functional changes to microbial communities (e.g. what are the bacteria doing?). Proteins represent the biologically functional output of genes, and proteomics is the analytical technique used to characterize an organism’s functionality. By extension, metaproteomics approaches provide thousands of measurements of protein composition and concentration from a community of organisms. Metaproteomics has historically been limited by mass spectrometry technology and computational challenges. Significant advancements have been achieved in both of these areas, opening the potential for more researchers to incorporate metaproteomics approaches in their studies. Researchers at CSU are interested in understanding the functional and structural basis of microbiome biology and ecology, with application to research fields including human, animal, plant and soil biology, ecology, and biofuels.

"Glacial ice cores serve as a museum back in time, providing detailed records of past climatic conditions. In addition to chronological records such as temperature, chemistry and gas composition, ice provides a unique environment for preserving microbes and other biological materials through time. These microbes provide invaluable insight into the physiological capabilities necessary for survival in the Earth’s cryosphere and other icy planetary bodies, yet little is known about them. This award supports fundamental research into the activity of microbes in ice, and directly supports major research priorities regarding Antarctic biota identified in the 2015 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report, A Strategic Vision for NSF Investments in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research. The broader impacts of this work are that it will be relevant to researchers across paleoclimate and biological fields. It will support two early career researchers, a graduate and an undergraduate student who will conduct laboratory analyses, participate in outreach activities, publish papers in scientific journals and present at conferences. 

This work will use previously collected ice cores to investigate englacial microbial activity from the Holocene back to the Last Glacial Maximum from the blue ice area of Taylor Glacier, Antarctica. The proposal identified making significant contributions to 1) investing how Antarctic organisms evolve and adapt to changing environment, 2) understanding how microbes alter the preservation of paleorecord-relevant gas and trace element information in ice cores, and 3) identifying microbial life in cores and their activity in relation to dust depositional events. Two recently developed complementary techniques (bio-orthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging and deuterium isotope probing) in combination with Raman Confocal Microspectroscopy will be used to assess and quantify microbial activity in ice. During phase one of the project, these methods will be optimized using deaccessioned ice cores available at the National Science Foundation’s Ice Core Facility.  In phase two, ice cores in a time series from the Taylor Glacier will be analyzed for geochemistry and microbial activity.  Research results will provide a comprehensive view of englacial microbial communities, including their metabolic diversity and activity, and the effect of geochemical parameters on microbial assemblages from different climate periods. Given the dearth of information available on englacial microbial communities, the results of this research will be of particular significance.

"Phytoplankton are a critical component of Earth's carbon cycle and thus play an important role in the climate system. Recent observations have shown that climate change can be a leading factor influencing ecosystem behavior. One specific example where environmental conditions may be related to the dynamics of the plankton ecosystem is an unusual massive phytoplankton bloom that was observed underneath the ice pack in the Arctic Ocean. During the Arctic melt season, the sea ice surface undergoes a remarkable transformation to a complex mosaic of melt ponds, snow and ice. The transition in pond fractal geometry revolves around a critical length scale of about 100 square meters in area, as isolated ponds grow and coalesce into larger connected structures with complex, self-similar boundaries. Moreover, the transition from isolated sunlight penetration associated with individual ponds to a continuous matrix of light associated with large connected pond configurations could help trigger the under-ice blooms and influence biological productivity and bio-geochemical processes. This work will shed light on key concerns such as ecosystem transformations under changing conditions of solar radiation; the melting process and the dynamics of living matter; energy balance in the Arctic climate system; and, the contribution of phytoplankton in the Arctic to climate feedbacks. The PI will explore how conceptual physical models arising in statistical mechanics can be used to efficiently characterize and quantify Arctic phytoplankton under nonlinear dynamics. In outreach efforts, the PI will convey to the general public the importance of rigorous and fundamental approaches to climate and ecosystem research. The PI will prepare illustrative material (scientific infographics) about this research that will explain a strong interdisciplinary approach to this problem. The scientific infographics will be made freely downloadable by the general public and educators from a project webpage. The fundamental concepts of ecosystem modeling will be used in a teaching context in computational and statistical physics classes. A board game based on these principles will be created and tested in local K-12 schools. This research will also provide funding for an undergraduate and PhD student, providing valuable experience in theoretical applications within the broad framework of interdisciplinary research. The PI will involve undergraduate students who are participating in the summer research program of the University of Dayton for minority-serving institutions to participate in this project, which will enable them to gain skills in modeling and teamwork.

This project will offer the universality of statistical mechanics models for making robust, quantitative predictions about critical transitions in phytoplankton populations where the full complexity of local dynamics could never be modeled explicitly. The project will reveal some universal links between recent environmental changes and complex behavior of phytoplankton communities and increase our knowledge of phytoplankton ecosystems, including bloom development. The methods and physical interpretation of living matter-climate interaction discovered in this research will also be applicable to future studies of possible organisms in polar regions of the Earth and ""extraterrestrial oceans"" beneath icy surfaces. This project synthesizes available remote sensing and fieldwork data in an innovative quantitative framework to improve description of phytoplankton dynamics.

"The abundance of microorganisms found in nature, including both bacteria and fungi, is extremely diverse. Many of these microorganisms can degrade a variety of polymeric materials such as biomass and plastic waste. However, the few known microorganisms that can degrade plastics do so slowly. More efficient plastic-degrading microorganisms could be leveraged as industrial biotechnology to recycle waste plastic materials and create value-added products. In particular, the ability to biochemically recycle high-volume, difficult-to-recycle plastics like polystyrene and polyethylene would be an important step toward overcoming a mounting global environmental and health concern. The project team has recently isolated several promising bacterial and fungal strains that appear to degrade polystyrene and polyethylene. The multidisciplinary team will work together to decipher how these microorganisms degrade plastic waste and use this information to engineer bacterial cells to improve degradation efficiency. They will also utilize a mixture of different bacteria and fungi as a consortium to improve the plastic degradation efficiency, mimicking how microbes work together in nature to decompose complex materials. Finally, the plastic degradation products will be converted into high-value chemicals using novel engineered microorganisms. The proposed work will directly accelerate the research and development of microbe-driven plastic degradation and re-utilization and will address a critical national need for green technology through microbial bioproduction and biomanufacturing. The project will contribute to the training of next-generation researchers through exposure to multidisciplinary science and engineering at the high school and undergraduate levels. The team will also create online learning modules, presentations, and social network materials that will build partnerships between academia and the public to communicate and enhance the scientific awareness about the future of plastic waste and the potential for bioremediation.

The project vision is to degrade mixed waste plastic and upcycle the degradation products into high-value chemical precursors using bacterial/fungal consortia and engineered bacterial consortia. The first aim is to identify the key plastic-degrading enzymes from individual microorganisms isolated from the enriched polyethylene- and polystyrene-degrading environmental bacterial/fungal consortia. The second aim is to create tailored synthetic fungal-bacterial consortia that can bio-augment mixed polyethylene/polystyrene degradation. The third aim is to develop engineered strains that produce a useful chemical precursor, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, and use these to create a synthetic consortium of plastic-degrading engineered microbes. Innovative high-throughput microfluidic technologies will be used to accelerate the discovery and testing processes. The project will yield new insights into the biochemistry of plastic degradation and conversion of plastic degradation products to high-value products, as well as significantly accelerate the development of next-generation bioremediation and green bioproduction technologies. In addition, the synthetic biology strategy, stable microbial consortia construction strategy, and high-throughput microfluidic platforms are expected to have broad appeal in the fields of synthetic biology, biomanufacturing, and biotechnology. The anticipated outcomes, focused here on polystyrene and polyethylene mixtures, are expected to pave the way for biochemical degradation and re-utilization of other complex plastic mixtures encountered in the real world.

"The specimens held in natural history collections are the documentation of the world’s biodiversity, including what the species are, where they live, their life history, and their relationships with other organisms. The specimens and the information associated with them are a timeline that records the changes in flora and fauna that have resulted from growing human populations, changing land use patterns, habitat alterations, species extinctions, and the introduction of invasive species. These specimen records are invaluable and irreplaceable, but they are also irrelevant unless they are both secure and accessible. To be secure, specimens must be protected from environmental hazards such as heat, humidity, light, and pests. Accessibility encompasses equally the physical availability the materials for researchers to study through visits and loans as well as free and open access to the data associated with the specimens using information technologies. The process of photographing, copying and uploading data itself requires the ability of workers to remove and handle specimens. Recording of data and quality control can be a prolonged and expensive process. However, it is also a valuable opportunity to engage with the general public in the documentation of their own biological heritage. This not only contributes to a better understanding of the inner workings of natural history collections, but how and why scientists explore the natural world.

This project will provide the physical and virtual access needed to the hundreds of thousands of beetle specimens housed in the Triplehorn Insect Collection at The Ohio State University. Beetles are the most species-rich group of plants or animals in the world, and they include many species that are serious pests of food and forests as well as beneficial species that keep pests at low population levels. The researchers in the collection will rehouse the specimens in new, secure cabinets, drawers and unit trays. The work will be coordinated with transcription of the data on the labels attached to each specimen. These data will then go through a quality assurance check before being stored in the collection’s electronic database. This information resource is open to the general public, and its contents are automatically shared with iDigBio, the national clearinghouse for biodiversity information, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the worldwide counterpart. The data associated with the collection of tiger beetles will be the focus of a citizen science collaboration. The specimens and labels will be photographed and uploaded to Notes from Nature, and with the help of lay collaborators, the data will be transcribed and then uploaded into the collection database. This work will then ensure the maintenance and availability of specimens and their data for future research, resources that are the results of more than a century of collecting effort.

Adversity in early life has wide-ranging effects on individual growth and development. Research has documented important deficits in growth, especially in the limbs. Yet, changes induced by early life adversity are almost certainly expressed in other aspects of skeletal morphology. This doctoral dissertation research project uses life history theory to investigate how energetic trade-offs impact bone growth as well as bone structure and dynamic remodeling to develop a more complete understanding of the effects of early life condition on growth and development outcomes. These insights also shed light on more general drivers of individual variation and the evolutionary and biological mechanisms that enable such variation. The project supports the training and mentorship of diverse undergraduate and graduate students. Results will be shared via publications, outreach, and educational efforts to ensure broad dissemination. 

The research project investigates these issues in primates with well documented variation in growth and development outcomes and in socio-ecological environments during development. The investigators test the hypothesis that individuals born into high quality early life conditions (moderate rainfall, mothers of high dominance rank) will have improved markers of growth and structural and material properties of bone. The investigators test the additional hypothesis that the magnitude of impacts will be stronger in comparison to individuals with multiple sources of early life adversity. The investigators test the hypotheses via analysis of long bone lengths, cross-sectional geometric properties of bone, bone porosity, and parameters of bone remodeling. The study is novel in its integration of standard whole bone measurements with investigations of bone’s internal microscopic structural properties. Findings leverage bone’s ability to act as a window into an individual’s developmental past, providing insight into how the skeleton responds to environments throughout life and more general insights into the primate evolutionary biology.

Learning what to eat, how, and where to find food are significant challenges that arise over the course of development. Such challenges can also be social, when individuals have to compete with others for access to food. Yet how feeding competition affects food choice and developmental outcomes is poorly understood, particularly in scenarios where food is abundant and distributed evenly across an environment. This doctoral dissertation research tests how variation in feeding ecologies, including food competition, affects food choice and developmental outcomes among wild juvenile non-human primates inhabiting changing ecological and demographic environments. Results contribute to existing conservation management plans and provide concrete training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students. Results will be disseminated widely to academic and non-academic audiences.

The proposal merges theory from nutritional ecology and life history to investigate the significance of feeding competition among developing non-human primates, who lack the foraging competence of adults. Major objectives include investigating: 1) variation in food nutritional properties along ecological gradients; 2) development of adult-like foraging competence; and 3) impacts of feeding competition on dietary development of infant and juvenile individuals. The researchers integrate novel and long-term data on food nutritional properties and feeding behavior sampled across a diversity of habitat types. They collect novel nutritional data from plant food samples as well as feeding data generated through long-term monitoring and new behavioral observations. Results inform understanding of the evolution of primate juvenile periods, by improving our understanding of how immatures are impacted by feeding competition, even in contexts where food is apparently abundant. Further, this research generates insights regarding developmental responses to changes in ecology, which are important for predicting population dynamics and associated implications for conservation efforts.

Both humans and non-human primates have evolved defensive adaptations against malaria via changes in the genome. This doctoral dissertation research uses comparative primate data to advance knowledge about the co-evolution of primates and malaria or similar parasites, including how malaria has impacted the evolution of the primate immune system and identification of genetic mechanisms underlying the immune response to blood stage malaria. The project outcomes may inform public health relevant research on the human response to malaria. The project also supports outreach efforts that focus on increasing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM research through K-12 outreach and computational genomic capacity building. 

Using a comparative functional and evolutionary genomics approach, the researchers identify primate genes and pathways that are differentially expressed in response to malaria infection, including those with species-specific involvement in malaria response. The researchers also identify signatures of malaria-imposed changes across primate genomes. The study outcomes can advance understanding of how the primate immune system has evolved in response to this host-pathogen arms race. The analysis uses an innovative approach to investigate primate malaria response in natural transmission systems. This study can help to determine which malaria responses arose through the host-pathogen coevolutionary arms race as well as explore how human and primate evolution has been impacted by the selection pressure of malaria.

Every thought, memory, and decision that someone experiences is created by different parts of the brain. And while great progress has been made in understanding the functions of diverse brain networks, their evolution remains less well characterized. This doctoral dissertation project focuses on a crucial network in the evolution of intelligence, the cortico-striatal system (CSS), which mediates learning and the regulation of behavior, two of the most outstanding cognitive adaptations in humans. The investigator measures the neuroanatomical variation of the CSS across many primate species, thereby enhancing our understanding of the evolutionary changes in the brain that led to the emergence of human intelligence and cognition. The project also includes public science outreach activities and generation of open source data. This research also has impact beyond the anthropological sciences by informing clinical research on species-specific vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases and addiction.

This project studies the relative size and connectivity of the CSS across primates. As specific subregions of the striatum mediate different modes of learning and stages of behavioral control, the investigator quantifies the variation of the relative volumes of the three striatal nuclei to understand how CSS-based learning and behav-ioral optimization have evolved in primates. The connectivity of the striatal subregions is measured across pri-mates to elucidate selection on cortico-striatal pathways that may relate to species-specific behavioral de-mands. The project employs phylogenetic comparative methods to model changes in scaling and rates of evolu-tion of functionally specific components of the CSS at different taxonomic levels (e.g., primate order, anthro-poid suborder, human genus).

The human gut microbiome is a community of bacteria and other microorganisms that has co-evolved with humans and plays important roles in metabolism and health. Rapid global industrialization has led to changes in diet, lifestyle and medical practices, all of which may shape the early life development of the gut microbiome and its contribution to energy storage and fat deposition. This doctoral dissertation research project examines how infant feeding and care shape the development and energetic function of the gut microbiome and infant growth and fat deposition. The findings can inform the understanding of how evolutionarily novel environments interact with biology and culture and influence the development of the human microbiome and its contribution to growth in early life. The project provides training and mentoring in STEM for female scientists and involves science and public health outreach in local communities.

This project integrates approaches from biocultural anthropology and evolutionary medicine to understand how early environments shape infant growth and metabolism through the gut microbiome. The primary aim of the project is to examine the impact of different complementary diets (an infant’s first non-milk foods) and antibiotic exposure on infant growth and the composition and energetic function of the gut microbiome during the weaning period. With a longitudinal cohort of mother-infant dyads in urban and rural settings, the investigators use next-generation sequencing and targeted metabolomics approaches to measure the composition of bacterial communities and short-chain fatty acids (markers of microbial energetic activity) in infant fecal samples. The investigators also collect qualitative and quantitative data on infant diet, health histories, antibiotic exposures, adiposity and growth rates from 4 to 8 months postpartum.

The world’s marine ecosystems are currently experiencing many pressures from human activities. For example, warming global temperatures have changed ocean chemistry in ways that influence the strength of many mollusk shells. These shells are key to the survival of organisms like clams and snails, which use their shells as a defense mechanism against shell-crushing predators like fishes and crabs. In addition to climate change, marine ecosystems have been stressed by overfishing, where the preferential removal of predators has cascading effects on their prey. One way to anticipate the long-term impacts of climate change and changing marine predatory regimes is to study similar events from the past. During the Mesozoic (250-65 million years ago) the world was experiencing extremely warm, greenhouse conditions. Additionally, shell-crushing predators became increasingly powerful, putting increased selective pressures on their prey. This study will use physical and numerical experiments to analyze how increasing temperatures and changes in predation pressures impacted the shells of marine snails during the Mesozoic to inform modern ecosystem conservation efforts. Moreover, by studying the exceptional strength of snail shells, this research will have applications for the bio-inspired design of crack resistant materials. The use of physical models for this research will also enable the creation of accessible, interactive 3D printed museum displays applicable to educational modules across disciplines including paleontology, conservation, and biomechanics. While conducting this interdisciplinary research, Dr. Johnson will mentor underrepresented and underserved students from high school and undergraduate programs, who are interested in biology, ecology, paleontology, biomechanics, or related STEM fields.

Changes in defensive snail shell morphologies are central to the Mesozoic Marine Revolution hypothesis—an event of predator-driven evolution during a period of greenhouse conditions. However, we lack rigorous quantitative metrics by which to evaluate predator-driven evolution throughout this time. This project will use an innovative approach to quantify prey response by experimentally determining how gastropod shells would evolve in a model system driven primarily by shell-crushing predators. This will be accomplished using a novel cross-scale approach, applying finite element analysis modeling incorporating both shell macrostructure (shape) and microstructural material properties, and validating the analysis with modern and fossil shells. This research will generate a theoretical morphospace which quantifies the defensive capabilities of a range of shell shapes and microstructural combinations. The model framework generated from this research will have fundamental applications for studies of predator-prey driven evolution, conservation paleobiology, and materials science. The world’s oceans are currently facing intense anthropogenic pressures from overfishing and a rapidly changing climate, which are highly likely to negatively impact mollusks and fishes. This study will inform conservation efforts which extend beyond the temporal scale of modern ecological studies. Furthermore, the results of this study will have implications for the development of stronger, crack resistant bioinspired materials.

The project introduces new quantities useful for investigating admixture, studying distributions of the numbers of genealogical ancestors from specified source populations. It evaluates these quantities in mathematical models of admixture, using recursion equations that incorporate features such as changes over time in the admixture process, multiple models of mate choice, and source populations that contribute different numbers of males and females to the admixed population. Through multidisciplinary interactions, the project will also deepen the understanding of the genetic history of specific populations. The new models from the project contribute mathematical theory and statistical methods to the study of admixture in human population genetics. Further, as admixture processes in non-human species share mathematical similarities with admixture processes in humans, the project additionally contributes tools useful for studying phenomena of hybridization and introgression in natural and agricultural populations. This project includes funding from NSF programs: SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SBE/Office of the Assistant Director), Evolutionary Processes (BIO/Division of Environmental Biology), and Mathematical Biology (MPS/Division of Mathematical Sciences).

"This proposal was funded in part by the Ethical and Responsible Research Program.

There is growing interest in promoting responsible research and innovation around new biotechnologies, with the aim of fostering more socially robust and inclusive technologies. This CAREER project focuses specifically on the role of care in responsible innovation for bioengineering. It documents the growth and development of ""biofoundries,"" a new type of facility for high-throughput design and genetic engineering being built in academic and industry settings. Biofoundries are working to make bioengineered molecules, materials and organisms for a wide range of research and industry sectors, and are positioning themselves as being able to make significant contributions to a more bio-based economy. This research uses qualitative and ethnographic methods to trace the ""politics of care"" in biofoundries at different scales: identifying the many ways care is manifest in the day-to-day practices of setting up and running a biofoundry, as well as the broader values guiding investment in and governance of biofoundries. These findings are being used to design and test tools to help biofoundry practitioners and undergraduate biomedical engineering students reconceptualize care and responsibility in more explicit and intentional ways. The long-term goal of these efforts is to help transform the culture of bioengineering education and practice towards more inclusive and sustainable outcomes.

Using qualitative data collected through interviews, site visits and participant-observation, this project has three objectives: (1) to trace care practices in the building of high-throughput facilities for genetic engineering, (2) to examine the broader social and political contexts within which these facilities are being built, and how these are shaping visions of governance, and (3) to develop experimental tools and practices for re-shaping governance in and of biofoundries. This project builds on growing interest in practices and politics of care by science & technology studies (STS) scholars, in this case making connections with work on the governance of emerging technologies to advance theory and practice of governance. Research findings will generate a rich portrait of changing practices, relationships and accountabilities in a contemporary, high-stakes bioengineering venture. This project will deepen the methodological toolbox of existing responsible research & innovation initiatives, by developing interventions centered specifically around care. It also contributes to ongoing methodological discussions regarding the role of STS in engaging with and shaping emerging technologies.

"Vision is a process by which the image falling on the eyes is processed by specialized neurons within visual brain areas. Neurons in the early stages of visual processing convey information about small bits of the visual scene, like pixel-detectors in a camera. For example, a neuron in visual cortex might respond best to a small white bar at a particular location in visual space. Should this example neuron respond differently when the white bar is part of an object that we have seen before, or one that we are moving towards? Psychology might suggest so, but for almost 60 years, most scientists studying the neural basis of visual perception have implicitly assumed that responses of neurons in visual cortex depend only on the visual image falling on the eyes. It is increasingly clear that neurons in the visual cortex do indeed care about behavioral context – as well as the state of the brain itself. These external, internal, and contextual factors influence how neurons process the visual scene. Exactly how much these “non-visual” factors influence visual cortical neurons remains a significant open question that this project aims to address.

The experiments will record from neurons in the visual cortex of ferrets as they freely explore a naturalistic environment. Using position and eye-tracking cameras, the project will both recreate a movie of what the ferret saw within the environment, and track other observable variables related to behavior. The movie will then be replayed to the ferret while it is anesthetized, thus directly measuring any differences in neuronal responses to the same visual stimulation in these two very different contexts. Analysis will compare the physiological quality and statistical properties of neuronal responses across naturalistic and anesthetized conditions to quantify the contribution of natural context to neuronal responses. Results will relate the differences in the freely moving context to specific sources, like motor actions such as eye and head movements, familiarity with specific visual features, and their behavioral relevance. Experiments will inform models for how these sources influence neuronal activity, setting the stage for understanding the function of non-retinal inputs for sensory perception. The project will provide a foundation for long-term studies of natural vision.

"Wearable sensors show much promise for medical, sports, defense, emergency, and consumer applications, but are currently limited to obtrusive implementations. Akin to the evolution of cell phones that evolved from foot-long prototypes to recent smart devices, next-generation wearables are envisioned to be seamlessly embedded in fabrics. This CAREER project aims to understand the unique challenges of operating such textile sensors “in-the-wild” and to empower their reliable operation via closed-loop interaction among fabrics, electronics, and humans. To serve as a model and to inspire new applications, the project focuses on new classes of functionalized garments that can seamlessly monitor kinematics and/or tissue abnormalities with unique advantages over the state-of-the-art. Concurrently, the integrated education/outreach efforts aim to increase student and public exposure to bio-electromagnetics that are now confined to specialized research, yet can enable interdisciplinary training for all via appealing activities with direct societal impact.

This CAREER project will pioneer a design, modeling, and implementation framework that reconciles human-in-the-loop Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) with conductive e-textile sensors operating in complex (human wearing a sensing fabric) and dynamic (real-world) environments. Cognitive and fully-adaptive e-textile CPS are proposed that: (a) are cognizant of inputs received by the wearer, the fabric, and the environment, and (b) integrate agility in both the cyber and physical sides for closed-loop adaptability on the fly. In turn, potentials in optimizing performance, minimizing resources, and enhancing opportunities for myriads of human-in-the-loop CPS are envisioned to be significant. Without loss of generality, focus is on a novel-multi-utility sensor that addresses two of the most challenging sensing modalities in the area of wearables, i.e., motion capture and tissue abnormality monitoring. These modalities may be individually or concurrently employed to create models for dense-data (motion captured on the go), sparse-data (tissues monitored over sparse intervals), and context-aware (both of the above) human-in-the-loop CPS. As a case study, a novel CPS will be progressively designed – from concept to in vivo testing – to improve outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

"With the support of the Chemical Synthesis Program (SYN) in the Division of Chemistry (CHE), Professor George O’Doherty and his research team at Northeastern University will work to develop new methods and strategies for the construction of complex, oligosaccharide structural motifs. Of the bio-polymers/oligomers, including proteins, DNA (2'-deoxyribonucleic acid)  and RNA (ribonucleic acid), oligosaccharides stand unique in terms of their limited synthetic accessibility. Specifically, modern synthetic chemistry has established methods for the rapid assembly of peptide and nucleotide oligomers with both natural and unnatural subunits. In comparison, the ability to assemble carbohydrates into oligomeric motifs is limited in the ability to practically prepare the full range of accessible regio- and stereo-isomeric structures. These synthetic limitations inhibit the study and use of oligosaccharide motifs as new materials and therapeutics. The broader impacts of this project are to (i) the long-term benefits to science that generalizable oligosaccharide synthesis methods will bring and (ii) the training that these studies engender to a diverse set of students. In addition to the creation of new oligosaccharide structures and new methods for their assembly, these projects will give students training in the concepts and techniques of multi-step complex molecule synthesis. The students who take up these challenges come from a range of backgrounds and experience levels. This diverse group of students (high school, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral) is significantly made up of women and under-represented students from the US and around the world. The skills in organic synthesis that these students gain are highly valued by the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and material science industries, where most of them find employment. 

This project aims to develop new synthetic methods to access a wider range of carbohydrate monomers and the resulting natural and unnatural oligosaccharide motifs. This unique synthetic approach heavily relies on the use of transition metal catalysis unlike most oligosaccharide synthesis methods. First asymmetric catalysis for the stereoselective synthesis of the carbohydrate monomers will be pursued. Then an underexploited approach; namely, transition metal-mediated glycosylation or cyclitolization will be used to regio- and stereo-selectively assemble the carbohydrate monomers, or their carbocyclic analogues, into (pseudo)oligosaccharide motifs. The use of asymmetric catalysis for the synthesis of the monomers allows a degree of stereochemical flexibility to the approach that more traditional methods do not readily offer. The glycosylation reaction assembles double bonds containing carbohydrate monomers, which also engenders a degree of structural flexibility as well as allows for the minimal use of alcohol protections. Avoiding protecting groups can significantly reduce the amount of chemical waste generated. Overall, the project aims to fundamentally change oligosaccharide synthesis and in turn also change the application of carbohydrate chemistry to real-world problems in chemical biology, and eventually, medicinal chemistry.

"With the support of the NSF Division of Chemistry through the Molecular Foundations for Biotechnology (MFB) Solicitation, the multi-disciplinary team of Abhishek Chatterjee, Tim van Opijnen and Eranthie Weerapana of Boston College are developing technology to study the processes that allow pathogenic bacteria evade antibiotic treatment and develop antibiotic resistance, a defining challenge of our time. To understand how antibiotic resistance emerges, it is essential to study bacterial response to antibiotic treatment in physiologically relevant live-animal infection models. Such studies require retrieving the bacteria (or its cellular components) from the infected animal tissue. However, isolating bacterial components from such a complex milieu poses a significant technical challenge. The research team will develop a genetically encoded technology for selectively tagging proteins made in the bacterial cells, which will enable their efficient isolation from the infection site. Using this technology, it will be possible to monitor how the bacterial proteome changes during infection and upon antibiotic treatment, revealing the processes underlying the emergence of antibiotic resistance. In addition, the precise protein labeling technology developed by the team will be exploited to attach bioactive small molecules to antibodies.  These studies are designed to demonstrate proof of principle for the use this new targeted bio-orthogonal chemistry in the field of 'antibody-drug conjugates.'  If successful, such applications would constitute a potentially far reaching long term scientific broader impact of this fundamental science on biomedical therapeutics. The group hopes to engage in industrial partnerships in this space.

The principal investigators are developing a new class of bioorthogonal conjugation reactions targeted to the noncanonical amino acid 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP). They will apply this chemistry, which further leverages an engineered bacterial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) they recently developed, for incorporating 5HTP into proteins in living cells. The first application will create a fully genetically encoded system to tag and purify newly synthesized proteins expressed in pathogenic bacteria. It will involve: (i) an inducible biosynthetic pathway to generate 5HTP in cells from tryptophan on demand, (ii) an engineered TrpRS to facilitate stochastic incorporation of biosynthesized 5HTP into newly synthesized proteins in response to tryptophan codons, and (iii) the use of 5HTP-selective bioconjugation chemistry to tag and purify the 5HTP-labeled proteins for proteomic characterization. This platform will be used to investigate the proteomic changes in pathogenic bacteria upon antibiotic treatment in live-animal infection models. The second application will use the 5HTP-selective chemistry to produce homogeneous 'antibody-drug conjugates.' Strategies for increasing payload loading and attaching two distinct bioactive small molecules per antibody will also be developed.

"A fundamental and highly conserved code is embedded in all genomes and underlies biological life. This code is known as the ‘standard genetic code’, which defines how genetic information translates amino acid building blocks into proteins during their biological manufacturing process. Harnessing the universality of the standard genetic code has revolutionized the material, food, chemical, and energy industry. Although minor deviations from the standard code exist in a few organisms, the standard genetic code has withstood nearly 3.5 billion years of genetic drift by being highly conserved across all domains of life. The genetic codon is a triplet unit of a genetic material (DNA or RNA) that can define a protein building block. The mapping of 64 triplet codons to the 20 canonical amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, results in the same amino acid being encoded by multiple synonymous codons. By rationally building synthetic genomes in living cells, with a reduced set of synonymous codons, the liberated codons can be reassigned to incorporate non-natural amino acids into proteins. By systematic codon replacement, researchers are progressing towards the final assembly of a computationally designed bacterial genome that relies on 57 codons instead of the universal 64 codons. In this project, the fully assembled 57-codon synthetic bacteria cell will be explored and further modified for safe bio-containment and genetic isolation to prevent exchange of genetic information with the environment. The researchers will also build an open-access database to enable streamlined computational approaches for non-canonical amino acid incorporation. As a form of outreach, the researchers will organize a two-day open webinar series annually with philosophers, early-career researchers, STEM graduate students, and scientific experts engaged in synthetic cell engineering projects globally to discuss future perspectives and ethical issues associated with synthetic cells.

The standard genetic code maps the 64 triplet codons in the genome with the 20 canonical amino acids. Translating the information encoded in the standard genetic code to proteins further involves adaptor tRNA molecules, ribosomes, and amino-acyl tRNA synthetases. Researchers are progressing towards assembling a 57-codon Escherichia coli genome by replacing seven codons that encode the canonical amino acids serine, leucine, alanine and the amber stop codon with their synonymous alternatives. The liberated codons will incorporate multiple non-canonical amino acids and establish biocontainment for engineered genetic information. The researchers will gain fundamental insights on cellular plasticity by studying the adaptations of the proteome towards long-term non-canonical amino acid dependence. The study will also provide biological insights into genetic code evolution by tracking for processes such as codon-capture and ambiguous decoding during the long-term adaptation and dependence of the recoded genome to non-canonical amino acids. The project will also build an open-access database for genetic code expansion and make available computational tools to facilitate the research with non-canonical amino acids. In sum, it is expected that this project will provide new tools and knowledge for academic and industrial efforts related to genetic code and synthetic cell engineering while simultaneously facilitating the safe use of synthetic biological systems and communicating these aspects to a wide range of researchers and STEM students.

"A fundamental requirement for life and survival is that biological systems are robust, and that they maintain function despite external and internal perturbations such as wounding or infection. Integration of signals from multiple inputs (e.g., biochemical, mechanical) is essential to robustness, yet the mechanisms underlying such integration are poorly understood. The Emergent Mechanisms in Biology of Robustness, Integration, and Organization (EMBRIO) Biology Integration Institute will address this knowledge gap by leveraging state-of-the-art techniques for measuring cellular and tissue remodeling as well as imaging and data processing. The Institute's research will determine how living systems employ signaling molecules and intracellular second messengers (e.g., calcium), from cellular to organismal levels, to integrate signals and develop a coordinated, whole-system response to perturbations. An understanding of these dynamics and the integrated networks leading to robustness is essential for elucidating how organisms respond to attack and repair wounds. The Institute will lead to a greater understanding of how to support trans-disciplinary and cross-institutional communication and collaboration to advance science and education. Integration of activities will generate innovative curriculum and professional development tools that will be disseminated for broad use via existing NSF program infrastructure. These tools will facilitate faculty and trainee development of integrated knowledge and research approaches, like computational modeling, which will prepare students to be competitive in the STEM workforce and contribute to new discoveries in Integrative Biology.

Complex biological networks are appreciated as integral components of living systems; however, knowledge about system dynamics, integration of diverse inputs, and mechanisms to coordinate responses across broad scales of space and time is lacking. The EMBRIO Institute will innovatively address this knowledge gap by determining how living systems integrate “orthogonal” signals such as chemical and mechanical stimuli, and as a result of this signal integration, develop responsive phenotypes for survival and function. The overarching hypothesis is that multimodal signal integration by second messengers, as a conserved Rule of Life, controls and synchronizes the dynamics and organization of the cytoskeleton and cell signaling to restructure cells and tissues in response to stimulation, damage, or attack. The Institute addresses the hypothesis that, as a Rule of Life, this signal integration persists across taxa, leading to emergent behavior shared by the biological systems. The Institute will study responses to second messengers in biological systems from different kingdoms and over a range of scales, by harnessing big data (e.g., image data, AFM, simulation data) through AI and ML tools to process and interpret the data and bridge simulations across systems. The Institute will develop a unified technology to quantitatively delineate signal integration and the intracellular changes targeted by these signals, and a simulation-based fusion will be developed that takes the measurements and quantifications in one system and directly predicts the responses in other systems. The innovative approaches employed by the Institute are integrated into pedagogy through cognitive apprenticeship to advance a diverse STEM workforce.

"By integrating across disparate fields in the life, physical, and mathematical sciences, this institute is designed to yield a mechanistic understanding of evolutionary processes. The broad goal is to decipher the general rules by which evolution proceeds at the cellular level, while simultaneously engaging in research and educational activities to help build a formal field of evolutionary cell biology. An immediate goal is to determine how aspects of cellular evolution across the Tree of Life are governed by: internal cellular constraints, the laws of biophysics and bioenergetics, and the genetic features of populations. Specific projects include: a quantitative survey of how cells apportion their energy budgets into a range of structures and functions; the development of theory to understand the paths that are open vs. closed to evolutionary modification in various lineages; comparative analyses of the structures and functional capacities of the major molecular machines in cells; and the use experimental laboratory populations of microbes to determine how cells respond evolutionarily and developmentally to temperature and nutritional challenges. By identifying key details at the cellular level, the institute will greatly expand our understanding of mechanisms underlying evolutionary processes, while also revealing rational strategies for engineering microbes with novel beneficial functions and for eradicating harmful pathogens. A range of activities, including student-exchange programs with collaborators, annual workshops, development of educational materials, and establishment of an atlas of cellular information will expand the reach of the institute to national and international levels.
 
Over its duration, the institute is expected to connect with a wide range of integrative research and educational foci, with a common goal of bringing a new dimension of evolutionary biology to cell biology and vice versa. The research starts with several multifaceted projects, the first using comparative genomics, spatial intracellular proteomics, ultramicroscopy, and bioenergetic analyses to provide a broad phylogenetic overview of cellular features and the relative costs of constructing and operating them. The second project draws from empirical observations to build quantitative theory for the mechanisms by which cell-biological features evolve, in particular how the paths open to evolutionary exploitation vary phylogenetically. This project also takes a structural-biology approach to explore how major cellular complexes with essential and highly conserved functions, e.g., ATP synthase and ribosomes, are nonetheless free to diverge evolutionarily. The third project capitalizes and expands upon established long-term evolution experiments with microbes to evaluate the genomic changes that arise in response to selection on cell size and growth rate over gradients of nutrient, temperature, and population-genetic conditions, and seeks to understand why the phylogenetic scalings of growth rates and cell sizes have opposite directionality in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The integration of these projects will reveal the Rules of Life at the cellular level and establish mechanistic explanations for them from first principles. Involving work from scientists from diverse backgrounds, the collaborative projects build outwardly from the local to the national/international level.

"In daily life, people grasp and hold an object with their hands, such as a hammer or an egg, frequently and dexterously. These tasks require different levels of steady grasp force and exert different sensations on the fingers and palm. This raises questions of how the brain regulates sustained grasp force and processes sensory input from different parts of the hand. This project will investigate cortical oscillations using high-density electrode grids while human subjects perform sustained hand grasp tasks and feel tactile stimuli such as touch and vibration. Novel computational algorithms will be developed and applied to the neural data to predict the produced grasp force and differentiate tactile inputs to the hand. This project will provide novel knowledge regarding the organization of sensorimotor cortex activity in relation to grasp force and tactile sensations. Brain regions that show unique activity in response to touch and vibration will then be stimulated with electrical pulses to elicit artificial sensations. Insights gained from this project will play a critical role in the development of closed-loop neuroprosthetics that can replicate natural hand function.

Despite considerable progress regarding our understanding of the neural bases of sensorimotor behavior, there is very limited knowledge about the neural dynamics of sensory and motor cortical circuits during the generation of sustained complex hand function, such as grasping and tactile exploration, which are essential for common daily activities. A better understanding of the spatio-temporal neural dynamics associated with sustained complex hand movements and somatosensory processing is a necessary requirement for the construction of more efficient closed-loop neuroprosthetics. Utilizing advanced electrode technology, this project will record cortical activity with high-density electrocorticography (ECoG) grids, then decode multichannel data with computational intelligence for the identification of oscillatory patterns of the sensorimotor cortex during the execution of sustained hand grasp function. The high-density ECoG grids will provide recordings of brain activity across a large cortical space and with sub-centimeter resolution. Simultaneously, tactile sensory inputs--such as vibration and touch--will be delivered to different fingers and palm. The project will examine to what extent the cortical oscillations can be used to predict the produced grasp force and distinguish between different prolonged somatosensory inputs to the hand. The project will also develop a real-time system for the mapping cortical activations online, then stimulate cortical regions using channel suites and temporal patterns mimicking the ECoG modulations using a computer-in-the-loop system. The project will integrate neuroscience, neurosurgery and biomedical engineering expertise, to uncover spatio-spectral dynamics of somatosensory and motor cortical oscillations, and decode these patterns for the control of closed-loop hand neuroprosthetics. Outcomes will enable the design and development of neuroprosthetics more akin to the natural function of the hand.

"Microbiomes in freshwater rivers comprise hundreds of species of algae, bacteria, fungi and microscopic animals. How do these groups of micro-organisms interact? Are the interactions largely competitive, as groups of organisms vie for scarce resources? How many are helpful, where one organism synthesizes a resource that another needs? How important are these interactions for food webs, for the growth of algae in freshwater, and for the cycling of nutrients in the environment? This research focuses on Cladophora glomerata, a green freshwater alga that occurs in temperate lakes and rivers worldwide, and specifically on its microbiome, the hundreds of micro-organisms that live right on the surface of Cladophora. Researchers will use chemical tracers that reveal how elements like carbon and nitrogen move through the microbiome, because these elements are important for supporting productivity. Researchers will also test how the microbiome changes in response to nutrient and light, factors that drive the ecology of freshwaters. This research will improve understanding of how microbiomes support healthy ecosystems and the factors that can shift systems to harmful algal blooms. Novel machine learning tools will be used to develop a predictive framework for understanding how microbial species interact with one another and affect macroscopic food webs (insects, fish, birds). In addition, over ten students will be trained and educational materials including videos, written stories and artwork geared towards general audiences will be created. The training program emphasizes teaching researchers, at all career stages, and how to communicate their science through visual, written and oral storytelling.

This project will develop the green macro-alga, Cladophora, as a model system for understanding processes governing microbiomes. This research will advance microbiome science by combining hypothesis-driven ecological theory with the data-driven power of machine learning. Researchers will integrate ‘omics’ data with state-of-the-art stable isotope techniques, such as quantitative stable isotope probing, qSIP, which measures growth and mortality rates of individual microbial species using stable isotopes of 18O labeled water; qSIP and Chip-SIP using 13C and 15N, which quantifies taxon-specific C and N assimilation by measuring the isotopic composition of nucleic acids; and NanoSIMS, which analyzes spatial and temporal patterns of C and N movement through the microbiome and its host. Experiments will be performed to study (1) shifts in the microbiome over a well-documented successional sequence, (2) changes in productivity in response to nutrient addition, and (3) responses to light. Interdisciplinary approaches will develop new science in biology and machine learning through data matrices that span beyond the commonly used species co-occurrence matrices. Additional features that will be added include taxon-specific growth and mortality rates, carbon and nitrogen uptake, metabolism, and phylogeny. Adding these will improve our ability to understand microbial interactions in complex microbiomes. Using machine learning researchers will build and train models assimilating these multiple, simultaneous matrices of data (together, a tensor). This approach will advance efforts to generate interaction terms that reflect the importance of the key interactions (competition, mutualism, facilitation, parasitism, or predation) that structure ecological communities.

"Natural history collections are an archive of Earth's biodiversity, informing our understanding of the planet and ecological interactions that impact society. Recent global initiatives to digitize biological collections have transformed the scope and scale of how these biorepositories contribute to integrative biological research. Interest in collections and their data is increasing, however much of the workforce capacity remains the same. Entomological collections are especially important because insects represent the most diverse and abundant group of animals with over one million known species. Insects are ubiquitous in our everyday lives and an essential part of most ecosystems. They are also important to human health, as the majority of plant pollinators, disease vectors, and agricultural pests are insects. Collections are organized and maintained only through the specialized knowledge and experience of museum personnel, generally passed directly from one generation to the next, as no formal program has existed to do this across the community. This generational knowledge transfer has been especially important in smaller collections with limited staff, which represent ~70% of all U.S. insect collections. Despite their size, these collections are often extremely valuable due to their strong regional holdings. This effort will produce a comprehensive program to provide formal best-practices training, both in-person and online, to collections personnel, as well as providing much-needed networking opportunities for collections workers across career stages and institutions to share their knowledge and experience with the broader collections' community.

This award supports the progressive advancement of the Entomological Collections Management Workshop Series, including virtual participation and material, co-sponsored by the Entomological Collections Network (ECN) and the Systematics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (SysEB) Section of the Entomological Society of America (ESA). The workshops are scheduled to take place annually in summer 2022 to 2024, with hosting rotating between the Yale Peabody Natural History Museum, Cleveland Museum of Natural History, and Arizona State University. The workshop will be developed as a hybrid virtual and in-person event. During the 3-4 day workshop, participants will receive training in entomological collections management covering a wide range of topics, various topics including policies, specimen handling, curation, conservation, and digitization. This project will encourage the participation of collections staff managers and students associated with smaller collections, as they often have with more limited resources for training and collection development. This workshop will also help fund participation by students and early career researchers, the largest and most diverse (in terms of gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic background) segment of the collections management community. The professional development opportunities provided by this workshop will thus lead to a more highly skilled and integrative community of collections management personnel. The virtual components of this workshop will be shared to the broader community through the ECN website, with the results of in-person workshops also presented at the ECN annual meetings.

"PFAS are a group of manufactured chemicals that have been used in hundreds of different applications since the 1950s. One of their most important and life-saving applications is in the production of firefighting foams. The extreme stability of PFAS molecules makes them highly persistent in the environment, which has led to them being referred to as ‘forever’ chemicals. PFAS have been associated with numerous health effects in both humans and animals. PFAS are also widely detected in the environment, including in drinking water, groundwater, and landfill leachate. Unfortunately, commonly used water treatment processes do not remove PFAS efficiently. The goal of this project is to characterize the unique detergent-like properties of PFAS and use that information to develop an air bubble-assisted PFAS water treatment process. Like detergents, PFAS can accumulate at the surface of air-bubbles. The enriched PFAS layer at the water surface can then be removed leaving behind PFAS-free treated water. The specific objectives designed to achieve the goal of this project are to: i) characterize the mechanisms controlling PFAS interactions at air bubble surfaces, ii) identify conditions leading to increased accumulation of PFAS, and iii) use the results to develop an optimized bench-scale reactor using precision-controlled bubbles with commonly used water treatment chemicals to enhance PFAS removal. The simplicity and scalability of the proposed approach are ideal for application in combination with conventional unit processes used in drinking water treatment plants. Successful completion of this research holds promise for the development of cost-saving water treatment technology to help water utilities and other stakeholders address PFAS-related regulations. Additional benefits to society result from education and outreach to underserved populations to increase scientific literacy and diversify the Nation’s STEM workforce.

PFAS exhibit both lipophobic and hydrophobic properties, and thus tend to accumulate at air-water interfaces due to surface tension interactions. The mechanisms governing the interaction of PFAS with air-bubbles are relatively understudied, and there are significant gaps in our knowledge of these processes. The proposed research is designed to address this important knowledge gap to provide a mechanistic understanding of air-water interfacial accumulation of PFAS. These results will be used to develop a bubble-assisted water treatment process to efficiently capture and remove PFAS from contaminated water. The governing hypotheses of this study are that: H1) introduction of nano- to micro-sized air bubbles in water can effectively capture and concentrate PFAS molecules at the air-water interface; and H2) the stability and lifetime of the accumulated PFAS at the air-water interface is dependent on the individual PFAS surface tension, presence of cationic modifiers, and self-assembly behavior at concentrations below their critical micelle concentration (CMC). The specific research objectives designed to test these hypotheses are to: i) determine the surface tension, self-assembly structure at the air-water interface, and CMC of selected PFAS using conventional and synchrotron X-ray scattering techniques as a function of water quality composition; ii) assess conditions that can increase air-water interface accumulation of short-chain PFAS to improve separation from source water; iii) elucidate the impact of bubble size on accumulation and subsequent extraction of PFAS from water; and iv) develop an optimized air-bubbling system in combination with conventional coagulants for effective removal of PFAS from water. Successful development of this approach may lead to effective and scalable treatment technology for removal of PFAS and, potentially, aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) from various sources such as drinking water, groundwater, and landfill leachate. More generally, knowledge on the interfacial accumulation of PFAS may reveal previously unrecognized fate and transport mechanisms of PFAS in the environment. Additional benefits to society result from increasing participation in STEM through outreach activities with the Simons Summer Research  and Women in Science and Engineering programs to involve high school students and female undergraduates in hands-on research.

"Plants produce a diverse set of chemicals that are of use to humans as pharmaceuticals, fragrance, food additives, and agrichemicals. One class of compounds are terpenoids which can be used as agrichemicals as they are active against many insects but non-toxic to mammals, biodegradable, and compatible with methods used in sustainable agriculture practices. However, production of these compounds directly from plants can be challenging due to low yield as well as the time, space, and costs required to grow the plants and extract the compounds. Through advances in biotechnology, it is now possible to engineer production of high value chemicals in plants in a crop species which is simple to grow thereby providing a sustainable approach to production of plant-derived agrichemicals. In this project, we will use biotechnology approaches to engineer tomato to produce high value terpenoids in fruit and demonstrate that merging chemistry with biotechnology and agriculture provides a platform for sustainable production of chemicals with limited availability from natural sources. We anticipate that access to a sustainable bio-engineered platform for terpenoid production will be of broad use to both the academic and industry sectors. In this project, we will train personnel in technologies critical to a 21st century workforce. Through annual events and modules at the State Botanic Garden of Georgia, Michigan State University, and University of Minnesota, we will inform the public of the potential of plant systems for sustainable production of chemicals.

Over 50,000 plant terpenoids are known which are synthesized from universal C5 building blocks via the activity of terpene synthases, cytochrome P450s, and glycosyl transferases and function in plant defense, and as attractants to pollinators and symbionts. However, heterologous expression of terpenoid biosynthetic genes in plants is problematic due to the tendency for conversion of the activated products into conjugates or other derivatives via endogenous cytochrome P450s and glycosyl transferases. Using cutting edge gene editing and transformation technologies, this project will develop new experimental platforms and a paradigm for plant synthetic biology by generating two novel tomato chassis with minimal terpenoid biosynthetic capacity that will enable engineering of high value terpenoid molecules in tomato fruit. Our scientific aims are to (i) Rapidly confirm cytochromes P450 and glycosyl transferases involved in tri- and tetra-terpene biosynthesis in tomato fruit using de novo meristem generated gene-edited lines; (ii) Develop two chassis in tomato that are depleted of tri- and tetraterpenes (carotenoids) in fruit using state-of-the-art gene editing and transformation methods; and (iii) Construct bioengineered tomato lines that synthesize two high value terpenoids as a proof-of-concept. Within this project we will train scientists in state-of-the-art synthetic biology to facilitate new paradigms in plant synthetic biology. Through annual events and modules with three institutions, we will engage the lay public in the power of plant systems for sustainable chemical production.

"Strong adherence to underwater or wet surfaces for applications like tissue adhesion and underwater robotics is a significant challenge. This is especially apparent when switchable adhesion is required which demands rapid attachment, high adhesive capacity, and easy release. While organisms like the octopus and mussel excel at underwater adhesion, synthetic adhesives lag far behind, which is due to a fundamental knowledge gap in how chemical, geometric, and material properties interact to control underwater switchable adhesion. This Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) award aims to incorporate mussel-inspired adhesive chemistry with octopus-inspired adhesive structures to rapidly switch adhesion in dry and wet conditions. This will accelerate and build the fundamental knowledge of how chemical, geometric, and material properties control switchable adhesion to transform the design of rapidly switchable adhesives for stiff and soft substrates in wet and dry environments. This new knowledge will advance future economic and societal innovations in critical applications from transient tissue adhesives for prosthetic and wearable sensors to robot-assisted surgery, robotic gripping, and pick-and-place manufacturing. In addition to training and mentoring strong graduate students, the research team will develop bio-inspired adhesive gripping activities to inspire K-12 students to pursue science and engineering careers. This will be complemented by engaging future workforce leaders in adhesion science and engineering through career development panels at national adhesion conferences.

This DMREF award supports research to combine underwater-based dynamic adhesive chemistry with active adhesive geometry to determine how adhesion can be switched underwater. The goal of this work is to provide the fundamental understanding needed to design adhesives with tunable adhesion strength, high adhesion switching ratios, and rapid switching times. This will be achieved by integrating experiments, simulations, and machine learning into a cooperative framework. This research will establish for the first time a design methodology that amplifies the benefits of chemistry and geometry into a single underwater switchable adhesive system. This design methodology will provide opportunities to speed up the switching of dynamic chemistry by releasing the interface with active materials and enhancing the adhesion strength of geometric structures with dynamic adhesive chemistry. In contrast to prior work which has studied how chemistry or geometry independently influences adhesion, this work will uniquely determine how dynamic chemistry and active materials combine to control adhesion, providing new paradigms in adhesive design.

"The NSF Biology Integration Institute project entitled Host-Virus Evolutionary Dynamics Institute (HVEDI) will be established as a multi-institutional, multi-investigator institute to study host-virus interactions across domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya) with the goal of determining universal ""rules of life"" to which all viruses adhere. Developing such rules of life will lead to developing Laws of Virology that allow predictions for the emergence of virulent or attenuated strains of a virus, species jump events, the propensity for recombination events leading to novel virus strains, and changes in virus transmission rates under changing environmental conditions. Beyond the science, HVEDI is a collaborative of different university types, including research intensive institutions (i.e., Carnegie Research 1 and 2 institutions), predominantly undergraduate institutions (PUIs), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). Thus, a diverse array of faculty and student scientists will be engaged in cutting-edge research in virology and virus ecology toward achieving the objectives of the project. Results from this work will significantly contribute to a better understanding of how viruses may infect natural and novel hosts under select conditions. Outreach and training initiatives will benefit high schools and community colleges in Arkansas, Maine, and Puerto Rico and will build human resource capacity in these and other NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions.

Although host-virus interactions have been studied for specific virus systems, few studies have sought to compare virus-host dynamics across domains of life towards generating fundamental rules of life to which all or large swaths of disparate virus systems adhere. Using three non-lytic, low-virulence double-stranded (ds) DNA virus systems - representing each domain of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) -host-virus interaction properties will be modeled for each of these core virus systems (CVS). Mathematically-characterizable patterns that hold for all three of the CVS will be developed as models towards establishing rules of life (RoL) for host-virus evolutionary dynamics. The RoL will then be tested for generalizability to other virus systems (i.e., comparator systems), including lytic systems and those comprised of RNA or single-strand DNA genomes. These comparator systems will be used to validate RoL models towards developing a set of Laws of Virology. Three levels of integration will be pursued. Level 1 integration efforts are focused on integrating across biological scales (genetics, -omics, physiological, ecological) towards modeling host-virus interaction dynamics for each independent virus system. Level 2 integration is focused on modeling common patterns found across the CVS and comparator virus systems towards developing rules of life to which all or a large swath of viruses adhere. Level 3 integration is focused on applying the emerging rules of life for host-virus interactions to mesocosm, directed evolution, and larger-scale (i.e., ecosystems/ecological) applications. Wet lab experimentation will be supported by mathematical modeling and computer-based simulations of host-virus dynamics. Results from this work will contribute to the broader effort of understanding host switch, changes in harbor state, changes in virulence, and other related phenomena.

Extreme reductions in body size evolved multiple times within the primate tree-of-life, a process thought to provide evidence of convergent evolution. This doctoral dissertation research project compares whole-genomes of various species to examine the evolutionary processes and biological mechanisms explaining body size reduction in primates. The project leverages historical museum collections to generate novel whole genomes of primate species that fill important gaps in genomic databases. All data generated in this study will be made publicly available to provide additional research opportunities beyond the scope of this project. Outcomes of this research contribute to the understanding of primate genetic architecture, thus allowing a better contextualization of human genomic variation in an evolutionary framework. Moreover, this project extends bioinformatics training opportunities and accessibility of students from historically underrepresented groups.
 
Convergent evolution provides compelling evidence that similar ecological circumstances can lead to similar evolutionary solutions. However, the role of natural selection in primate size reduction remains largely speculative, especially when it comes to understanding how adaptation occurs at the molecular level. It is not clear if all small-sized primates evolved such diminutive body size via changes in the same genetic mechanisms, or if changes in different combinations of genes and regulatory sequences could lead to similar outcomes. To address these standing questions, the investigators will compare whole-genome sequences of pairs of miniaturized and non-miniaturized species to access the degree of similarity at the molecular level and the pace of molecular evolution. This research specifically examines: (1) whether small-sized species share the same genetic underpinnings; (2) evidence of selection acting in protein-coding regions related to size reduction in primates. Results will inform a more general understanding of how bodily variation arises over evolutionary history.

Humans have a unique suite of biological adaptations, many of which can be observed at various points in the primate and human evolutionary fossil record. To investigate how and why these adaptations occurred, it is critical that scientists consider not only the fossils themselves but their ecological and environmental contexts. This doctoral dissertation project addresses important questions about the optimal time scale(s) for investigating links between early humans and their environments. The investigators use data from high-resolution geological sediments to reconstruct and analyze environmental change at various scales of observation and consider how different patterns emerge depending on scale. The project also includes opportunities for student training and mentoring, public science outreach activities, and strengthening of international research collaborations.

Interpretations of large- and small-scale paleoecological trends are developed to assess how scale may influence interpretations of mammalian dietary ecology, as well as early human environments within a relatively continuous geologic sequence where fossil apes and humans have been recovered. The investigators develop long-term, coarsely resolved dietary data for 8 herbivore lineages for periods from 13-8.5 Ma and 5.3-1.6 Ma. They develop temporally refined, short-term dietary data for herbivores from 4-2 Ma. Each fossil sample is correlated to a specific geologic horizon— and subsequently a specific date—for which detailed paleoclimatic and paleobotanical data have been published. The project enables the diets of individual animals to be reconstructed to the level of vegetation type and then be compared to outstanding paleoclimatic datasets in order to better understand prevailing modes of paleoecological change in the region. These data can advance the integration of paleoecological patterns at various temporal scales to help clarify the types of environmentally-selective forces experienced by the hominin and hominoid lineages.

Research on primate biological variation can be used in a comparative framework in human evolutionary studies and to provide excellent opportunities for student training and mentoring in STEM. This doctoral dissertation project examines primate body composition differences through non-invasive measures to better understand body shape, size and physiology. The study advances knowledge about the relationship between physiological biomarkers and muscle mass and the development of sex differences in body composition, with the potential to inform research on human physiology and health. The findings from this study are disseminated through presentations at scientific conferences and publications in scientific journals, recommendations for zoo husbandry and primate conservation efforts, and outreach to the general public in popular science articles and zoo talks. Undergraduate students, including individuals from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, are involved in the data collection, analysis, and dissemination efforts of the project.

Male bimaturism is an intriguing aspect of orangutan biology and there is still much that is unknown about the flanging process and the physiological differences between the two morphs. Flanged males weigh approximately twice as much as adult females and unflanged males, but it remains unclear if this weight gain results from increased bone, muscle, or fat mass, or a combination of the three. This project analyzes creatinine and C-peptide of insulin levels in the three adult morphs of orangutans to assess relative levels of muscle and fat mass, respectively. It also utilizes body weights and testosterone levels in males to further assess these biomarkers of body composition. The investigators hypothesize that the body composition of the different sexes and morphs reflects their distinctive reproductive roles and social behaviors. While both male morphs compete for mating opportunities with females, they use different strategies, which are suggested by their respective morphological and physiological traits. Thus, the investigators predict that flanged males are more muscular than either unflanged males or females, that female orangutans possess greater fat deposits than either male morph, and that males in particuar experience a decline in muscle mass associated with age.

The microbiome, communities of microbes that live on and within animals including humans, contributes to important host bodily functions and can be negatively impacted by disturbances in a host’s environment. In this dissertation research project, the investigator examines how anthropogenic disturbance alters the hair, oral, and gut microbiomes of three primate species living in the same region. The comparative nature of this research advances understanding about how host species-specific factors and body region-specific factors relate to microbiome diversity in the face of external disturbances. The project supports student training in STEM and public science outreach activities, and can inform primate conservation efforts for endangered species living in threatened areas. 

Recent studies have shown that the vertebrate microbiome is modified by ecological conditions, and that reduced microbiome diversity is associated with host health issues. However, despite the compelling relationships between host health, environmental disturbance, and the microbiome, comparative primate studies including microbial communities throughout the host body are lacking due to the challenges of sampling wild primates. This project examines the relationship between microbiome diversity and landscape disturbance, hair cortisol concentration, body region, and host species. The researcher collects hair, oral, and gut microbiome samples as well as hair cortisol samples from three wild primate species in the same region. Diversity of microbiome samples is analyzed by sequencing the 16S rRNA bacterial gene, a highly conserved gene found in most bacteria and archaea that can be used to identify the taxa present within the microbial communities.

Though humans are remarkable in terms of cooperation, there are other social mammals including some non-human primates that regularly cooperate with non-kin and at the group-level. In some species, individuals are highly collaborative within their group, while relations are hostile between groups, suggesting that competition between groups may shape the social nature of species. This doctoral dissertation research advances knowledge about evolutionary and physiological drivers of cooperation within groups in non-human primates and examines the importance of competition as a potential driver of group cohesion. The project advances knowledge about animal social behavior and provides comparative data for understanding how group membership and intergroup conflict may have shaped patterns of cooperation in humans. The project provides scientific training to students through mentorship and field experience opportunities, and aids in conservation efforts by engaging with conservation organizations and local communities.
 
This project involves the non-invasive collection and analysis of behavioral and hormonal data to investigate the theory of parochial altruism in which conflict between groups is crucial for intensifying cooperation within groups. The researchers examine whether intergroup conflict influences within-group sociality in a highly intelligent and cooperative non-human primate species that displays hostile between-group relations. The project examines the evolutionary roots and biological underpinnings of parochial altruism by a) determining whether intergroup conflict impacts within-group socio-positive behaviors, b) investigating whether, as in humans and chimpanzees, oxytocin underpins participation in cooperative group ventures such as territory defense, and c) assessing at the group level whether there is a relationship between measures of social cohesion and success in intergroup interactions.

A life course framework views biological well-being as more than just a consequence of an individual’s immediate environment. This doctoral dissertation project analyzes how urban growth and climate change affected human biology in the past by examining both the timing and pattern of physiological stress responses that manifest across a lifespan. The project represents a large scale bioarchaeological integration of radiogrammetry methods with markers of skeletal stress. The examination of biological impacts of urban growth and climate change in the past provide a baseline for human experiences with stress reaction and disease processes prior to modern medical intervention and vaccination protocols. The results have the potential to inform modern public health research and policy in an increasingly urban world facing new climatic challenges. The project supports undergraduate and graduate training and a number of K-12 and public science outreach efforts. 

This project collects bioarchaeological data from two archaeological sites to test two conceptual life course models related to human biological well-being. The critical period model draws a link between early life exposures and later adult health while accumulation of risk considers how continuous and later stress exposures compound into differential patterns of health. Non-specific markers of skeletal stress that occur during different development and growth periods, as well as independent markers of infection, and radiographs are collected for individuals representing multiple time periods in the historic past. Statistical models are used to explore the co-variance of stress markers and how patterns of stress exposure at different times result in differential morbidity and mortality profiles. A life course perspective combined with paleodemographic analyses offers new perspectives on changing health dynamics in light of the demographic, climatic, and social changes occurring over time.

"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). Differences in morbidity and mortality are influenced by genetic, hormonal, behavioral, and environmental mechanisms. In nearly all living human populations, females experience longer lifespans and lower mortality risks, but perhaps unexpectedly, greater morbidities at some ages compared to males. This doctoral dissertation research explores sex differentials in mortality risk (i.e., frailty) to advance knowledge about the advent and nature of the culturally-dependent female mortality advantage. Analyses of skeletal collections from past populations are used to examine temporal and contextual information on past biological and social factors that increased mortality risks and affected demographic trends. Anthropological work on the production of health disparities in the past can aid in the management of modern public health challenges, including the production of current differential health outcomes. Additionally, the research highlights the connection between context-specific gender formations and physiological well-being. The project also supports student scientific training and public science education and outreach activities. 

The project examines the relationship between gendered experiences and physiological outcomes by examining skeletal markers of morbidity, mortality, developmental stress, and pubertal timing, using estimated sex as a proxy for gender. The researchers investigate the antiquity of the modern female mortality advantage (i.e., did females live longer, but have poorer overall health?) by elucidating the biocultural and environmental factors involved in the production of sex-based survival advantages. The project uses demographic data (age and sex) and markers of skeletal stress to examine sex differentials in mortality risk across time periods and regions and assess pubertal timing to better understand sex disparities in standards of living. The project utilizes statistical models (hazards analysis) suited to paleodemographic data, in conjunction with skeletal and contextual evidence.

"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). Puberty is known to be affected by nutritional status and psychosocial stress, but less is known about the role of rural environments and, specifically, exposure to chemicals that disrupt the endocrine system. This biocultural doctoral dissertation project explores how living in rural communities shaped by industrial agriculture impacts human growth and development. The investigators compare pubertal timing in agricultural communities that have high levels of endocrine-disrupting chemical exposure to non-agricultural communities in low-exposure areas. The research contributes new knowledge about variation in patterns of human reproduction, growth, and development. The findings can inform public health policy and public science outreach.  The project includes the design of K-12 curricula on human biology and pesticides. Individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM include participants in the study as well as researchers who will be trained and mentored by the investigators.

 Endocrine-disrupting chemicals like pesticides can disrupt hormones that regulate puberty, are energetically costly to detoxify, and increase chronic disease risk in adulthood. The investigators use silicone wristbands and gas chromatography to measure exposure to endocrine-disrupting pesticides through skin or respiration among girls in communities with high and low pesticide use. The researchers evaluate and control for the roles of nutritional status, assessed using anthropometry and 24-hour dietary recalls, and psychosocial stress, measured using a variety of validated instruments. Participant observation is used to understand the local sociocultural context and differences in lived experiences between girls in the agricultural and non-agricultural communities.

"This project ensures the long-term preservation and security of the mammalian research collections housed at the University of Kansas (KU) Biodiversity Institute. The KU Biodiversity Institute’s mammal collection is of international importance, ranked as the sixth largest in North America, and the third largest university holding in the world. This project replaces antiquated wooden specimen cabinets with updated stainless steel casing to rescue irreplaceable specimens from environmentally deficient conditions and preserve them in ideal, climate-controlled, pest-free housing in perpetuity. Safeguarding the KU Biodiversity Institute’s mammal collection ensures the continued contribution of these resources to biodiversity science, formal undergraduate and graduate education, and public programming for K–12 students, teachers, and public audiences of the KU Biodiversity Institute’s Natural History Museum. This project engages several undergraduate and graduate students in collections-based research projects and active curation. The physical specimens preserved at the Biodiversity Institute provide a critical foundation for research and education on DNA, climate change, evolution, conservation, and emerging pathogens, and are available for loan by researchers across the globe.

The KU Biodiversity Institute’s mammal collection houses 279,936 dry specimens in 332 cabinets, 185 of which are antiquated and compromised wooden cabinets that date to the 1950s and 1960s, and whose joints, doors, and seals are inadequate for protecting dry specimens from pest infestations. Specimens will be vacuumed and frozen at -40ºC for 2 weeks to eliminate pests, then transferred to stainless steel cases for long-term preservation. During the transfer, data from specimen tags will be verified and digitally recorded in the Specify museum database, and served to the community through GBIF, iDigBio, BISON, and VertNet. As specimens are processed, phenotypic characters will be recorded, including the reproductive status or molting progress of each specimen, and these data will be used to test for shifts in mammalian life history events overtime. Students will collaborate with Exhibits Staff at the KU Biodiversity Institute to conceive and build a new public exhibit focused on the importance of scientific collections. The exhibit will highlight research stories that illustrate how critical collections are for solving problems of societal interest, including recognizing emerging pathogens and tracing the origins of invasive species.

"This project will enable online access to a unique, irreplaceable resource for comparative studies of the evolution and development of the vertebrate brain. The R. Glenn Northcutt Collection of Comparative Vertebrate Neuroanatomy and Embryology, housed in Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), is the world’s largest and most taxonomically diverse collection of histological preparations of developing and adult vertebrate brains mounted on glass microscope slides. It is of particular interest and relevance to the current generation of neuroscientists who use molecular and genetic approaches to elucidate mechanisms underlying evolutionary innovations, but the slides are fragile and access to them is difficult and time consuming. By utilizing a whole-slide-imaging workflow developed through a novel collaboration with Harvard’s Center for Brain Science, the project will allow professional scientists, educators and students to easily and routinely access the slides’ content via high-resolution digital images. Such access will facilitate use of the slides in research and education and complement novel technologies for studying brain structure, development and function. It will facilitate collaborations between the neuroscience and biodiversity communities and, together with other projects that seek mass digitization and sharing of biological collections, it will enhance the ability of natural history institutions to more fully serve both science and society beyond their traditional constituencies. Indeed, the project’s imaging workflow and associated training components offer an exemplar method for rapid and cost-effective digitization that can be used by other institutions, whose slide holdings number in the millions, most of which remain dark data.

The project will use a high-throughput, semi-automated slide scanner to make high-resolution digital images of the approximately 33,000 glass microscope slides in the Northcutt Collection. When completed, the project will provide online access to approximately 500,000 serial sections and whole-mount preparations of adult brains and embryos of more than 240 genera and 270 species of living vertebrates. A cost-effective whole-slide imaging workflow will be utilized to process as many as 360 slides/week while yielding excellent image resolution (0.2 and 0.4 μm/pixel at 40X and 20X magnification, respectively). A digital image of each slide will be served to potential users via two online portals: MCZbase, the Museum of Comparative Zoology’s permanent specimen database; and MorphoSource, an NSF-supported online repository for specimen digital imagery. Both portals will be configured with Girder and SlideAtlas, two open-source software tools for whole-slide image viewing, downloading and analysis. In addition, for as many as 20 species widely used to teach comparative vertebrate anatomy, digital images of a subset of histological sections labelled to point out principal brain regions will be uploaded to BrainMaps, an online resource for vertebrate neuroanatomy. Finally, the project will produce several resources for training both students and professionals in methods for mass digitization and computer-assisted visualization of slide collections regardless of subject matter. These resources include four “how-to” videos, two online tutorials, undergraduate and graduate student internships and a graduate-level course in museum studies.

"This project will explore fundamental details about microbes that live in the air, the aerobiome.  The health of humans, other animals, and plants depends upon vast communities of microorganisms that colonize living surfaces. The same is true in soil and water, where microorganisms influence the health and productivity of those environments. In contrast, microbial life found in the atmosphere is understudied, even though we know that microorganisms can move through the air, serving vital ecological functions as well as providing disease transmission pathways. For example, many pathogens of animals and plants are spread via the air, and certain bacteria that are found in clouds are capable of influencing precipitation patterns. Key knowledge gaps about the aerobiome remain due to the technical challenges associated with studying this system. The interdisciplinary team constituting the Biology Integration Institute: Regional OneHealth Aerobiome Discovery Network (BROADN) will study how airborne microbial populations are altered by seasonality, weather patterns, and environmental stresses such as drought, intensive agriculture, and fire. This project will also investigate how microbes move between the land surface and the atmosphere, and what properties allow some organisms to survive in the atmosphere. Collaboration with regional partners, including a First Forward Institution serving rural first-generation students and a Hispanic Serving Institution will involve students in sample collection and analyses, revealing the fascinating unseen biology of the air. These and other educational programs will break down disciplinary barriers to educate the next generation of biologists and will share insights about the aerobiome to K-12 students and the public. The new understanding of the life cycles of microbes in the atmospheres is anticipated to lead to innovative solutions to key challenges such as the spread of pathogens, drought adaptation, and loss of terrestrial biodiversity.
 
BROADN will partner with the Global Atmospheric Microbiome Project (GAMP), the NSF-sponsored National Ecological Observation Network (NEON), and the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) to organize rigorous atmospheric sampling of aerobiome states and fluxes, and to conduct bioinformatics analysis of the genetically diverse taxa that exist in the aerobiome. Focused regional aerobiome samples will be collected over time at different altitudes and coupled with detailed laboratory analyses and meteorological measurements. Environmental chambers will be used for specific hypothesis testing. Data generated will provide the basis for discoveries of aerobiome structure and function, with the resulting insight used to parameterize models that relate aerobiome dynamics to terrestrial ecosystem properties. Bioinformatics and transcriptomic analysis coupled with mathematical modeling will reveal the microbial composition of the aerobiome; its response to changes in weather patterns, anthropogenic disturbances, and physical forces; the characteristics that lead to lofting, transport, and survival of microbes; and the metabolic activity and genomic attributes of aerosolized microbes. Moreover, BROADN will provide international leadership in this emerging area, and set global standards for measurement and assessment of the aerobiome. This project will develop essential understanding to drive solutions to airborne transport of animal and plant pathogens, and to understand the ecological role of the aerobiome in preserving ecosystem health.

"This project will provide critical upgrades to the Margaret H. Fulford Herbarium at the University of Cincinnati, including a move of the collection into a new facility.  The herbarium of approximately 118,500 specimens collected in the 1820s through 2021 represents a regional vascular flora and a world-class collection of mosses and liverworts.  The herbarium also houses Dr. Margaret Fulford’s personal library, which includes many rare volumes, unpublished field and laboratory notebooks, and over 100 binders of original, mostly unpublished original technical illustrations.  Recently, the University of Cincinnati renovated a new space for the herbarium in an adjacent building that houses the Department of Biological Sciences.  The new herbarium space will dramatically improve the security and longevity of the collection, and provides additional capacity for research, education, specimen imaging and databasing, and continuing public engagement.  Two ongoing education programs will be enhanced and will include a collaborative specimen imaging project involving developmentally disabled students, and a local 5th-8th grade “STEM Girls” program.  

This three-year project will support moving the herbarium into the new and vastly upgraded space by providing a compactor system and modern herbarium cabinets.  The current storage conditions are very poor, resulting from frequent water leaks and several catastrophic flooding events, which have caused severe damage to most of the cabinets.  These circumstances have left the collection vulnerable to further damage from water, humidity, insect infestations, etc.  The herbarium also has specimens that are currently stored on open shelves and are effectively unavailable to researchers or the general public.  In addition, ca. 12,000 bryophyte specimens will be curated, imaged, and databased.  These specimens, collected by notable bryophyte specialists Margaret Fulford and Jerry Snider, will be made accessible to researchers and the general public through the herbarium databases and iDigBio.org.  Finally, Fulford’s ca. 3,500 technically detailed illustrations will be scanned and made accessible.  Thus, this project will facilitate the herbarium’s ongoing commitment to open the museum doors to the world by creating a modern, user-friendly facility and sharing its invaluable collection of specimens and illustrations through online, publicly accessible portals.

"This project will upgrade the physical storage and begin the long-term process of digitizing the Paleozoic stratigraphic fossil collections at the Paleontological Research Institution, which are currently in danger of physical deterioriation and data loss due to inadequate storage and lack of digitization. The Carl Brett and Gordon Baird Devonian collection will be upgraded to the highest curatorial standards and its associated data digitized and made more widely known and available online to the research community and general public. This collection documents the unique invertebrate fossil record of the Devonian, ~418 to 358 million years ago, of the northeastern United States, particularly New York, which is widely regarded as one of the most stratigraphically complete in the world. The project will greatly increase the accessibility and discoverability of these collections for studying a variety of important paleobiological topics, including: 1) community-level stasis and change, 2) niche evolution in response to major sea-level/ climatic change and invasion of new species, 3) morphological stasis, and 4) environmental change and evolution/ extinction of marine biotas. The project has two broader impact components: 1) construction of an online field guide to common New York fossils, and 2) development of a series of educational videos. These complementary resources will highlight both the geologic context and diversity of invertebrate fossils in the Brett and Baird Devonian collection.

To ensure that the considerable research and educational value of the Brett and Baird Devonian collection is realized, this project will 1) upgrade the physical storage of the ~4,000 invertebrate fossil assemblage samples in the collection by moving them to a newly renovated climate-controlled facility, and 2) encourage use of the collection by digitizing and sharing records publicly online via data aggregators, such as the System for Earth Sample Registration and iDigBio. The project will also provide value-added geo-referenced data to the estimated 2,500 localities in the collection. Beyond improving the storage conditions and accessibility of the collection, this project will build on the Paleontological Research Institution’s strong history in developing free, online educational resources about paleontology and the fossil record. Specific outreach activities include creating a collection of five short (3-5 minute) videos with closed captioning for the public that will highlight the Brett and Baird Devonian collection. This series will be called “From the Field to the Cloud” and will detail the journey of an individual fossil as it travels through the steps from first discovery, to curation, to its final online representation in a publicly accessible online database. A new Devonian Atlas of Ancient Life will also be developed featuring at least 200 commonly encountered species from the Devonian fossil record of New York to help everyone from avocational collectors to museum professionals identify and learn more about fossils from the state.

"Toxic microalgae have serious adverse effects varying from fish kills to human illnesses caused by the consumption of shellfish contaminated with algal toxins. The economic impact from blooms of these algae can be devastating to fishing and shellfish industries and tourism. Over the years, much effort has been dedicated to researching new methods for the detection, prevention, and management of toxic algal blooms to mitigate their ecological and economic consequences. The Algal Resources Collection (ARC) is the only public culture collection in the U.S. focused on the growth and maintenance of toxic or otherwise harmful microalgal species covering a broad taxonomic and geographic range. Many of the species hosted at the ARC are challenging to find in other public collections and include strains used in the description of several new species that can be found nowhere else. The ARC cultures have been extensively used by the national and international research community in studies encompassing diverse subject areas, including ecology, taxonomy, phylogeny, and toxicology. Additionally, ARC researchers and staff are involved in outreach activities that involve various educational levels, including K-12 teachers and students, undergraduate, graduate and PhD students.

This project supports updates to the operation of the ARC through the implementation of automated imaging flow cytometry and cryopreservation capability to increase the efficiency in the day-to-day activities and better serve the research community. The imagery flow cytometry will allow for more efficient quality control of the cultures and provide additional information on microalgal strains (i.e., morphometric data, cell biovolume, maximal cell abundance, image libraries) that will be made freely available on the ARC website. Cryopreservation storage capability will allow the ARC staff to continue incorporating strains into the collection and bring many advantages, such as protecting the cultures against genetic changes and avoiding loss of strains due to errors during transferences. The project also extends the scope of the ARC outreach and educational activities by increasing toxic microalgal awareness among K-12 students through the development of an educational e-game to teach kids about the importance of reducing the nutrient load to water bodies to decrease the frequency and magnitude of toxic blooms.

"Every organism on earth relies on its DNA content (i.e., genome) to direct its life, growth, and development. However, the genome is not the destiny of the organism. For example, caterpillars and butterflies have exactly the same genome, but distinct forms. The difference can be largely attributed to the other important biomolecules that are encoded by the genome. These biomolecules are RNA and proteins, which can be modified in hundreds of different ways after their synthesis. Recognition of the diversity and complexity of modifications of RNA and proteins has changed how we think about their different functions of these molecules in fundamental ways in both large and small organisms, ranging from microbes to plants and humans. Understanding how RNA and proteins are modified, and their biological implications is very important in many areas of basic and applied biological and medical research. Improving our understanding will require building community resources, technical breakthroughs, and cross-disciplinary research efforts to achieve cross-cutting advances in RNA and protein biology. This project will support a virtual national workshop that will bring together 100-150 diverse participants that are actively involved in both the meeting and discussion sessions. In addition, all research talks, and discussion sessions will be open for anyone interested to watch through Zoom. The participants are from many different disciplines and areas, including plant, animal, and human biology, and cover research areas such as chemistry, engineering, computer science, artificial intelligence, and systems and synthetic biology. Keynote talks from leaders, small-group and interactive sessions will facilitate and stimulate researchers to address the following key topics: 1) Successes and failures in RNA and protein modification research in a variety of research organisms; 2) Experimental systems as well as research approaches that leverage all RNA and protein–related scientific disciplines; 3) Possible “rules of life” to guide baseline and comparative questions across the different realms of organisms; 4) Advantages and disadvantages of currently available tools, consortia, and databases; 5) Training needs for researchers capable of contributing to future advancement in RNA and protein biology; and 6) Short- and medium-term research and knowledge goals, noting potential strategies to reach these goals.

In the framework of our current understanding of genetic information flow, post-transcriptional modifications (PRMs) of RNA molecules and post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins are extremely important cellular regulatory moieties. Yet significant gaps remain in the integrated understanding of these two regulatory moieties and their effects on overall cellular metabolism in different biological organisms. Fragmentated research efforts in different systems (e.g., microbe, plant, animal, and human) and using different approaches and standards, has prevented integrative analyses of different datasets and identification of common principles of PRMs and PTMs. This workshop aims to fill these gaps and advance research from descriptive and specific mechanistic focus towards integration, general theory, modeling and prediction, and global understanding. Moreover, this workshop will promote studying the functions and mechanisms of the key regulatory modifications, of their roles in cellular signaling and metabolism, as well as their impact on organisms. The workshop will provide significant opportunities for cross-disciplinary interactions to advance the field of RNA and protein biology by identifying: 1) core questions driving/motivating PRM and PTM studies; 2) conceptual and theoretical foundations that provide a useful lens for hypothesis testing; 3) big ideas to drive advances in these areas and increased understanding of the rules of life; and 4) a path forward for collaborative research and synthetic analyses that will further integrate the two closely-related areas of research through multidisciplinary approaches. Early-career post-doctoral scientists and graduate students will participate in the workshop organization and serve as virtual discussion leaders, providing them the opportunity to network with many of the leaders in these cutting-edge fields. The workshop aims to increase broad participation of underrepresented groups in RNA and protein modification research, and serves as a model for integration of inclusive and interactive online conference opportunities allowing participation from broader audiences. Collectively, this workshop will identify critical gaps in resources and understanding of PRMs and PTMs across disciplines, and importantly draft a path forward for community-wide collaborative research to advance these important areas of research that affect our understanding of human, plant, animal, and ecosystem biology. 

Funding for this workshop was provided by the Physiological and Structural Systems Cluster, Plant Genome Research Program, and Genetic Mechanisms Cluster in the BIO Directorate and the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering Program in the ENG Directorate.

"For institutions of higher learning to meet their goals of educating their students effectively, the curriculum must be designed to acknowledge and validate the experience of their various student populations. The Wokini (New beginnings in Lakota) Undergraduate Biology Education Network will create a group of scholars that integrates Indigenous thought and knowledge into the teaching of biology, while meeting the core competencies as defined in Vision and Change in undergraduate biology education. Applying Indigenous methodologies and localization techniques will empower the network participants to engage effectively with underrepresented Indigenous communities in the design of an instructional curriculum that supports both an Indigenous and scientific identity. Using a collective impact framework, the network will address ways to increase recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of Indigenous undergraduates in Biology and increase the number of Indigenous students pursuing graduate education in Biology. Understanding that this goal requires engaging students in culturally relevant learning, the network is highly diverse and draws on knowledge and expertise outside of biology. 

The formation and implementation of the Wokini Undergraduate Biology Education Network will connect Indigenous and non-Indigenous faculty at land grant institutions and tribal colleges, enrolled tribal members, scientists, educational researchers, leaders of non-profit organizations and language and culture experts. This incubator award will allow the network to create a common language, shared understanding, and common goals through strategic planning, a virtual learning community, regular dialogue and a face-to-face summit in an Indigenous community. The network will collaboratively develop and grow a local and international network, which will create, share, and host resources through social media and an open-source digital hub for a more inclusive curriculum, co-curriculum, and pedagogy in undergraduate biology education. Resources will include case studies, activities, lesson plans, course based undergraduate research experiences, and laboratory activities. These activities have the potential to broaden participation and engagement of Indigenous students who are underrepresented and underserved in undergraduate biology and will also support all students in developing a deeper understanding of the life sciences. This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/).

"Land-use conversion in urban and rural areas has impacted >75% of lands globally, resulting in ~50% loss of the world’s topsoil in the last 150 years. Informed selection of plants based on an understanding of how they interact with each other and with the soil will enable restoration of degraded lands in natural and agricultural systems. Through their root systems, plants connect aboveground components of ecosystems to the soil; however, how plant traits, from roots to shoots (stems and leaves), govern these connections remains poorly known. Plants are unusual among organisms because half of the plant body lives aboveground, in air, while the other half lives belowground, in soil. The scientific mission of the New Roots for Restoration Biology Integration Institute is to address land losses by understanding how the soil ecosphere (soil and soil microbes) and the plant community influences above and below ground variation in plant traits, and vice versa: how do above- and belowground plant traits influence properties of plant communities and the soil ecosphere? Scientific advances made by the Institute will improve our ability to predict below-ground functional traits based on above-ground structures. This information can be applied to accelerate breeding (for perennial crops) and select suitably diverse plants (for wild species) for use in ecologically and functionally appropriate efforts to restore natural and agricultural ecosystems. Recognizing that restoration requires a diverse, nimble workforce that spans disciplines, the Institute establishes education, training, diversifying, and outreach intentionally designed with many points of entry and ready mobility across labs and institutions.


The New Roots for Restoration Biology Integration Institute advances the critical, cross-cutting biological theme of how plant roots and shoots relate to one another, and how those relationships influence and are influenced by plant communities and the soil ecosphere. Scientific activities focus on genetic and environmental determinants of perennial plant phenotypes, and the influence of perennial phenotypes on communities and ecosystems using representative species from three prominent plant families (Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae). A series of concentric circles orient research activities: at the core are plant organismal systems, in which contemporary phenotyping approaches quantify root and shoot systems and are used to understand how above- and belowground plant traits covary among individuals, populations, and species. Next, plants are placed in population and community contexts to investigate how patterns of above- and belowground trait covariation shift across populations and as a function of plant community composition. To understand interactions between plants, communities, and the soil ecosphere, new experiments examine how soil and soil microbiome mediate root/shoot variation and interactions of populations and plant species, and vice versa. Finally, structural equation modeling is used to assess relative importance of plant phenotypic variation, species, communities, and site properties to changes in soil. New Roots for Restoration engages researchers from disparate disciplines (agroecology, community ecology, computer science, genetics, plant biology, restoration, soil microbial ecology, soil science), research contexts (natural, agricultural systems), and organizations (non-profit research institutes, universities, botanical gardens), and is supported by Institute Expertise Cores that provide technical training and data consistency across projects.

"Many colleges and universities aspire to diversify their STEM student bodies and create more inclusive and equitable learning environments for the students. At the same time, many struggle with limited resources and less-than-optimal infrastructure. Using a system that integrates all components of an institutional STEM mentoring ecosystem can have greater potential for making substantive and lasting changes across a range of demographics. This project builds upon a recently-developed STEM-Mentoring Ecosystems (STEM-ME) framework that facilitates self-assessment of institutional strengths, vulnerabilities, synergies and disconnects related to mentoring. Given that many mentoring programs targeted at students, staff, or faculty are siloed in nature, an ecosystems approach will facilitate a more sustainable and effective infrastructure. The STEM-ME framework will facilitate the leveraging of resources, building of synergies and integration of best practices across a diverse and at times isolated set of institutional efforts. This project will convene workshops comprised of teams from multiple institutions who will engage in learning about and applying the STEM-ME framework to improve their local mentoring ecosystems. Based on discussions, each campus team will revise the STEM-ME materials to make them applicable to their local situations. Outcomes of the workshop will include new insights for campuses, new resource materials, and new knowledge about common assets and vulnerabilities across a range of institutional types.

There is abundant extant research on barriers and outcomes of STEM mentoring at the individual relationship level, but less is known at the institutional and cross-institutional levels.  A recent report on “The Science of Effective Mentoring in STEMM” (2019) by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has brought increased attention to improving mentoring environments to retain STEM talent from all segments of the population. This proposal will pilot a study that uses a STEM-Mentoring Ecosystems (STEM-ME) framework to effect changes in institutional practice towards a more inclusive and equitable environment. Sessions will be convened to provide teams from several campuses opportunities to learn about and craft their institution-specific blueprint of the STEM-ME framework. The goals of this workshop are: (1) to improve the STEM mentoring ecosystems particularly for minoritized students across campus types; (2) to develop  mechanisms (including a white paper and self-guided module) that helps campuses to assess their own campus infrastructure, identify connections/synergies, and strengthen their infrastructure for high-quality, inclusive STEM mentoring; (3) to assist participating campuses, and their leaders, begin this process and contribute to this process in a meaningful way; and, (4) to reflect back to stakeholders of STEM mentoring ecosystems where there are common vulnerabilities and areas of strength. The collaborative workshop will consist of two required sessions and an optional session. The first session will involve an introduction of the STEM-ME framework and mapping worksheet and multi-institutional team introductions. The second session involves sharing of campus-specific mentoring ecosystem maps and discussions of commonalities and differences between campuses. Finally, the optional third session will allow each team to have a one-on-one consulting session with one of the facilitators. The broader impacts of the proposal include the creation of tools (e.g. STEM-ME mapping worksheet, white paper, institutional action plans) that will help campuses enhance their STEM mentoring infrastructure. Multiple graduate and undergraduate students will gain research training on organizational change in STEM.

"Nontechnical summary

This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award is to acquire a high-throughput small angle x-ray scattering (HT-SAXS) instrument to accelerate the discovery of a wide range of nanostructured materials.  Nanostructured materials are essential elements for the development of new technologies in healthcare, clean energy, and environmental sustainability among many others. The HT-SAXS instrument is especially configured to use x-rays to non-destructively analyze material structures over a broad range of size scales. This precise measurement of structure is critical to the design of materials that have specific properties (e.g. mechanical, electronic, optical) to meet the needs of their target end-use applications. The instrument is also uniquely configured to analyze a broad range of materials (e.g. polymers, gels, proteins, particles and composites) very quickly and automatically, through the use of robotic sample handling features, so that it can operate efficiently and autonomously to enable the execution of high-throughput experiments.  In addition, acquisition of this instrument will see implementation of advanced data science and artificial intelligence algorithms for accelerated materials design. This HT-SAXS instrument enables a large and diverse group of researchers and students, distributed across several pacific northwest research institutions, to openly access state of the art x-ray instrumentation to meet critical needs for research, education and workforce development.      

Technical summary

The HT-SAXS instrument seamlessly integrates Bonse-Hart optics for Ultra-SAXS (USAXS), pinhole SAXS and wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) to analyze nanomaterials with structural features ranging from 0.1 nm to 5,000 nm. It uses motorized collimation optics, detector motion and autonomous sample-changing capabilities to enable its use in data-driven materials design problems where statistical design of experiments, advanced data visualization and knowledge extraction via machine learning is facilitated. the instrument's grazing incidence small angle scattering cell is used for the analysis of conjugated polymers, molecules and blends with commodity polymers to produce materials with optimized optoelectronic properties.  The HT-SAXS instrument enables and accelerates numerous data-driven materials research projects including colloidal systems such as emulsions and nanocrystals as well as for block-copolymers, polymer blends and cyclic bottle-brush polymers, de-novo designer proteins, organic frameworks, bio-composite plastics, as well as educational activities.

"Paramount to predicting the future of biodiversity is knowing when and how living systems are resilient to (i.e., can recover from) anthropogenic disturbances. The focus of this Biology Integration Institute is on understanding resilience to a key global threat: emerging infectious diseases. The team will develop a new framework to measure resilience across multiple scales, stressors, and systems, and apply it to a case study involving a fungal disease linked to global amphibian declines. Building on past research in four complementary systems, the team will address four questions: (1) How does the history of disturbance differ across systems? (2) How have changes at different levels of biological organization shaped overall system responses? (3) What are the mechanisms contributing to resilience and are they shared across systems? (4) How is resilience modulated by multiple interacting stressors? The framework and findings will be applicable to hundreds of amphibian species facing disease-related stressors and, more broadly, for understanding the resilience of biological systems to myriad global change threats. The Institute’s training activities will reach and connect high school through postdoctoral scholars using authentic biology research experiences that foster cross-disciplinary understanding, serve large numbers of students with a focus on underrepresented groups, and promote persistence in STEM. Outreach activities will reach students, teachers, members of the public, and wildlife managers with messages about biodiversity, resilience, and global change. Together, the institute’s activities will showcase the power of an integrative, team science approach for addressing some of the biggest and most challenging questions in biology.

The focus of this Biology Integration Institute (BII) is on understanding resilience in the context of global change. Resilience, or the ability to recover after a perturbation, is an emergent property of living systems. Progress toward a mechanistic understanding has been stymied by the lack of a common currency and framework that is applicable across scales, among systems, and in response to different stressors. The team’s activities will address these knowledge gaps by developing a flexible resilience framework and applying it to a detailed case study involving a key global change threat to biodiversity: emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Leveraging past research, the team aims to uncover mechanisms of resilience to chytridiomycosis, an EID of amphibians caused by a fungal pathogen, in four complementary systems by answering four key questions: (1) How does the history of disturbance differ across systems? (2) How have changes at different levels of biological organization shaped overall system responses? (3) What are the mechanisms contributing to resilience and are they shared across systems? (4) How is resilience modulated by multiple interacting stressors? The Institute’s training and outreach programs will feed back into the research. Training activities will reach and connect high school through postdoctoral scholars from across the country through authentic biology research experiences that foster cross-disciplinary understanding, serve large numbers of students with a focus on underrepresented groups, and promote persistence in STEM. Outreach activities will reach students and teachers, members of the public, and wildlife managers with messages about global change and resilience.

"Strong adherence to underwater or wet surfaces for applications like tissue adhesion and underwater robotics is a significant challenge. This is especially apparent when switchable adhesion is required which demands rapid attachment, high adhesive capacity, and easy release. While organisms like the octopus and mussel excel at underwater adhesion, synthetic adhesives lag far behind, which is due to a fundamental knowledge gap in how chemical, geometric, and material properties interact to control underwater switchable adhesion. This Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) award aims to incorporate mussel-inspired adhesive chemistry with octopus-inspired adhesive structures to rapidly switch adhesion in dry and wet conditions. This will accelerate and build the fundamental knowledge of how chemical, geometric, and material properties control switchable adhesion to transform the design of rapidly switchable adhesives for stiff and soft substrates in wet and dry environments. This new knowledge will advance future economic and societal innovations in critical applications from transient tissue adhesives for prosthetic and wearable sensors to robot-assisted surgery, robotic gripping, and pick-and-place manufacturing. In addition to training and mentoring strong graduate students, the research team will develop bio-inspired adhesive gripping activities to inspire K-12 students to pursue science and engineering careers. This will be complemented by engaging future workforce leaders in adhesion science and engineering through career development panels at national adhesion conferences.

This DMREF award supports research to combine underwater-based dynamic adhesive chemistry with active adhesive geometry to determine how adhesion can be switched underwater. The goal of this work is to provide the fundamental understanding needed to design adhesives with tunable adhesion strength, high adhesion switching ratios, and rapid switching times. This will be achieved by integrating experiments, simulations, and machine learning into a cooperative framework. This research will establish for the first time a design methodology that amplifies the benefits of chemistry and geometry into a single underwater switchable adhesive system. This design methodology will provide opportunities to speed up the switching of dynamic chemistry by releasing the interface with active materials and enhancing the adhesion strength of geometric structures with dynamic adhesive chemistry. In contrast to prior work which has studied how chemistry or geometry independently influences adhesion, this work will uniquely determine how dynamic chemistry and active materials combine to control adhesion, providing new paradigms in adhesive design.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to convert non-food cellulosic corn fiber, a low-value byproduct from corn ethanol plants, to fermentable sugars using a bolt-on catalytic membrane reactor without the need to construct new facilities. The successful completion of the project will enable corn ethanol producers to diversify revenue streams, maximize production efficiencies. The proposed technology operates with higher efficiency than naturally occurring systems and can complete the conversion in less than one day, 5-10 times less than the exiting enzyme technology. The catalyst can be used repeatedly and is environmentally friendly. 

The proposed project relies on a catalytic membrane reactor with a patented enzyme replacement catalyst to simultaneously convert cellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars and separate the hydrolyzed sugars with high yield in one step. This catalyst consists of two adjacent polymeric nanostructures, a polystyrene sulfonic acid and poly (ionic liquid) chains grafted from a membrane support. Two types of grafted polymer chains will act cooperatively to bind and hydrolyze the biomass substrate, similar in nature to the functions of cellulase enzymes. The polystyrene sulfonic acid chain catalyzes the hydrolysis of the polysaccharides to soluble sugars whereas the poly (ionic liquid) chain enhances the catalytic activity and selectivity of the synthesized catalyst. The catalytic activity and selectivity of the designed catalyst can be tuned and optimized by ring substitution and by varying independently the properties of the grafted nanostructures. A porous membrane with an appropriate pore size will enable the separation of monomer sugars immediately after they are released, thus driving the forward reaction, minimizing acid-catalyzed sugar degradation, and improving sugar yields. In addition to fermentable sugars, the catalyst can be tuned to convert cellulosic biomass or other carbohydrates such as agricultural residues or food waste into platform chemicals for the production of bio-based products.

"The goal of this project is to transfer a large research collection of yeasts from Ontario, Canada to UC Davis. Yeasts (single-celled fungi) have great importance for life science research, industry, and natural ecosystems. They serve as degraders, nutrients, mutualists, competitors, parasites & pathogens. These important aspects of yeast ecology were elucidated in recent decades by several key researchers, including Herman Phaff (1913-2001, UC Davis) and Marc-André Lachance (University of Western Ontario). Lachance isolated, characterized, and preserved thousands of yeast strains between 1977 and 2014. He retired in June 2020 and seeks to transfer the collection to a public repository to make them available to the scientific community. Several aspects of this collection make it particularly valuable. It contains 330 type strains including the original type specimens of the 150 species that Lachance described, dozens of undescribed species, and strains that originated from 48 countries. Extensive characterization data was gathered. 5,000 yeast strains comprising the Lachance research collection will be transferred to the Phaff Yeast Culture Collection at the University of California Davis, the fourth largest of its kind in the world, with over 9,000 strains in the public catalog. This transfer will make the Lachance yeasts and associated data available to the research community for the first time, enabling use in a broad range of research fields such as taxonomy, ecology, physiology, comparative and functional genomics, and biogeography. 

Collection maintenance protocols of the Phaff Yeast Culture Collection follow relevant best practice guidelines to ensure the yeast strains meet the needs of the users: they are viable, pure, of the declared species, are backed up remotely, their characterization data are available to the user community, and handling, distribution and use comply with regulatory requirements such as biosafety, biosecurity, and Nagoya Protocol. Yeasts from the Lachance collection will therefore be accessioned into the Phaff collection under the collection’s standard protocols. Specifically, strains will be inventoried then shipped to UC Davis. Strains will be cryopreserved in triplicate: working and backup stocks at UC Davis, and a third copy cryopreserved off-site at the USDA National Laboratory for Genetic Resource Preservation in Fort Collins, Colorado. The viability, purity and species ID of each strain will be validated. Each strain will be identified by ribotyping using next generation sequencing by our collaborator Novozymes, Inc. at their research facility in Davis, CA. Strains that pass quality control criteria will be added to the Phaff collection public catalog and the Global Catalog of Microorganisms. DNA sequences will be deposited in GenBank. In addition to the already databased geographic and host material information, over 40 years of unpublished physiological data (up to 80 descriptors per strain) will be entered into the BioloMICS database and published in the Phaff collection online strain catalog. This multi-step process ensures that Lachance’s yeasts will continue to spark discoveries by future generations.

"The goal of this research is to engineer intelligent biological systems, with advanced security features. From an engineering perspective, an intelligent biological system has three fundamental tenets: (i) the ability to make decisions, (ii) a memory system that is coupled to decision making, and (iii) a means to communicate with other discrete living units. Engineered intelligent biological cells will enable the development of living therapeutics, advanced biomanufacturing capabilities, and contribute to a deeper understanding of complex functions in living systems. In addition, this collection of emerging technologies will enable next-generation biosecurity measures that will prevent the unwanted release of organisms that can cause harm to human life or property, and prevent the theft of valuable biotechnologies. In addition to the above, this research will contribute to workforce development in the areas of protein engineering, genetic engineering, and related technological fields. 

The successful completion of this research will result in several new chassis cells imbued with: (i) engineered programming structures for decision making, (ii) complementary memory structures to control states of specialization, and (iii) biosynthesis and receiver networks capable of programmable unidirectional and bidirectional communication. The resulting chassis cells will enable distributed computation, networked functions, expanded biological computing capabilities, and programmable differentiation. Moreover, the aforementioned technologies will enable the development of a broad range of novel bio-cryptography tools. Collectively this new biosecurity platform will enable scientists and engineers to progress beyond simple operational technology security measures, to a more robust informational technology intrinsic-security approach specifically designed for protecting biotic assets. To achieve these objectives will require the design and construction of novel gene controls forming a system of engineered allosteric transcription factors (i.e., transcriptional programming), a means to program correlated and permanent changes at the genetic level that can persist in forward generations of a given chassis cell, and the development of universal communication processes beyond standard quorum sensing.

"The project will develop a new technique to measure the strength of macromolecular interactions in biology with higher precision than current methods. The new tool consists of a unique combination of using ultrasound to rupture the interactions and fluorescence microscopy for detection of the rupture. For example, one process that will be monitored in unparalleled detail is that of protein synthesis by the ribosome. The ribosome is a complex macromolecular machine that ""reads"" information transcribed from DNA and manufactures its product accordingly.  Yet just how it steps along the ""message"" to read the instructions, and sometime slips out of frame to manufacture an alternate product, are not fully understood. A dynamic picture of the process, combined with what we now know about the structure of the machine, will greatly enhance our understanding how this machine functions, and misfunctions. Further applications to understand how proteins distinguish among cells surfaces to recognize a distinct target are envisioned. The research activities will generate a wealth of training opportunities for graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students. In particular, students in underrepresented groups will be encouraged to participate. In addition, the research will enhance education via the development of a new course at the graduate level that focuses on modern physical, chemical, and biological techniques.

The unique imaging technique, termed as force-modulated fluorescent resonance energy transfer (fmFRET) microscopy, will provide sub-nanometer motion resolution for nucleic acids and sub-piconewton force resolution for non-covalent bonds. The fmFRET technique will integrate the concept of force spectroscopy with FRET detection for the first time: by applying acoustic radiation force with sub-piconewton resolution, the macromolecular interactions will be precisely resolved based on their dissociation forces and detected as fluorescence signal. Because nucleic acid duplexes of different lengths can be resolved by their dissociation forces, this technique will be able to precisely distinguish the positions of nucleic acids in functioning macromolecular complexes with sub-nucleotide resolution, which cannot be achieved by any other techniques. From the point of view of force spectroscopy, fluorescence detection will be faster, more sensitive, and easier to implement than magnetic detection. Furthermore, the new technique will be more precise and robust than optical imaging of microparticles that relies solely on software fitting methods.

Modern humans are longer-lived relative to non-human primates and often remain active at advanced ages. However, the evolution of differences in the biology and timing of aging in humans is not well understood. This doctoral dissertation uses laboratory-based cellular experiments to identify elements of the human genome that act as ‘switches’ to regulate aging. By defining how the genetic sequences of these switches have evolved in humans, the investigators add to the current understanding of human senescence and life history evolution. The focus on cellular aging processes also may inform other basic and clinical research communities. In conjunction with museums and pedagogical centers, the researchers develop exhibits and online learning materials to highlight this research on the evolution of human aging and evolutionary theory more broadly. The project involves the training of undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM, for careers in biological anthropology and related fields.

The observation of elongated lifespan in humans relative to chimpanzees suggests evolutionary differences in the biological mechanisms of aging. One hypothesis is that during the evolution of the genus Homo there may have been deceleration in cellular senescence. In this project, the researchers use the human knee joint as a model system for examining tissue decline and dysfunction. Experiments are performed to generate dysfunctional knee cartilage cells, using next-generation sequencing assays to characterize shifts in cell regulatory networks, both in the expression of proteins and how the genes encoding these proteins are regulated, that define the senescence process. This experimental dataset is then combined with computational genetic analyses to understand the role of human sequence evolution in modifying these networks and the consequences to tissue decline that may have resulted. These publicly-available datasets can serve as an important resource for research in the fields of biological anthropology, aging, gene regulation, and joint biology. Given the dearth of comprehensive datasets for joint tissue cells, particularly in the context of aging and cellular senescence, this research is of potential interest to the biomedical community and those studying age-related joint diseases such as osteoarthritis.

This doctoral dissertation project advances knowledge about the relationship between tooth root shape variation and feeding adaptations in living primates and fossil hominins, to advance knowledge about feeding and diet during human evolution. The project uses methods and works with collaborators from a variety of fields including paleontology, anthropology, anatomy, and primatology, providing integration and cross-disciplinary perspectives for understanding human evolution. The project supports graduate and undergraduate training, including individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM research, and the investigator has developed student and public science outreach activities plans well as contributing to primate conservation efforts. 

Previous work in primatology and paleoanthropology has considered how tooth crown shape affects the efficiency of processing foods during feeding. However, teeth are subject to an equally important, competing functional constraint; while teeth must function to fracture food items, they must also avoid being fractured themselves. This proposal seeks to answer whether: 1) variation in premolar form is mechanically related to resisting tooth fracture during feeding on mechanically resistant foods; and 2) variation in premolar tooth form explains mechanically significant feeding behavior in fossil hominins. The project integrates morphometric and engineering analyses coupled with observational behavioral data to test hypotheses concerning the functional relationships of premolar root form, a character featured in many hypotheses about early hominin phylogeny and adaptation. The project also integrates multiple types of data analysis including biomechanical analyses, three-dimensional shape analyses and primate behavior videographic analyses, ensuring a robust and comprehensive approach. Additionally, methodologies from several fields are incorporated, including biomedical science and engineering, biological anthropology, anatomy, primatology, and evolutionary biology, which provides the potential for collaboration among scientists across these disciplines.

This doctoral dissertation project reconstructs evolutionary relationships among ancient populations of Homo erectus, a pivotal human ancestor, using dental and skeletal data. The project integrates paleontological and population genetics approaches for reconstructing evolutionary history, thereby advancing knowledge about how hominins, including our species, Homo sapiens, evolved. The project promotes interdisciplinarity by using approaches typically used in the field of bioarchaeology, increases diversity in the field of paleoanthropology by supporting the scholarship of a female paleoanthropologist, and fosters international research collaborations. The investigator conducts public and K-12 science outreach through a weblog about human evolution and through science activities with middle and high school students.

Homo erectus, represented in the hominin fossil record, is morphologically diverse through both time and space. The current understanding of how populations of H. erectus were related to each other is limited. Bony and dental anatomy provide the primary basis for assessing evolutionary relationships between populations in the fossil record, but the genetic basis of anatomical traits is not always well understood. This research examines H. erectus temporal and geographic patterns in the relationships among past H. erectus populations using biodistance methods and comparative data. Matrices of dental and neurocranial shape distances will be compared separately using Mantel tests to a matrix describing the temporal, geographic, or genetic distances between populations.

This doctoral dissertation research investigates how group-living primates decide where to sleep at night, and how their choice of where to sleep influences their sleep quality. The project considers how physical features of the environment as well as the differentiated and multi-faceted social relationships that are characteristic of primate group mates impact this important decision. By investigating the consequences of this choice on sleep quality, the research provides a comparative perspective for understanding how early human ancestors survived night predation and obtained sufficient sleep while doing so. This project supports STEM research capacity building at the field site as well as interdisciplinary research opportunities to both undergraduate and graduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM. There are plans to share products of this research with academic and public audiences through scientific manuscripts, public lectures, and popular-science blog contributions. 

Like other savannah-dwelling primates, baboons seek refuge at night in trees and on cliffs to mitigate the risk of nocturnal predation. When choosing a spot in which to sleep within the nighttime refuge, baboons face not only a heterogeneous physical environment that could create asymmetries in the perceived quality of sleep spot alternatives, but also a variable ecological context and dynamic social environment that could further modulate the preferences and availability associated with each sleep spot. Despite substantial research interest, practical limitations have prevented a systematic investigation of how primates navigate this critically important, yet complex decision-making landscape. This project combines traditional field methods in primatology with the latest technological advances to overcome practical limitations, allowing investigators to (1) characterize baboons’ sleep spot preferences; (2) assess how individuals update their sleep spot choices in a dynamic social environment; (3) determine whether acquiring a preferred sleep spot translates to a measurable benefit for sleep; and (4) test how the perceived risk of predation affects sleep spot decision-making dynamics and sleep quality. The project uses methods in field primatology to describe the group's social dynamics, 3D laser scanning to assess metrics of sleep spots, thermal imagery and convolutional neural networks to track baboons' decisions throughout the night, accelerometry to evaluate sleep quality, and predator playbacks to manipulate the perceived risk of predation. By examining these aims using olive baboons, the collaborative and interdisciplinary research informs discussions of how early human ancestors may have made complex decisions when they were most vulnerable.

Throughout human history, many factors have influenced an individual’s mobility and diet, and in many cases, dietary practices have diverged alongside changes in other factors such as social status and belief systems. Using bioarchaeological research methods that combine skeletal analyses with aspects of environment and culture to examine diet and burial style at the population and individual levels, this doctoral dissertation research examines how social reorganization affected a broader community in past human populations. Exploring dietary choices during life and status after death advances knowledge about how food and burial practices relate to and reaffirm social roles. Broader impacts of the project include STEM training of a female graduate student, strengthening of international scientific research collaborations, and dissemination of research to the public.

The project explores the relationship of belief systems and social status to diet, origins, and mobility. The investigators consider these dynamics in conjunction with age, sex, and status for two skeletal samples representing religious elites and non-elite individuals, respectively, from the same community. The research examines whether there are dietary differences based on potential status differences and whether place of origin can be identified for non-local individuals. The project utilizes a combination of biochemical, geospatial, and statistical methods, including four isotopic discriminants (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and strontium), the Bayesian FRUITS mixing model, and geospatial analysis of the study region.

Understanding the role of the natural and cultural environments in early life growth and development is important for advancing knowledge about human biological variation and plasticity. This doctoral dissertation project utilizes a biocultural framework to investigate early life exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which may have longer-term consequences for human physiological function. The investigator is examining the impacts of EDC exposure on infant hormonal profiles, adding to an understanding of global and temporal patterns in exposure to EDCs as well as the sensitivity of the developing endocrine system to EDCs. The project provides training in a STEM field to a female graduate student and involves outreach in a local community. The researcher is also creating informational reports to deliver to stakeholders and is collaborating with local organizations to generate recommendations for policy change based on the results of the study. The project also includes science outreach to middle school students and the general public through various science communication initiatives. 

The primary aim of this study is to quantify the effect of EDC exposure on infant hormonal profiles in different environments. Using a novel, nontargeted metabolomics approach, the investigator is quantifying EDC exposures across three biological matrices and two environmental sampling methods from mother-infant dyads. The investigator is drawing upon theoretical frameworks employed in biocultural research to understand and interpret the impacts of EDC exposure. The project builds on the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease Hypothesis by investigating the sensitivity of the developing endocrine system to EDCs using hormonal and exposure profiles. From an Evolutionary Medicine perspective, the project also addresses whether current sources and levels of EDCs overwhelm evolved defenses to environmental exposures, creating an evolutionary mismatch. Incorporating the concept of Locally Situated Biologies, the project includes collection of qualitative data to contextualize how patterns of exposure to EDCs as well as their health consequences are influenced by aspects of the local context.

"This NSF-BSF project is a collaboration between scientists at the University of Utah, USA and the University of Haifa, Israel. It focuses on analyzing the connection between parasitoid wasps and a symbiotic bacterium named Sodalis. Many insects on our planet have evolved associations with Sodalis bacteria which often produce nutrients or other benefits for their insect hosts, allowing them to persist under conditions in which nutrient availability is sub-optimal.  The parasitoid wasp under study in this project has the most-recently derived Sodalis symbiosis yet discovered in nature. It provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the mechanistic and evolutionary bases of emerging symbiotic relationships using techniques including laboratory insect manipulation, bacterial genetic modification and genome sequencing.  It will yield important insight into a phenomenon known as degenerative evolution, in which symbiotic bacteria (including many pathogens) undergo drastic gene loss in response to confinement in a host.  Notably, the genome of the Sodalis symbiont in this project is undergoing proliferation of parasitic genetic elements called insertion sequence elements, that replicate and insert themselves into bacterial genes, causing extensive disruption and loss of gene functions.  This proliferation will be studied using experimental evolution and genome sequencing.  In addition, it will provide a mechanistic understanding of the process of maternal symbiont transmission.  Broader impacts will focus on the education of middle and high school students in Utah and Haifa, who will learn about the biology and bio-control potential of parasitoids and will engage in the collection of parasitoids from their local environment. 

Insects from many different families, encompassing myriad lifestyles and habitats, maintain long-term associations with symbiotic bacteria of the genus Sodalis. In some cases, these associations are ancient in origin and the resulting Sodalis symbionts demonstrate extensive genome degeneration as a consequence of the isolated and uniform symbiotic lifestyle. Genome degeneration involves accumulation of mutations that inactivate and erode genes evolving under relaxed selection. Inspection of the genomes of nascent symbionts reveal that selfish insertion sequence (IS)-elements play an important role in the process of degeneration. These IS-elements undergo proliferation in the early-stages of host-association, presenting a potent mechanism for inactivation of bacterial genes and yielding repetitive templates for deletogenic recombination events. This project focuses on a nascent Sodalis symbiont that lives in association with a parasitoid wasp, has been cultured in the laboratory and is amenable to genetic manipulation. The mechanistic basis and evolutionary consequences of IS-element proliferation will be studied in vitro and in vivo using experimental evolution. Notably, some IS-elements in this Sodalis symbiont have acquired bacterial genes that likely enable them to silence the transposition of competing elements, facilitating IS-element “war games”. The role of these genes in the proliferation process will be examined via genetic manipulation of the symbionts. Genetic approaches will also be utilized to identify the bacterial determinants of vertical symbiont transmission in this system. Together, these activities will provide important new insight into the early, deterministic stages of genome degeneration, enhancing our understanding of the evolution of mutualistic and pathogenic associations.

"This project aims to serve the national interest by increasing students' opportunities to participate in scientific research. Participating in research to answer a real-world problem is known to increase a student's persistence in STEM. The science of genomics offers rich opportunities for undergraduate research. Technological advances are helping to unlock the genomic sequences of a growing number of organisms, including many that are critically important to the economy, human health, and the natural environment. Genome sequence data is accumulating so fast that the main bottleneck to understanding it is a large scientifically educated workforce to analyze the data. This project will create a network of genome scientists and educators to create opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in scientific research. The emphasis of this network will focus on the genome of the western corn rootworm. The project will provide a matchmaking service to help genome scientists and educators with complementary interests find each other and set up partnerships. The project will provide resources and guidance to help ensure that the course-based undergraduate research experiences produce both a good education experience for the students and reliable data for the scientists.  

This incubator project will set up a network that brings together genome scientists in need of help analyzing their data and instructors seeking research opportunities for their undergraduate students. The project team will implement a series of Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) as modules within existing classes or as standalone classes. CUREs will be implemented at multiple institutions with diverse populations. Student survey data and student work will be analyzed by the leadership team to inform others in the network of evidence-based best practices and to provide guidance for those creating new CUREs. Student work that meets approved standards will be communicated back to the scientific community. For example, manually curated gene models will be submitted to NCBI to improve existing genome annotations. The modest infrastructure requirements needed to implement genomics- based CUREs makes them ideal for extending research opportunities to students at institutions with limited capacity to offer lab-based research experiences. Efforts to grow the network during the incubator phase will place a strong emphasis on recruiting members at 2-year institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions and minority serving institutions to maximize the societal benefits of the network. This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/).

"This project will serve the national interest by facilitating adoptions of a protein-centric course-based undergraduate research by faculty at an array of types of institutions, dramatically increasing the number of students from diverse backgrounds that will experience the benefits of research integrated into their undergraduate education. The U.S. economy in STEM is growing but the workforce for these demanding fields is not keeping pace. In a time when demand for STEM-educated workers is growing, an alarming number of students leave before completing their degrees, and this pattern is especially true for women, first generation students and students of color. One of the ways to retain students in STEM is by engaging them in research. Because the number of traditional undergraduate faculty-mentored research opportunities are limited, it is critical to develop ways to integrate research into the curriculum to broaden access to all students. This project will develop a national network of faculty who study and teach about the same protein. The network will develop and refine a course-based undergraduate research course so that a wide range of students learn about and contribute to our understanding of the protein.   

The integration of research into the teaching environment using course-based undergraduate research experiences (CURE) has significant positive impact on motivation and persistence of STEM students similar to that seen from traditional undergraduate research experiences.  Sustained support and availability of these experiences is critical and best conducted within a network of faculty each working in a common research tread/topic. Missing in STEM is a protein-centric CURE network for a robust and sustainable experience developing biochemistry and molecular biology research skills. This project will grow a network of collaborating life-scientists to integrate biochemistry, cell biology and other disciplines in a protein-centric CURE. To accomplish this goal, the project will: 1) Develop a dynamic training and mentoring program to attract a diverse array of faculty and facilitate their adoption of CUREs using the malate dehydrogenase (MDH) enzyme; 2) Create a regional infrastructure of Hubs to maximize the community benefits that contributed to the success of the MDH CURE community and will contribute to the long-term sustainability of the network; and 3) Develop electronic and physical resources and partnerships to further lower the energy barriers for the MDH CURE adoption and maximize the impact these aims. The project will implement its strategic partnerships with other NSF Funded networks, organizations, and companies to optimize these efforts. When completed a sustained collaborative network of faculty engaging a wide range and number of students in protein CUREs will be in place.

"When integrated with batteries, fuel cells can be used to significantly increase the range of electric vehicles, potentially even making long-haul electric aircraft possible. Most fuel cell technologies, however, rely on hydrogen as the fuel and so the low energy density of compressed hydrogen gas and the large energy input needed to produce cryogenic liquid hydrogen limit every-day transportation applications of this hybrid electrical energy technology. Ethanol, a liquid under ambient conditions, constitutes a renewable and high energy density alternative to hydrogen, albeit with the drawback that the ethanol must be reformed to hydrogen in a complex chemical process before it can be fed to the fuel cell. In this proposal, the ethanol reforming process will be integrated with the fuel cell by developing a catalyst that accomplishes this chemical transformation on one of the fuel cell electrodes, eliminating the costly, heavy, and energy intensive reforming process. The academic researchers developing this direct-feed ethanol fuel cell will partner with Nissan North America, Inc. to advance their e-Bio Fuel-Cell automotive technology. If successful, the outcomes of this project include a total weight/cost reduction of the reformer/fuel cell system and a simplified fuel cell internal design. The proposed research builds on an existing collaboration between Nissan and the academic research team. This GOALI proposal will support this close link between the industrial and academic research teams through a student internship program, introducing graduate students to interdisciplinary research involving material synthesis, catalyst engineering, and fuel cell technology at Nissan, Washington State University (WSU), and Stony Brook University (SBU). The proposed work will have broad impact on (1) research experiences for underrepresented undergraduate students through the Office of Multicultural Student Services at WSU and the Inclusive Education program at SBU; (2) promoting public awareness of the importance of science and engineering by collaborating with the Palouse Discovery Science Center at WSU and the Institute for STEM Education at SBU; and (3) attracting high school students to the fields of science and engineering by mentoring a high school team for regional science events and participating in the ACS Project SEED Program. The results of the proposed research will be disseminated widely through the normal channels of publication and presentation at technical meetings.

In pursuit of practical direct-feed ethanol fuel cells that will enable long-distance electric transportation, the primary aims of this research program are to (1) develop ethanol reforming catalysts in the form of Mo-doped Ni (Ni-Mo) nanoparticles highly dispersed within a three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous BaO-based support that can strongly adsorb and activate H2O as the internal ethanol reforming layer over the conventional Ni-based fuel call anode, and (2) investigate the catalyst performance under conditions expected for transportation applications of direct-feed ethanol metal-supported solid oxide fuel cells (MS-SOFCs). A significant advantage of a direct-feed ethanol MS-SOFC is the simplicity afforded by not having to externally reform the ethanol fuel to hydrogen; however, under the harsh operating conditions of conventional MS-SOFC operation, the Ni-based anodes would quickly deactivate due to severe coking. To address this issue, the academic research team will design the multifunctional bilayer anode by electro-spraying Ni-Mo nanoparticles as the internal reforming layer over the anode surface. To successfully fabricate this bilayer anode, the PIs will first tune the electronic structure of Ni-Mo nanoparticle by controlling the Mo doping level and then infiltrate the nanoparticles into the high surface area, three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.2O3 (BZCY) support. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and environmental transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM) will be used to determine the oxidation state and structure of the Ni-Mo/BZCY catalysts under the nominal ethanol-reforming reaction conditions to relate those measurements to observed catalytic performance. The PIs will also use in-situ Raman and DRIFT spectroscopy to investigate the relationship between catalyst molecular structure and reforming reaction mechanisms. Based on the identified structure-activity relationships, the PIs will fabricate the high-performance Ni-Mo/BZCY internal reforming layer over the MS-SOFC anode and will use an in-situ Raman spectroelectrochemical system to investigate its internal reforming and overall electrochemical activity under actual SOFC operating conditions. Through the proposed Nissan North America, Inc. internship program, graduate students will work with Nissan engineers to evaluate and validate model MS-SOFCs with the internal reforming layer at Nissan under test conditions relevant to the vehicle operation. From these road profile tests, the power quality capability and performance of the direct-feed ethanol MS-SOFCs under a range of driving conditions will be assessed.

"With the support of the Chemical Synthesis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Michael Young of The University of Toledo is developing new ways to install new molecular fragments at both carbon atoms of an alkene by using reaction additives to control the regiochemistry. Alkenes are common feedstock chemicals that are obtained from both petrochemical and bio-based sources. Despite the many existing strategies that have been studied for selectively converting alkene building blocks into value-added products, there are still challenges associated with the formation of product mixtures and the need for wasteful intermediate synthetical steps. Dr. Young and his research team are working to control the reactions of alkenes with simple and abundant reaction additives such as carbon dioxide. These studies have the potential to permit for more efficient syntheses of valuable chemical building blocks for new pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and next generation materials. Dr. Young will also introduce the practice of solvent recycling to research students and into teaching labs to emphasize the importance of sustainability. In addition, online short courses on green chemistry principles are also being developed for students and the local chemical industry workforce.

Directing groups have played an essential role in advancing the field of C-H functionalization and the development of transient directing groups continues to improve the synthetic efficiency of this important strategy for achieving selective reactivity. Dr. Michael Young and his students are developing ways to use transient directing group tools for internal olefin functionalization strategies. Specifically, the regioselective arylation of free amine-tethered alkenes with aryl halides is being investigated by changing reactions conditions. This approach is designed to both improve the selectivity of internal alkene arylation reactions and facilitate product diversification. In addition, 1,2-difunctionalization reactions of activated alkenes will be studied to install C-C and C-O/C-N bonds in the same step. Mechanistic studies are planned to guide optimization and synthetic application of this new chemistry. These activities are expected to provide new approaches to the rapid diversification of amine-containing compounds, which is beneficial for developing compound libraries to support the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. These activities will also provide an excellent training ground in synthetic and organometallic chemistry for a diverse group of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, as well as a postdoctoral researcher.

"Among the many consequences of global warming and other human impacts on the oceans are a general decrease in seawater oxygen concentrations and, in some areas, pronounced expansion of ocean oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) and coastal “dead zones.” The Indian and Pacific Oceans are areas of particularly large OMZs, and coastal waters surrounding densely populated countries in the Indian Ocean are prone to dead zones. OMZ expansion and coastal dead zones threaten marine life, including valuable species for local populations and ecosystem services such as fisheries and tourism. Larger OMZs would also produce more nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Despite this importance, there is no consensus on how these threats will evolve in the future. This CAREER award will use Earth system models (ESMs) to examine the suite of physical, chemical, and biological processes that combine to produce OMZs and dead zones, and study how natural processes and human activities change them. The lead investigator will develop an educational activity on climate change and mitigation at the middle-school level. This activity will guide teachers and students to explore the effects of human activities, and mitigation strategies including thought- provocative mitigation plans such as ""a cyclist planet"". It will be tested with local middle-school teacher and students and shared publicly on a peer-reviewed web platform. 

Numerous studies in the past twenty years have highlighted strong discrepancies in future projections of OMZs. One challenge to refine these projections is that prior mechanistic work generally considered sub-regions of OMZs or the effect of one physical or biological mechanism in isolation. This project will build upon and expand this body of work to provide a comprehensive understanding that connects ventilation pathways and biogeochemical feedbacks to the OMZs at the scale of the Indo-Pacific basin, including largely overlooked key processes such as the Indonesian Throughflow or anthropogenic aerosol deposition (Objectives 1 and 2). This project will harness the state-of-the-art ESM ensemble from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) and novel ocean biophysical models in combination with existing observational constraints with the aim to narrow down future OMZ projections. This project will also assess for the first time the risk of coastal dead zones in the Indian Ocean, using a high-resolution regional bio-physical model that incorporates the wide range of key natural and anthropogenic processes, from local (river discharge, eddies) to global (OMZ expansion, monsoon changes) scales (Objective 3).

"Drought-induced forest die-off is a global phenomenon with far-reaching ecological and economic impacts. In the western US, tree death from drought, high temperatures, and bark beetle outbreaks now exceeds forest growth. Despite increases in the frequency and severity of drought-related insect outbreaks, factors influencing a tree's susceptibility to insect herbivores, such as the presence of chemical defenses, have received little attention. In particular, it is unclear how drought causes trees to shift resources toward or away from the chemical defenses that deter insect attacks and the subsequent trade-offs that exist with other important plant functions. To address this critical knowledge gap, this study focuses on how pinon pine trees allocate their carbon resources toward defense and other physiological processes under increasing drought stress to avoid death by drought or bark beetle attack. This study uses an isotope labeling approach in both greenhouse and field experiments to track drought-induced changes in carbon allocation to specific chemical compounds that affect bark beetle choice and success. The project increases participation of Native American students through undergraduate recruitment for summer research assistantships as well as other underrepresented minorities in science through the development of two critical thinking modules and support for their adoption in rural middle school classrooms across Montana. 

The rate of tree mortality has increased across the globe yet the understanding of the mechanisms underlying tree death remains surprisingly limited. Most work to date on drought-related tree death has focused on understanding the coupled roles of carbon starvation and hydraulic failure, but drought is oftentimes accompanied by insect outbreaks that cause or contribute to tree mortality. Research has yet to determine when trees cease investment in effective chemical defenses against biotic attack along the continuum of drought stress, and how these shifts in carbon availability simultaneously impact other plant physiological processes. This study seeks a mechanistic understanding of how drought stress affects the interactions among tree hydraulic function, carbohydrate availability, and chemical defense. Using both greenhouse experiments and field drought manipulations this research will couple enzyme assays with the use of stable isotopes to identify mechanisms responsible for shifts in pinon pine allocation of recently fixed carbon at the level of individual compounds with known impacts on bark beetle behavior. These methods will also allow identification of trade-offs involved in the synthesis of defense compounds at different drought severities while also advancing fundamental understanding of tree physiology and whole tree C budgets. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the effects of drought-induced physiological stress on mechanisms determining defense against bark beetles, a new, more complete framework for assessing mechanisms of tree mortality will be developed.  This research was co-funded by the Integrated Ecological Physiology Program in IOS/BIO and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation has gained endorsement in recent times for treating limited cancer types, e.g., localized prostate cancer. HIFU procedure is not routinely conducted because its targeting effectiveness remained uncertain when compared to standard treatments for localized cancers. HIFU ablation in presence of direct injection of gold nanoparticles into subcutaneous tumors have shown enhanced ablation due to unique acoustic-thermal phenomenon, while thermal damage in adjacent normal tissues was reduced. However, HIFU ablation with direct gold-nanoparticles injection has yet to achieve its full potential because it primarily treats superficial tumors and that the heterogeneous gold-nanoparticles concentration at the injection site leads to uneven heating profiles. The objective is to achieve the goal of focused ablation at reduced HIFU power levels using functionalized-gold-nanoparticles enhanced energy deposition. The use of HIFU heating of systemically injected gold-nanoparticles for ablating deep-seated cancer could guide future larger-scale animal studies and treatment planning in humans. This unique interdisciplinary study links fields of cancer therapy, nanomaterials, bio-heat transfer, wave propagation, image analysis, and non-invasive surgical method, augmenting ongoing collaborations with US FDA and, in turn, benefiting medical and industry community. Undergraduate/minority students will be actively recruited as in the past.

The long-term goal is to develop HIFU-gold-nanoparticles ablation methods that selectively target and ablate deep-seated tumors. It is hypothesized that systemically injected functionalized-gold-nanoparticles exposed to reduced HIFU power will lead to improved targeting of tumors and enable uniform heat deposition, while minimizing collateral damage to surrounding tissues. To test the hypothesis, animal models with will be used to assess the efficacy by which functionalized gold-nanoparticles injected into the circulation combined with reduced HIFU power will achieve precise targeting and uniform ablation of prostate cancer. Nanotechnology will be used to develop functional gold-nanoparticles that can recognize specific cell-surface markers overexpressed on prostate cancer cells. It is expected that systemically injected functionalized-gold-nanoparticles will selectively target deep-seated cancer; and that they can be used to both image and ablate prostate cancer tissues with minimal collateral damage to adjacent tissues. This pilot research is expected to provide proof-of-principle that cancer tissues can take up multifunctional gold-nanoparticles and can be selectively ablated, thus developing a novel ablation approaches to treat cancer tissues. Such protocol would improve cancer patient care and management of disease.

"Modern real-world applications have created an urgent need for analyzing and interpreting high-dimensional data with low-dimensional structures. In situations where a large number of response variables is present, very few features may be completely irrelevant to the entire set of responses; this leads to ineffective sparsity-based variable selection and to non-interpretable vanilla low-rank modeling. To address these issues, this project proposes grouping the features based on their contributions to the response variables, in a possibly low-dimensional subspace, in order to build a more parsimonious and interpretable model. In the context of multivariate learning, the intrinsic cost of searching for clusters and the potential adverse effect of high-dimensionality on signal recovery are not yet fully understood. Another critical challenge in the big-data era is to develop efficient optimization algorithms with rigorous convergence guarantees. The fact that the obtained algorithmic solutions may not be globally optimal, due to the non-convexity of the problem, makes the statistical error analysis nontrivial. The associated model-selection problem is another unsolved problem in the context of clustering, most notably when the number of features and/or the number of responses go beyond the sample size. To answer these questions, innovative and transformative statistical methods are being introduced, and the proposed algorithms are being analyzed to demonstrate their efficiency. The project covers potential applications in a wide range of areas such as machine learning, genomics, and macro-econometrics, and will help cross-fertilize ideas from statistics, operations research, economics, and bio-engineering. Education activities are tightly coupled with research, and include course development, student mentoring, outreach, and recruiting underrepresented students. 

The project proposes a novel clustered reduced-rank learning framework that utilizes joint matrix regularizations to relax the stringent assumption of sparsity-based learning and to gain interpretability as compared with vanilla low-rank modeling. Some universal information-theoretic limits are revealing the intrinsic cost of searching for clusters regardless of the estimator in use, as well as the benefit of accumulating a large number of response variables in multivariate learning. Efficient optimization algorithm that perform simultaneous subspace learning and clustering are being developed; the resulting fixed-point estimators, while not necessarily globally optimal, still enjoy the desired statistical accuracy beyond the standard likelihood setup. Finally, a new kind of information criterion for joint cluster and rank selection is being proposed, without assuming either infinite sample size or large signal-to-noise ratio. The research is creating a fusion between statistics, information theory, nonconvex optimization, and model selection, with real-world applications.

"Non-Technical Summary. 

Proteins modified with lipids are an emerging class of biomaterials with diverse applications in materials science and healthcare. However, to realize their promise, it is critical to develop a comprehensive understanding of foundational principles governing the formation and properties of these hybrid biomaterials under a range of solution conditions. This collaborative project will integrate experiments and simulations to create a blueprint for the design of nanoparticles with user-defined properties by changing the composition of lipidated proteins and temperature. Machine learning algorithms will be used to iteratively integrate feedback from simulations and experiments and to derive predictive rules that guide the design of nano-biomaterials for specific applications ranging from the delivery of chemotherapeutics to the templated synthesis of nanomaterials. The project leaders also will develop an integrated experimental and computational cohort-based research experience program for students from diverse backgrounds, including women and underrepresented minorities in STEM. Research training at the interface of chemistry, biology, materials science, and physics will enable these trainees to advance the frontiers of knowledge, accelerate materials innovation, and contribute to U.S.’s leadership in the global bioeconomy.

Technical Summary. 

Despite advancements in the past decade, the design of hybrid materials comprising lipid and protein building blocks remains a largely ad hoc process, impeding progress in the field. This limitation arises because the sheer size of the design space of lipid-protein biomaterials prohibits empirical elucidation of design rules. Thus, to efficiently reveal foundational design principles, new approaches that integrate experiments, simulations, and machine learning algorithms are needed. This collaborative project leverages the research team’s complementary expertise in biosynthesis as well as computational and experimental characterization of lipidated proteins. The project will investigate lipid-modified intrinsically disordered protein polymers (Lipo-IDPPs), which combine the hierarchical organization of lipids with temperature-responsive behavior of IDPPs to form nano- and meso-assemblies with temperature-dependent characteristics. Using this model, the team will develop predictive design rules for programming the thermo-response and hierarchical assembly of Lipo-IDPPs in their molecular syntax (the physicochemistry of their building blocks, their primary sequence, topology, and amphiphilic architecture). Two objectives will be pursued, each of which uses a closed-loop strategy of modeling, synthesis, and the characterization of a series of Lipo-IDPPs with precise genetically encoded syntax. Using an integrated approach that judiciously combines iterative feedback from experiments, simulations, and machine learning, the team will: (1) develop a predictive model of Lipo-IDPPs’ thermo-response based on their molecular syntax and (2) identify a macromolecular blueprint for tailoring the structural hierarchy of their assemblies as a function of physiologically relevant temperatures. The material properties of a series of Lipo-IDPPs as a function of temperature will be characterized using multiscale experimental (spectroscopy, scattering, and microscopy) and computational (atomistic and coarse-grained simulations) approaches. Machine learning methods will be used to combine experimental and computational results into a model for mapping molecular attributes to observed material properties. The optimized model will provide insights into the biophysical contribution of different components of molecular syntax to the programmable temperature-responsive assembly of this class of materials and can be used to formulate rigorous and predictive rules for the inverse design of Lipo-IDPPs with desired properties in biologically relevant milieus. Elucidating the design principles governing the multiscale organization of Lipo-IDPPs will enable the rational synthesis of responsive materials with genetically programmable molecular syntax and properties. And the integration of iterative feedback from in silico and experimental characterization techniques with data analytics, which is applicable to other hybrid materials, will accelerate biomaterials’ design and discovery.

"PART 1:   NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY

Electronic biomaterials have been more and more heavily used in/as bioimplants to directly interface with biological systems, inside live human and animal bodies. The resulted devices typically provide unparalleled functions in recording, studying and modulating biological processes and physiological conditions. However, the functional longevity of these materials under bio-implantation is commonly limited by the foreign-body responses elicited by immune systems. The material improvements for solving this problem, though highly desired, have been largely hindered by the lack of fundamental knowledge about the immune behavior at such material-biology interfaces, particularly with the influences from different material structures. In this research, aiming at closing this gap on electronic polymers—an emerging class of electronic material with higher mechanical compatibility with biological systems, Dr. Wang proposes to carry out fundamental biomaterial research on their interaction behaviors with immune-systems, especially at the cellular level. Dr. Wang will create electronic polymers with varied chemical structures, and perform in vitro cell experiments to characterize their interaction behaviors with different types of immune cells and environment during the typical foreign-body response process. This research will provide essential data for understanding the influence of different material design features on immune reaction pathways, and therefore guide the future development of immune-compatible electronic polymers. The research activities will provide learning and training opportunities for students at the interface of polymer science, electrical engineering, and immunology. Supported by this research project, a new program will be established with high schools in Chicago’s south side community to bring both high school teachers and students into the biomaterials research. The research and education results will be disseminated broadly through peer-reviewed publications, seminars, conference presentations, and websites. 

PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY

For bioimplants that directly interface synthetic materials with biological cells and tissues in live biological systems, a long-standing challenge to be resolved is the commonly existing foreign-body responses elicited by immune systems. An emerging and promising direction for solving the immune-compatibility problem for implantable electronics is to use electronic polymers that have better mechanical compatibility with biological tissues. However, progress has been hindered by the lack of understanding and strategies for effectively combining molecular designs for immune-compatibility and electrical conduction on polymeric materials, without sacrificing the other. This research aims to establish the fundamental biomaterial understanding about the interaction behaviors between electronic polymers of varied conjugated backbones and side-chain structures with proteins and different immune cells that make the overall foreign body responses. Specifically, the study will include both commonly used design units for conjugated polymers, and newly incorporated immune-compatible groups for the possible improvement of immune-compatible properties. At the same time, for such new immune-compatible designs of electronic polymers, studies will also be carried out on their structure-property relationships in both electron and ion transport. The outcome of the research can be expected to initiate a new research direction for the field of biomaterials, which focuses on combining high electronic performance and immune compatibility in a single material.  Broadly, this research will make the groundbreaking steps for realizing long-term biocompatible electronic polymers, which will largely benefit the technological areas of implantable electronics for medical diagnosis, disease treatment and biological studies. This interdisciplinary research will provide training opportunities for students at different stages for becoming the future workforce in the emerging area of biomaterials and electronics.

"Plastic products are essential for our daily life and underpin an expanding, multi-trillion-dollar global market across numerous industry sectors. However, the resulting plastic waste presents an emerging threat to environmental health and public safety. Large plastic debris gradually breaks down to nanometer-sized particles in the environment and the long-term effects of these ultrafine plastic particles remain largely unknown. This project supports fundamental research to understand the interactions of nanoplastic particles in the environment with microorganisms, which provide insight into the nanoplastic accumulation in the human food chain. The research team will combine theoretical and computational modeling with cutting edge experimental techniques to discover the relationship between particle shape, cellular entry process, and cell responses. This new knowledge gained at the nano-bio interface will enable the development of a rational hazard and risk assessment framework for nanoplastics. The educational activities of this project will motivate and train a competitive workforce for developing sustainable solutions to the plastic waste problem. The project will provide multidisciplinary and inter-institutional research experiences for graduate and undergraduate students via step-wise progression and highly structured mentoring. The team will create a symposium at professional conferences to stimulate growth of a research network on nanoplastics. The goal of the outreach is to engage local middle and high school students and to enhance the awareness of the global plastic crisis in the broader community.

The goal of this project is to investigate the interactions of novel synthetic models of environmental nanoplastics with green microalgae on the single-cell level as the starting point to understand how they accumulate in the environment and to which there is subsequent human exposure. To address the need for representative surrogates of environmentally released nanoplastics, this research will create polymer-coated nanocrystals with well-defined non-spherical morphologies and surface enhanced fluorescence. A microfluidic platform will be developed for in situ and in vivo experiments of nanoplastic uptake and toxicological responses of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells. The team will apply the membrane elasticity theory and coarse-grained simulation to predict adsorption and internalization of anisotropic nanoparticles by lipid membranes on different length scales. The integration of experimentation and multiscale modeling will allow the testing of key hypotheses that irregular surface morphology influences individual uptake and collective internalization of environmental nanoplastics. The project activities will be accomplished by integrating graduate students through collaborative and structured mentoring, as well as by providing course-based research experiences to undergraduate students, particularly those from groups traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering. The educational component of the project will also support the development of a topical symposium at the ACS Northeast Regional Meetings, a webinar series, and a plastic pollution exhibition at the annual National Engineers Week Community Day to engage broad research and education communities around nanoplastics.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the primary cause of the premature cessation of breastfeeding. Globally, this issue causes 820,000 deaths in children under the age of five and costs the United States over $300 billion in preventable medical costs annually. By creating an infant feeding system designed for seamless and stress-free breast and bottle feeding, with the only nipple that is researched and designed to mimic a mother’s shape, feel, and flow, this project can offer families bottle to breast continuity-reducing latching problems while promoting breastfeeding. In accordance with the market demand found in customer discovery, this project will supply the first bottle to come with tele-health support for the breastfeeding journey and immuno-biome feedback with remote stool sampling and microbiome data driven insights to support families on how to feed their child best during the first three years of life. By combining remote tele-health and immuno-biome testing services, this integrative model improves access to preventative care while providing bio-feedback insights that can save the U.S. economy an additional $10B annually. 

The proposed project addresses the gap in the $114 billion global baby and femtech industry, where 92% of parents who introduce a baby to a bottle are unable to return to breastfeeding for the recommended two years. The majority of women do not continue breastfeeding after 3 months after introducing a bottle when maternity leave ends. In the hospital, preterm infants are invariably exposed to nipples unnaturally fast milk flow, resulting in infant hypoxia, bradycardia, and long term neurological defects. This problem costs hospitals approximately $50 million annually by increasing consultation and length of stay costs. The proposed technology will mimic unique maternal nipple geometry and evolutionary milk flow specifically with regard to dynamic infant suckling pressures. The technical objectives of initial lab testing are to ensure the prototypes closely replicate the mother’s nipple, in terms of shape and volumetric flow rate, the silicone thickness, the media density, and the proprietary, dynamic valve diaphragm. Initial non-inferiority testing will measure if the project reduces latching problems for mothers after discharge, decreases complications for preterm patients, and the daily $3,000 per preterm infant cost to hospitals associated with flow rate of standard nipples in a quarter-long study.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in improving the development of more effective drug treatments (e.g., therapeutics or regenerative medicine approaches) for diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and stroke. This device provides the necessary information to determine, at an early stage in the drug development, if the new product will provide sufficient gain or benefit.  It is expected that this technology will simplify data processing while providing a high quality, cost-effective, and time-efficient approach. This approach will free material resources and personnel that can be devoted to the development of new products. The advantages of this new system will reduce the time for new products to reach the marketplace while helping to provide higher efficacy treatments for cancer and other diseases with less toxic side effects.

This I-Corps project will provide a new in vitro tool with the capability of gathering information on multiple parameters to determine the efficacy and toxicity of new drugs. This technology provides the means for collecting data on cell responses to (bio)chemical and physical stimuli continuously and in real-time. Contrary to many conventional detection methods that rely on collecting data at the end of the experiment (endpoint), this system collects data continuously, providing a dynamic account of cell responses with a reduced number of samples. This technology will also leverage continuous access to cell behavior data to enable the development of a data analytics approach for impedance spectroscopy-type measurements. The development of this research tool into a more automated system will broaden its impact and acceptance not only in the biopharmaceutical industry but also in academic and biomedical environments and the biotechnology industry.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a sustainable coating technology to reduce global food waste and economic losses. Among all foods, fruits and vegetables are the highest categories of losses, with up to 50-60% of produce discarded in landfills. The proposed innovation will provide a desirable and healthy protein-fortified coating for food preservation and upcycle inexpensive food waste materials currently disposed of as landfills.  The coating is washable, edible, and glossy - providing an all-encompassing yet desirable food preservation solution that benefits consumers, sellers, and farmers alike. It extends the post-harvest life of perishable products by reducing maturation, senescence, dehydration, and microbial growth rates. The proposed coating technology will be targeted towards the growing food coating market and will offer significant potential to combat the challenge of food preservation and waste management effectively and simultaneously.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of an eco-friendly and biodegradable protein-based nanocomposite coating that can be applied to the surface of perishable fruits and vegetables of any shape via dip and spray coatings.  Agro-derived proteins such as soy and corn will be modified by sequential chemical interactions using an optimized, bio-based plasticizer, crosslinker, and nanomaterials to fabricate the coating. In the preliminary work, cellulose nanocrystal-reinforced, egg-protein composite coating has significantly extended the shelf life and cosmetic appearance of various fruits, including banana, avocado, strawberry, and papaya. The coating has shown excellent antimicrobial properties and overcomes the significant challenge of simultaneously achieving the lowest oxygen and moisture barrier properties for a natural food coating. This combination of properties will extend the post-harvest life by reducing maturation, senescence, dehydration, and microbial growth rate. Future efforts include further optimizing materials, chemical modifications, scaling mechanisms from a technical perspective, and assessing business feasibility for potential commercialization.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project lies in an innovative antiviral coating to improve personal protective equipment (PPE).  Given the high transmissibility of COVID-19, it is critical to manage contagion though substantive improvements to PPE, especially face masks. The proposed antiviral composition will significantly reduce spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, starting with surgical face masks.  This can help reduction of other surface-based pathogens as well.  

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a formulation that exhibits antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and can be applied to N95 masks without disrupting filtration requirements. To accomplish this, the company proposes to develop fourteen optimized formulations that will be tested on N95 masks using the company’s ultrasonic spray coating technology. Eight formulations that exhibit acceptable spray coating parameters will be tested in viral challenge studies with H1N1 flu virus. The four formulations with highest antiviral activity will be further tested with relevant viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

"The transition to renewable energies requires mining raw materials to develop and sustain these sources of energy. Unfortunately, mining has historically created a legacy of heavy metal contamination all over the world. Heavy metal pollution is a serious global challenge that threatens human life and food security. In recent years, simultaneous clean-up of old, legacy mine sites using phytoremediation and valuable metal production from the harvested plants has generated increased interest in the scientific community. There is further interest in investigating the integration of remediation with the production of bioenergy and other bio-based products for a more sustainable approach to plant-based remediation approaches. This project will foster research collaboration between Colorado School of Mines, Georgia College & State University, and foreign collaborators at the University of Zambia. Each year, a diverse group of four undergraduate and two graduate students will work with US and Zambian mentors to conduct six weeks of international field work on the legacy impacts of mining, phytoremediation, and the integration of phytoremediation with bioenergy production. This project aims to a) provide US students with international research experiences that develop global competence skills and awareness, b) increase knowledge and understanding of simultaneous use of plants for phytoremediation and clean energy production, and c) improve human health and provide alternative sources of energy for Zambians. Participating US students will acquire critical industry and societal skills such as critical thinking, logical reasoning, problem solving, data analysis and interpretation, writing, and presentation of results. In addition, the skills and knowledge acquired by US students will be transferable to the US, where the need for more renewable and clean energies are in high demand. Recruitment efforts will focus on attracting students from underrepresented groups in the Earth and environment science fields to increase their representation. The project will expose students to hands-on multidisciplinary research (i.e. soil science, plant science, mining engineering, environmental engineering, geochemistry) and mentoring from experts in multi-disciplinary fields. The US students will gain knowledge on how responsible extraction of raw material is beneficial and crucial to national economic well-being. Through faculty mentoring, US students will gain high quality international research experience, global awareness and cultural experiences to broaden their world views. The increase in energy sources would help the authorities in Zambia and other developing countries supply clean energy and help meet the ever-increasing demand. 

The technical objective is to identify geochemical and geotechnical parameters that control the effectiveness of integrated phytoremediation and biofuel production. The hypothesis to be tested is that extraction rates and biofuel potential of hyper accumulator native plant species are a function of climate and the natural variation in the composition and geotechnical properties of mine waste dumps. A secondary objective is to investigate the feasibility of rapid, integrated geotechnical and geochemical characterization of mine waste for phytoremediation and biofuel/bioenergy (i.e., bioethanol, biodiesel biogas/CNG and bioelectricity) production at old mine sites. The study aims to rapidly characterize the properties of old mine waste dumps at selected target sites using advanced geotechnical engineering techniques, identify local metallophyte and pseudometallophyte plant species that can colonize sites that have been highly polluted with heavy metals, identify and compare the most efficient local hyperaccumulator plants, and investigate the biofuel/bioenergy potential of the identified hyperaccumulators.  Results from this project will advance knowledge in phytoremediation and the utilization of locally available plants to mitigate adverse health effects of heavy metal pollution while converting biomass to energy, and thereby reducing pressure on fossil fuels and hydroelectricity.

The increase in energy sources would help the authorities in Zambia and other developing countries supply clean energy and help meet the ever-increasing demand. 

The technical objective is to identify geochemical and geotechnical parameters that control the effectiveness of integrated phytoremediation and biofuel production. The hypothesis to be tested is that extraction rates and biofuel potential of hyper accumulator native plant species are a function of climate and the natural variation in the composition and geotechnical properties of mine waste dumps. A secondary objective is to investigate the feasibility of rapid, integrated geotechnical and geochemical characterization of mine waste for phytoremediation and biofuel/bioenergy (i.e., bioethanol, biodiesel biogas/CNG and bioelectricity) production at old mine sites. The study aims to rapidly characterize the properties of old mine waste dumps at selected target sites using advanced geotechnical engineering techniques, identify local metallophyte and pseudometallophyte plant species that can colonize sites that have been highly polluted with heavy metals, identify and compare the most efficient local hyperaccumulator plants, and investigate the biofuel/bioenergy potential of the identified hyperaccumulators.  Results from this project will advance knowledge in phytoremediation and the utilization of locally available plants to mitigate adverse health effects of heavy metal pollution while converting biomass to energy, and thereby reducing pressure on fossil fuels and hydroelectricity.

 Movement is a fundamental aspect of primate life, as it is key to survival, reproduction, adaptation, and evolution. At fine scales, movement affects individual survival and reproduction through its role in foraging behavior, predator avoidance, and mate acquisition, while larger scale movement can influence local adaptations and speciation via its role in dispersal, population connectivity, and gene flow. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how fine and large-scale movement decisions in primates reflect spatial and temporal variability in their environment. The research provides important insight regarding human land use and its effects on primate movement, providing local reforestation practitioners key information to help direct their conservation efforts. Moreover, the project strengthens research infrastructure and contributes to the education and training of students, including individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM, and the general public. 

To evaluate environmental impacts on ruffed lemur multiscale movement, this project has two main objectives: (1) to assess how fine-scale movement varies through time and along an ecological disturbance gradient at four research sites; and (2) to examine how historic and contemporary environmental variation in the broader region explains large-scale movement and dispersal in the species. The investigators quantify fine-scale environmental differences across the disturbance gradient by using botanical surveys, monitoring monthly food availability, and assessing three- dimensional forest structure with drones. Investigators track lemur movement at each site with GPS collars; this information lets investigators identify aspects of forest structure (e.g., tree canopy cover and connectivity) that influence lemur habitat use. Large-scale landcover, land change, and forest structure is quantified with botanical surveys and classification of satellite images. The investigators use population genetic assessments to quantify lemur dispersal patterns throughout the region, followed by landscape genetic techniques to identify which environmental variables drive dispersal patterns in this species. Overall, this project clarifies how environmental variation and habitat change have influenced and continue to influence fine- and large-scale lemur movement and habitat use. Therefore, the insights derived from this project provide foundational information by which to evaluate environmental drivers of primate evolution at multiple levels.

"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will study how mammalian cell migration in confined space is influenced by the hydraulic environment both inside and outside  the cell. Most of the current knowledge on the fluid dynamics in mammalian cell motility has been developed by studying fluid motion alone, or fluid interaction with a single type of structure. This limitation does not consider how the interaction of the fluid and structure affects cell behavior. This project will use mathematical modeling to decipher these coupled effects in confined cell migration. This project is expected to reveal new mechanisms of how hydraulics can actively facilitate confined cell migration. The results will open new avenues of research in the synergistic effect of fluid in biophysical processes such as immune response, wound healing, tissue regeneration, and cancer metastasis. The theoretical strategies are expected to advance modeling techniques in broader areas that involve multi-component coupling and foster creative designs for bio-inspired, water-based systems. Additionally, this project will enhance science and engineering education via developing an interdisciplinary course on cell mechanics in a partially flipped-classroom approach, nurturing future biophysicists through establishing a scaffolded undergraduate research program on the mathematical modeling of cell mechanics, and promoting K-12 interdisciplinary education through outreach programs targeting underrepresented students.

The specific objectives of this project are as follows: (1) identify how the velocity of a migrating cell in a confined channel is affected by the presence of an additional cell at the front, (2) determine the condition when cells utilize unsynchronized nucleus-cell migration mode within confined spaces and quantify the associated energy efficiency, and (3) elucidate the dual role of the nucleus when cells deform into confined spaces from open spaces. Physiology- and continuum mechanics-based mathematical models will be developed to study the objectives. The models will target a few cell type-dependent features such as membrane protein expression levels and at the same time be as generic as possible to inform typical features of confined cell migration. The model results and prediction will be theoretically and experimentally evaluated. The outcomes are projected to have a positive impact by advancing the knowledge of the active roles of hydraulics in confined cell migration and the techniques of modeling strategies.

"This IRES project brings together advances in sensor devices with machine learning and digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms in an international research endeavor that promises to elevate precision in mobile and wearable technologies.  Arizona State University (ASU) faculty and students will collaborate with the Dublin City University (DCU) Insight Center for Data Analytics, which has a synergistic relationship with ASU in several areas including sensors, analytics, machine learning (ML), wearables and Internet of Things (IoT).  ASU brings expertise in flexible sensors, chemical and biosensors, statistical signal processing, bio-informatics, and machine learning. DCU brings expertise in data analytics, human activity monitoring, environmental monitoring, artificial intelligence, sensor analytics and big data analysis.  IRES participating students will spend an immersive six-week summer program at the DCU Insight Center to actively improve their ML and sensor research skills; participants will produce and evaluate sensor analytics, and create algorithms and software for IoT, wearables and mobile health monitoring. Programs and workshops will be established to train IRES participants to skillfully and effectively present their research in international settings. Weekly presentations at the international site and guidance by international mentors will enrich the cohort’s professional experience. Embedding students in the DCU Insight center funded by European Union (EU) and Irish Science Foundation (ISF) grants will provide knowledge on EU and international research practices, ethics, standards and policies.

The goals of this project are to: a) advance the science of integrated design of sensors and machine learning algorithms, b) train and enable a diverse cohort of students to make research contributions in integrated sensing and ML for IoT systems, c) gain knowledge on international policies/standards of deploying AI, big data systems, and sensors, and d) provide experiences that broaden understanding of global practices and career options.  This project is motivated by the fact that inexpensive sensors are required for IoT, mobile health and wearable systems; to achieve the requisite precision, sensor design must be accompanied by corrective ML and SP algorithms.  IRES research therefore focuses on the overlap of new sensor device design and novel ML algorithm development. In terms of ML, one of the key objectives is to develop compact, low power algorithms adequate for integration with sensors and mobile devices. IRES project areas include flexible sensors, sensor information management, efficient deep learning, and big data analysis.  Example research project applications include biomarker detection, big data processing, gait detection, and deep neural nets for sensor and IoT systems. Work will be disseminated via collaborative publications and presentations in international conferences and refereed journals. Industry engagement at the ASU SenSIP and DCU Insight centers will provide ongoing valuable feedback, and annual external evaluation will assess progress and outcomes across all IRES activities.

Crystal nucleation is one of the most ubiquitous processes in nature; it is a phenomenon that also has countless consequences in pharmaceutical, solar energy, and semiconductor manufacturing technologies. Despite its significance, understanding crystal nucleation remains a grand-challenge problem, both for the atomistic-scale spatial resolution required and the widely ranging timescales that are encountered in its analysis. Compounding these challenges, definitive explanations of the fundamental physical mechanisms at work during nucleation continue to elude researchers. Recent advances in computational algorithms and hardware have created new opportunities for devising practical strategies to further the reliability and impact of molecular modeling as an effective tool to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying crystal nucleation. Therefore, the collaborative research group behind this proposal identified the need for developing a critical cyber infrastructure that offers (1) the versatility necessary to model crystal nucleation across different materials and crystallization environments, (2) the computational efficiency required to simulate naturally occurring and industrially relevant crystallization processes, and (3) the scalability needed to bridge the gap between simulation predictions and experimental measurements. In addition to pharmaceutical, energy, and semiconductor applications, such an infrastructure will pave the way for understanding polymer-controlled crystallization and biomineralization, will make it possible to develop new aircraft anti-icing strategies, and will facilitate the design of bio-inspired materials.

This research will bring together academic experts in molecular simulation method development and implementation, aiming to deploy an integrated, large-scale open-source computational suite that enables modeling crystal nucleation under realistic conditions. This package will integrate a cohesive set of advanced computational tools through an implementation and distribution of these methods as individual modules of LAMMPS, which allows large-scale applications to a broad range of nucleation problems with state-of-the-art quantum-accurate potentials. The methodology and software will be validated through (1) examining the role of surface topography on ice nucleation and benchmarking the nucleation efficiency of experimentally identified inorganic ice nucleators, and (2) modeling the nucleation of NaCl and alkaline earth carbonates from aqueous solution. The proposed computational toolkit will enhance current understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of nanoscopic crystal nucleation and subsequent crystal growth, with direct applications in surface engineering, reduction of membrane fouling induced by mineral scaling, inorganic mineralization, and materials synthesis. The products of this research will be made available to the broader scientific community in the form of open-source software. The investigators will engage in outreach efforts by working with high-school students through a Science Olympiad event, EarthDate broadcasts, and Chemistry Club demonstrations. Special efforts will be deployed in areas with a large presence of underserved populations, thus fostering diverse and equitable interest and involvement in STEM disciplines.

"This project will develop advanced microscopy techniques for visualizing many different molecules at the same time within plant cells, thus contributing to understanding of how plants grow, reproduce and interact with disease causing microbes. This investment in developing multiplex microscopy will provide novel plant focused and other non-biomedical applications for the greater scientific community. This project will be leveraged for training scientists at all ranks up to principal investigators. Tomorrow’s scientists will be trained through active participation in the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (DDPSC) NSF-Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program, teaching an advanced imaging short course, recruitment of high school students for imaging projects and participation in a regional internship program for high school students called Students and Teachers As Research Scientists (STARS).  Additionally, the highly successful DDPSC Education and Outreach program will host workshops for teachers and provide interactive mentoring that connects our scientists with nearby schools including Harris Stowe University, a Historically Black College and University. In collaboration with The Bio-Analytic Resource for Plant Biology, this effort will share plant data online, and actively communicate and disseminate newly developed multiplex techniques through the NSF funded Plant Cell Atlas initiative, a community resource with the goal to build an integrated high-resolution molecular map of plant cells. The results from this effort will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications, at scientific meetings, in hands-on/online workshops, training videos and a searchable online database.

One contemporary challenge in biology is to understand how large numbers of diverse molecules are distributed within cells and tissues. To address this, spatial-omics techniques are transforming the way we understand complex organisms. One form, “multiplex” microscopy, has been applied largely for biomedical applications to understand human disease, but is virtually unused in plants.  This project will develop a transformative and versatile pipeline for multiscale plant tissue arrays using multiplex microscopy, probing nucleic acids, proteins and polysaccharides for correlated light, super-resolution and electron microscopy on the same sample, while preserving cell ultrastructure. The multiplex technique will be validated on select plant systems to create high-dimensional multiplex datasets of 1) cellular/cell wall modifications during abscission, 2) protein, mRNA and sRNA localization in anthers during small RNA biogenesis, and 3) host-pathogen interactions at infection sites.

"Understanding and controlling the complex dynamics of liquid droplets that impact and spread over solid surfaces has intrigued scientists for more than a century because of the potential applications these phenomena have in broad areas of technology, including fuel combustion, spray coating, pesticide deposition, and inkjet printing.  However, most research has considered impact and spreading over rigid synthetic surfaces with uniform textures, which is not the case, for example, in most biological systems. As a result, it remains challenging to predict the behaviors and outcomes of droplet impact on soft surfaces, mainly due to the complexity of the dynamic processes that occur at the droplet rim and the three-phase (solid-liquid-air) contact zone. The goal of this EAGER project is to uncover the fundamental mechanisms that govern contact line dynamics on soft substrates. To examine the details of contact line motion, the researchers will use ultrafast transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM). As a powerful and non-destructive tool, TXM will provide unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions by imaging multiphase topography and transport in otherwise opaque media. The outcome of this project will have a broad impact on a variety of fields. New research opportunities from this project will be integrated with educational endeavours involving underrepresented college students and high school students in western Virginia. 

Three-phase contact line dynamics on soft surfaces is a ubiquitous process, and its underlying mechanism is of significant scientific and technological importance. TXM offers unprecedented temporal and spatial resolutions, phase-contrast with the edge-enhancement capability, and ultrahigh and nondestructive penetrability to examine  three-phase contact line dynamics on soft materials. Soft substrates with well-characterized flexibility and elasticity will be fabricated.  Liquid droplet impact dynamics will be examined with TXM. By visualizing contact line topology and tracking its dynamic evolution, droplet interfacial dynamics including elasto-viscous effects, contact line friction and dissipation on soft surfaces will be revealed for complex, mobile, multiphase and soft liquid-solid interfaces. By imaging the air nanobubbles that may be trapped under an advancing contact line, the mechanism of contact line slip may be revealed. The proposed efforts could not only advance our understanding of the underlying physics governing multiphase interfacial transport on soft surfaces, but also open a new avenue to developing novel bio-inspired interfacial materials and provide guidelines on modifying elasto-viscous properties for controlling droplet impact behaviors.

"With the support of the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, and partial co-funding from the Ceramics Program in the Division of Materials Research, Professor Philip Grandinetti and his group at the Ohio State University are developing machine learning tools to improve understanding of the physical and chemical properties of glass-containing materials using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy – the technique upon which Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is based.  Specialty glasses continue to play critical roles in a large range of technological applications, such as glass substrates for handheld electronic device displays and lighting, optical fibers, nuclear waste storage, and bio-glass implants.  These applications have high societal impact across a wide range of environmental, energy, and health-related issues.  A major challenge in tailoring the properties of new glass compositions is the inadequacy of available quantitative details about the structure of glasses, which determines their macroscopic (bulk) properties.  Professor Grandinetti is developing more sensitive methods and open-source software tools that perform a deeper analysis of NMR data and give richer details about structure in glassy materials. The work addresses a range of factors determining glass properties such as dimensional stability, strength, phase separation, hardness, and chemical durability.  It is providing research opportunities for students from underrepresented groups, in part through a partnership with Berea College in Kentucky.  Collaborations provide all students involved in the project with opportunities for interactions with scientists in industry as well as across national boundaries. 

This project focuses on solving the ill-posed problem of inverting an NMR spectrum into its underlying distribution of nuclear interaction parameters, followed by a quantitative mapping of these parameters into structural distributions. In this effort, Professor Philip Grandinetti and his group are developing open-source Python programs, documentation, and tutorials, and associated progressive web apps to enable fast, easy-to-use, and versatile simulations and analyses of experimental one- and higher-dimensional solid-state NMR spectra. They capitalize on their recent discovery that highly selective excitation of quadrupolar nuclei can extend NMR transition lifetimes and provide dramatic sensitivity enhancements.  This advance in turn is expected to enable expanded applications of the statistical learning tools to natural abundance O-17 2D NMR spectra of inorganic oxide materials. Quantification of modifier cation clustering and tetrahedral framework network disorder in a series of alkali and alkaline earth silicate glasses is another aim.

"With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Andrew Greytak of the University of South Carolina will investigate the chemistry at the surface of quantum dots (QDs) in polar solvents such as water to increase their utility in biological applications. QDs are nanometer-scale particles composed of semiconducting compounds, that are typically stabilized in solution by layers of organic molecules attached to their surfaces. QDs often exhibit bright and size-tunable fluorescence that has led to their use in imaging applications, but their utility is limited by unknown governing principles. Dr. Greytak and his group are connecting emerging analytical methods and physical models to chemical reactions that yield water-soluble QDs to better understand these limitations. Broader impacts involve mentorship of graduate and undergraduate students; introduction of new experimental modules into a physical chemistry lab course; coordination of a research and practice showcase with the University of South Carolina Office of Sustainability that provides an opportunity to discuss the role of QDs and other advanced materials in lighting, display, and solar energy applications; and outreach through a local science and engineering fair for junior and senior high school students.

The research employs isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) in combination with NMR techniques to investigate the relative importance of surface coordination and inter-ligand interactions in governing the binding strength and exchange rate of ligands on quantum dots (QDs) in polar solvent environments. In the last few years, the Greytak group has demonstrated that isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) can be an important technique for characterizing QD-ligand interactions, with success in measuring ligand association, ligand exchange, and sequential exchange and binding processes at chalcogenide QD surfaces. This proposal will extend and go beyond these achievements by applying ITC to new classes of nanocrystal reactions in polar solvents, especially those that probe the formation and behavior of water-soluble QDs suitable for bio-imaging applications. Because ITC can distinguish sequential binding to various sites based on differences in their enthalpy of binding, this approach is expected to lead to improved understanding of colloidal QD surface chemistry. Comparisons are to be made among representative small molecule anionic ligands in aqueous buffers. Additional investigations seek to clarify the nature of binding in emerging block copolymer ligands based on imidazoles and analogous heterocyclic.

"Aging is associated with biological, physiological, and functional changes that reflect evolutionary trade-offs in energy allocation across the lifespan. This project uses a non-human primate model to examine age-associated gene expression changes and to investigate the relationship between these changes and age-related phenotypic decline. This doctoral dissertation project advances knowledge about senescence and life history in primates and has the potential to aid in the development of novel life-extending therapies by identifying alterations in organ-specific gene expression that occur across the lifespan, not just in old age. The project supports a female graduate student in laboratory, bioinformatic, and statistical training. She also serves as an educator through her continued involvement in high school programs that provide students from underserved communities with mentoring and research opportunities.

Life history theory posits that evolved trade-offs between early-life growth and reproduction and later-life somatic maintenance are responsible for the timing of life history events. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these evolved trade-offs are not fully understood. Cellular senescence and the proteins secreted by senescent cells (the senescence associated secretory phenotype, SASP) are predicted to be responsible for modulating these life history trade-offs on a molecular level. This project tests the hypothesis that SASP factor expression changes with age and is associated with aging phenotypes in non-human primates. The investigator will generate cross-sectional, tissue-specific transcriptomic data that will be used to characterize changes in SASP expression with age, sex, and tissue type. The researchers will then calculate measures of age-related phenotypic decline to evaluate whether changes in SASP expression are associated with aging phenotypes.

"Among the most popular insects are the hawk moths, well known for their remarkably long proboscises and ability to feed from flowers with extraordinarily long nectar tubes containing nectar of variable viscosity, from watery to sticky. To understand the wide-ranging abilities of these moths to acquire fluid from long and short nectar tubes, a diverse team of researchers will investigate the structure, function, and biomechanics of the proboscis and its associated sucking pump. The team will focus on how wettability of the proboscis and it ability to take up fluid enable the many species of hawk moths to feed on a wide range of liquid resources and from flowers with different nectar-tube lengths. By coupling structural and functional characteristics of the proboscises with principles of biology and fluid dynamics, the team will provide insights into the diversification of hawk moths and their coevolution with the different species of flowering plants from which they acquire nectar and, in turn, pollinate. The results will provide strategies for novel bio-inspired engineering designs and products, such as new microfluidic probes. The resulting tools, techniques, and theories will be mutually beneficial for biological and engineering sciences and will involve integrated biological and engineering education of a new generation of scientists and teachers. In addition, the researchers will participate in public outreach activities related to the project, and students will lead citizen-science activities that provide hawk moth specimens for study and share results on a student-created webpage.

This project focuses on how proboscis structure in hawk moths relates to biomechanics of feeding and explores the evolutionary forces responsible for miniaturization and gigantism of the proboscis. More than 1460 species of hawk moths have evolved to exploit diverse fluid resources. Their proboscis ranges in length from a fraction of body length to more than twice body length, allowing hawk moths to feed from many species of flowering plants. The morphological structure of the tubular proboscis facilitates passive, spontaneous fluid uptake. The principal hypothesis is that structural variations of the proboscis and sucking pump provide physical determinants for diverse fluid-flow scenarios that enable hawk moths to use many liquid resources of different viscosities. Coupling morphology and wetting and transport properties of proboscises with biomechanics and energetics of fluid uptake will provide physical clues to the evolution and diversification of hawk moths. The objectives are to investigate (1) proboscis structure in relation to wettability, (2) influence of permeability and proboscis geometry on fluid uptake, (3) sucking-pump morphology as a basis for fluid-mechanics modeling, and (4) evolution of physico-chemical traits and the constraints imposed by physical determinants of fluid flow.

"Animals such as cheetahs are often thought of as the exemplars of fast movement, when in fact small animals such as arthropods like trap-jaw ants, click beetles, and mantis shrimps can achieve accelerations six orders of magnitudes more than a cheetah. The overall goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant is to develop analytical and experimental tools to evaluate the dynamics of organisms capable of extreme accelerations and applying these principles towards designing a jumping micro-scale robot, using click beetles as a case study organism. Click beetles belong to a group of organisms that use latches and springs to amplify their muscle power output and circumvent the same actuation limitations that currently cripple micro-robots. The current state of the art in modeling such organisms lack the proper dynamic considerations that would allow engineers to implement the appropriate principles to engineered systems. The techniques developed in this project are beneficial to both biology and engineering. The modeling approach creates a framework to analyze a diverse group of organisms that use springs and latches to move extremely fast. These bioinspired principles enable a design framework for micro-robots to direct power towards the robot’s components for locomotion and dissipate energy elsewhere to prevent mechanical failure. The bioinspired nature of this research makes it an excellent candidate for outreach. Outreach activities include workshops and summer camps for first-generation undergraduates and low income and unrepresented high and middle school students to encourage them to pursue higher education, especially in STEM-related fields. 

This work will advance the fundamental knowledge of the dynamics of ultra-fast locomotion in biology and bio-inspired systems. Most of the literature studying these locomotion strategies in biological systems focus on observing the kinematics only or use overly simplified models for the dynamics. The modeling approach, namely mobility power flow provides insights into how an organism uses and augments muscle power output and how it transmits and dissipates this power for agile locomotion while mitigating damage. In the planned modeling approach, click beetles or micro-robots are represented as a global structure composed of substructures on elastic and rigid substrates to model various environments. Expressions for power transmission and dissipation through each substructure and at the junctions will be studied through mechanical mobility functions, which can be derived analytically or measured directly in experiments. The models and experimentation techniques will create a new pathway to study and design ultra-fast and small dynamic systems.

"Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are soil fungi that associate with plant roots and improve resource uptake of the majority of plant species, including most crop plants. They also impact plant defenses and build soil quality. The functioning of AM fungi varies tremendously between species and isolates. As a result, studies of AM fungi can improve management of agriculture, grasslands and forests. Progress in understanding the importance and optimal management of AM fungi depends upon tests of AM fungi cultures. Unfortunately, few researchers have the expertise or facilities necessary to develop or maintain their own AM fungal cultures, and therefore the availability of cultures can limit scientific progress. This project will enable the study of this important group of soil fungi through support of a culture collection called the International culture collection of (Vesicular) Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (INVAM).  This is the largest culture collection of this type of fungi in the world and includes hundreds of individual isolates.  This collection will enable advancement of knowledge on AM fungal biology, genetics, ecology, and taxonomy, as well as applications of AM fungi for commercial purposes. This project will also promote the exploration of science by the private sector and by students of all ages and abilities. The project will develop modules on experimentation using INVAM cultures that support the K-12 Next Generation Life Science Standards. Standards related to plant growth, soil health and the importance of biodiversity can all be supported by the collection.

INVAM has been the largest provider of cultures to the scientific community and has been the primary resource for identification of AM fungal species. INVAM maintains the largest number of reference cultures, cultures that are linked to a library of voucher specimens and to species descriptions. These reference cultures are a critical resource for the development and testing of new approaches to environmental sequencing, a potentially powerful method to study patterns of AM fungi in the field. The project will maximize the value of the reference cultures through sequencing efforts. The core mission of INVAM is to preserve accessions and provide living cultures to the user community. INVAM also provides comprehensive information on collection protocols and policies, methodology, taxonomy, and a searchable database for accessions and active/stored cultures via the INVAM website. Users include teachers and students from high schools through graduate programs at universities, researchers, and industry clients. Stocks include representatives of 95 AM fungal species, and high value germ plasm including strains used for genome projects and strains known to be highly effective as mycorrhizal symbionts. Dr. Joseph Morton, who built and curated INVAM since 1990, retired in 2017. This project secures the future of the INVAM collections by moving it to the University of Kansas.  The move occurs in phases through the duration of the project to ensure culture viability.

"Drought-induced forest die-off is a global phenomenon with far-reaching ecological and economic impacts. In the western US, tree death from drought, high temperatures, and bark beetle outbreaks now exceeds forest growth. Despite increases in the frequency and severity of drought-related insect outbreaks, factors influencing a tree's susceptibility to insect herbivores, such as the presence of chemical defenses, have received little attention. In particular, it is unclear how drought causes trees to shift resources toward or away from the chemical defenses that deter insect attacks and the subsequent trade-offs that exist with other important plant functions. To address this critical knowledge gap, this study focuses on how pinon pine trees allocate their carbon resources toward defense and other physiological processes under increasing drought stress to avoid death by drought or bark beetle attack. This study uses an isotope labeling approach in both greenhouse and field experiments to track drought-induced changes in carbon allocation to specific chemical compounds that affect bark beetle choice and success. The project increases participation of Native American students through undergraduate recruitment for summer research assistantships as well as other underrepresented minorities in science through the development of two critical thinking modules and support for their adoption in rural middle school classrooms across Montana. 

The rate of tree mortality has increased across the globe yet the understanding of the mechanisms underlying tree death remains surprisingly limited. Most work to date on drought-related tree death has focused on understanding the coupled roles of carbon starvation and hydraulic failure, but drought is oftentimes accompanied by insect outbreaks that cause or contribute to tree mortality. Research has yet to determine when trees cease investment in effective chemical defenses against biotic attack along the continuum of drought stress, and how these shifts in carbon availability simultaneously impact other plant physiological processes. This study seeks a mechanistic understanding of how drought stress affects the interactions among tree hydraulic function, carbohydrate availability, and chemical defense. Using both greenhouse experiments and field drought manipulations this research will couple enzyme assays with the use of stable isotopes to identify mechanisms responsible for shifts in pinon pine allocation of recently fixed carbon at the level of individual compounds with known impacts on bark beetle behavior. These methods will also allow identification of trade-offs involved in the synthesis of defense compounds at different drought severities while also advancing fundamental understanding of tree physiology and whole tree C budgets. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the effects of drought-induced physiological stress on mechanisms determining defense against bark beetles, a new, more complete framework for assessing mechanisms of tree mortality will be developed.  This research was co-funded by the Integrated Ecological Physiology Program in IOS/BIO and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"During hominin evolution, the transition to upright posture and bipedal locomotion was associated with many anatomical changes. This doctoral dissertation research project examines an understudied aspect of inner ear anatomy that contributes to our sense of balance during movement. The investigator compares aspects of inner ear anatomy for humans, primates, and fossil hominins, and examines its relationship with head and neck posture and cranial anatomy. Results from this project advance our understanding of how anatomical structures associated with balance changed with the transition to bipedalism during hominin evolution and may allow for better reconstructions of postural behavior from fossil specimens. The project also contributes to medical treatment by providing insights into the potential for vestibular dysregulation in humans and creating a quantifiable and reproducible visualization of vestibular anatomy that aids precise surgical targeting and development of vestibular prostheses. During the course of the project the investigator will incorporate 3D printed models, illustrations, and animations of the results into public outreach programs in New York City designed to teach human evolutionary concepts to the public. These include programs at the American Museum of Natural History; undergraduate courses at Lehman College; and an undergraduate seminar on the use of multimedia and interactive design in science education.

The vestibular system consists of the semicircular canals (detecting angular acceleration) and the otolith organs (detecting linear acceleration and head tilt relative to gravity) housed within the bony vestibule of the inner ear. In contrast to considerable study of the semicircular canals in primates, the comparative functional morphology of the otolith organs is largely unknown. This knowledge gap has limited our understanding of the evolution of primate, and more specifically human, head and neck posture (head positioning and range of motion). This project uses both Micro-Computed Tomography and Synchrotron Resonance Phase Contrast Imaging to create a morphometric model of the encasing bony morphology (bony vestibule) specific to otolith organ geometry in order to investigate the evolution and functional morphology of the bony vestibule in humans, primates, and fossil hominins. The investigator examines modern human bony vestibule variation and function, consider correlations between bony vestibule morphology and head position and anatomy in a comparative primate sample, and compare modern human and reconstructed fossil hominin bony vestibule features. The research clarifies how the vestibular system and head and neck posture changed alongside one another throughout human evolution and allow future study into the way(s) bony vestibule morphology is correlated with extant primate and reconstructed hominin postural behaviors.

"High efficiency is a fundamental design goal of vehicles moving through both air and water.  Although most human designs of propulsors such as wings or propellers are rigid, natural propulsors are generally flexible. Propulsive efficiencies of natural flyers and swimmers are typically higher than human-designed vehicles of similar weight and dimensions. However, attempts to emulate flexible animal designs have met with limited success. Recent comparative animal studies have demonstrated startlingly consistent patterns of bending kinematics among a broad diversity of swimmers and flyers constructed from very different materials and of very different physical dimensions. These patterns encompass cilia to whale flukes and fluid regimes from water to air. This project will use computational fluid dynamics and particle image velocimetry to measure fluid velocities to investigate the mechanical and fluid dynamic details that enable high force production by flexible natural propulsors.  K-12 outreach activities are planned at the universities and at the Cabrillo Aquarium in San Pedro, CA and undergraduate and graduate student involvement is core to the research project. 

The goal of this project is to develop a set of design rules that govern force production by flexible propulsors. To achieve this goal, experiments and computations will be used to investigate: a) bending kinematics of propulsors as control surfaces of vorticity, pressure fields and thrust, b) the hydrodynamic basis of vortex-vortex interactions that generate pressure fields and thrust and c) the advantageous limits of bending kinematics. Each of these will be investigated using a combination of experiments (particle image velocimetry) with natural organisms and computational fluid dynamic models. The results of this project will define the necessary design criteria that enable performance enhancement by bending propulsors of different types and across a range of fluid regimes. While contributing to interpretation of the natural world, the results will also contribute to novel engineered designs ranging from biomedical applications (cilia) to vehicle design (swimming, flight).

"Millions of people were displaced due to slave trade during the 15th – 19th centuries. These systems profoundly influenced population dynamics as enslaved people were transported thousands of miles from their homes and experienced restricted social life and mobility in enslavement. This doctoral dissertation project examines skeletal morphology of these enslaved people and their descendants to understand how certain biological groups formed and changed over time, explores gene flow and other evolutionary processes that may explain how the biological variation is distributed, and investigates patterns of biological relatedness that may not be reflected in historic migration data. The project supports the doctoral training of a student from an underrepresented group in science, a multi-point research collaboration, outreach with community members, and student mentoring. The project also develops curricula and seminars in collaboration with the University of Florida’s College Reach Out Program to increase postsecondary admission and completion for students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM research. 

This project’s theoretical framework is rooted in stochastic microevolutionary expectations and diaspora studies. Microevolutionary processes such as population stratification are inferred from the premise that gene flow, rather than natural selection, is the main influence on observed biological patterns. Further, interpretations gleaned from the project derive from slave trade history, where European nations directly influenced the gene flow of the diaspora populations that formed across the Atlantic. The project asks two central questions: (1) What African and Afro-descendant diaspora groups show high biological relatedness as estimated by cranial morphology, and how do these data identify evidence of gene flow not otherwise described by historical migration data? and, (2) Given the social and legal restrictions that created physical separation among enslaved persons, do diaspora groups show stronger evidence of population stratification and genetic isolation than African groups? To investigate these questions, this project applies geometric morphometric methods to collect 3D landmarks from adult human cranial remains and uses these data to statistically analyze within-group and between-group variation in cranial morphology. Data will be collected from twenty-one sites, comprising cranial remains of 805 adult African descendants. These samples represent a variety of regions.

"Mineral weathering replenishes the supply of inorganic nutrients that sustains terrestrial life on Earth. The soil microbiome, including fungal communities, contributes to weathering by disrupting, dissolving, and extracting nutrients from mineral grains. Fungi seek out nutrients and water sources by spreading networks of exploratory hyphae across a soil landscape. However, identifying the mechanisms used by fungi to transform minerals to extract rock-derived nutrients remains challenging, especially in natural soils that span different climates, rock types, and ecosystems. The goal of the research is to understand how fungi interact with abiotic environments to initiate mineral weathering and form soil in Earth’s critical zone. This project will utilize recent advances in high resolution microscopy and mass spectrometry to examine fungi interacting with mineral surfaces at micro-to nano-scale resolutions. The results will demonstrate how new technologies can promote the progress of the earth and environmental sciences in combination with an Integrated Critical Zone Model. The project findings will bring economic and societal benefits with respect to soil preservation, agricultural activity, and bio-engineering given the ubiquitous nature of soil fungi in the environment. This research will be integrated with the educational goal to diversify, recruit, and retain community college students in the (geo)sciences academic pipeline by implementing: Soils & Outreach for Integrated Learning & Self-Efficacy (SOILS) Bridge. The bridge program will enhance academic and social resources for incoming college students through tiered mentoring, training in the field and lab, and K-12 outreach. 

This work will probe into fungal-mineral interactions across spatial scales to answer unresolved questions related to fungal impact on mineral transformations and contributions to nutrient cycling. The research objectives are to: 1) Assess weathering of natural soils and incipient transformation of mineral substrates buried in mesh bags across landscapes that span bioclimatic (desert to coastal rainforest) and topographic (summit to drainage) gradients, 2) Differentiate weathering agents and the initial stages of fungal-driven weathering in field systems using microscopy, mass spectrometry, and elemental analyses of deployed minerals, and 3) Quantify mass transfer rates of mineral elements normalized to mineral-fungi contact areas determined from field-deployed mineral samples and subsequently upscaled using soil process models.  The study will provide unprecedented insight into how fungi respond to climate, topography, and nutrient availability and will offer mechanistic insights into processes that upregulate weathering in natural soils.

"Most people think about learning, problem-solving, tool-use, navigation, and communication when considering animal intelligence. However, this view of intelligence is shifting. Increasingly, researchers recognize that merely interacting with the environment requires animals to solve very complex problems. Many of these problems turn out to be more challenging to solve than what is classically defined as intelligent behavior. For example, consider an insect walking across uneven, unpredictable terrain. Coordinating the movement of six legs is a challenging problem. Interacting with the environment is difficult because the animal does not have complete knowledge about its body or the terrain. Nor does it have much time to gather information. This lack of information is common when animals interact with the world. Currently, we do not have a good idea of how animals deal with this lack of knowledge. Bats are ideal animals in which to study this problem. Their sonar system provides them only with limited information about their surroundings. Despite this, they perform astoundingly coordinated and intelligent behavior. The current project investigates strategies echolocating bats use to overcome the lack of sensory information. The aim is to use robots to model several bat behaviors under conditions where the lack of sensory information is the most severe, for example, during the emergence from caves. Using robots instead of computer simulations allows mimicking the sonar signals received by bats faithfully. By examining strategies bats can use to deal with informational deficiencies, the project aims at understanding how animals more generally can overcome this problem.


Animal intelligence is often typified by abilities such as learning, problem-solving, tool use, and other facets of higher-order cognition. However, more recent views on animal intelligence emphasize the ability to adjust behavior to the moment-to-moment contingencies arising in interaction with the physical environment. Coping with the dynamic, unpredictable world is challenging. Most importantly, because action and perception have to proceed in the face of substantial informational deficiency. While acting, animals do not have complete knowledge about the world or their bodies. This project proposes and tests strategies for dealing with informational constraints by building bio-robotic models of bat sonar behavior, allowing for veracious mimicking of sonar signals. In particular, it is proposed that direct mapping of task-specific sensory input to action is a fundamental principle for dealing with informational constraints. Echolocating bats are ideal for understanding animal intelligence under informational constraints because their sonar system only provides limited information about the environment. Nevertheless, echolocating bats perform astounding intelligent behavior in interaction with complex environments. Understanding principles for intelligent sensorimotor control might help to understand the so-called higher cognitive functions in animals. These are not discontinuous with sensorimotor behavior. Indeed, understanding the fundamental principles of animal intelligence (and potentially human intelligence) may require learning about their sensorimotor control origins. As a result, investigating the principles supporting vertebrate sensorimotor intelligence might help explain functions more classically associated with intelligence (e.g., tool use and planning). As such, this proposal aims at contributing to a deeper understanding of animal intelligence and cognition.

"Nontechnical Description:

Oyster reefs are one of the most dominant factors for keeping coastal environments healthy.  These cemented structures, often kilometers long, absorb storm surge energy, filter water, and hold silt in place.  Recent insights are showing that oysters construct their reef communities with a specialized adhesive (or “cement”) whose composition is markedly different from all commercial and other biological adhesives.  Given its unique composition and its ability to work in wet environments, oyster cement presents a different and largely unexplored view on what adhesives can be.  Efforts planned for the current project will help to understand the nature of oyster cement and how this technology may be applied to create unique, new adhesives.  Such information will be adapted here to test the ability of new cements to bond bone, which has a somewhat analogous composition and has been difficult to adhere strongly.  The interdisciplinary nature of these efforts will help to advance several fields including marine biology, biochemistry, and materials engineering.  Outreach activities include working with high school students for laboratory modules in the Women in Engineering Program at Purdue University. 

Technical Description:

Oyster reefs are one of the most dominant factors for keeping coastal environments healthy.  These cemented structures, often kilometers long, absorb storm surge energy, filter water, and hold silt in place.  Recent insights are showing that oysters construct their reef communities with an adhesive (or “cement”) that is predominantly made of inorganic calcium carbonate and a minority of protein.  Such a composition stands in stark contrast to all commercial and other biological adhesives, which are made from organic polymers, polysaccharides, or proteins.  Experiments described herein begin by identifying the proteins of oyster cement (Aim #1A).  Expression of the identified proteins (Aim #1B) will then be used to make protein-inorganic formulations for understanding how the interplay between organics and inorganics generates adhesion (Aim #2).  These structure-function studies will help to illustrate how a material with such inorganic content can exhibit high strength adhesion.  This knowledge will then be used to test a hypothesis stating that bonding of bone may be achieved with adhesives that are hard and predominantly inorganic (Aim #3).  Outreach activities include working with high school students for laboratory modules in the Women in Engineering Program at Purdue University.  Taken together, this work will show how biology creates unique materials and guide the adaption of marine biological technologies to biomedical needs.

"Part 1: Non-technical description 
The goal of all LTER sites is to conduct policy-relevant ecosystem research for questions that require tens of years of data and cover large geographical areas. The Palmer Antarctica Long Term Ecological Research (PAL-LTER) site has been in operation since 1990 and has been studying how the marine ecosystem west of the Antarctica Peninsula (WAP) is responding to a climate that is changing as rapidly as any place on the Earth. The study is evaluating how warming conditions and decreased ice cover leading to extended periods of open water are affecting many aspects of ecosystem function. The team is using combined cutting-edge approaches including yearly ship-based research cruises, small-boat weekly sampling, autonomous vehicles, animal biologging, oceanographic floats and seafloor moorings, manipulative lab-based process studies and modeling to evaluate both seasonal and annual ecosystem responses. These combined approaches are allowing for the study the ecosystem changes at scales needed to assess both short-term and long-term drivers. The study region also includes submarine canyons that are special regions of enhanced biological activity within the WAP. This research program is paired with a comprehensive education and outreach program promoting the global significance of Antarctic science and research. In addition to training for graduate and undergraduate students, they are using newly-developed Polar Literacy Principles as a foundation in a virtual schoolyard program that shares polar instructional materials and provides learning opportunities for K-12 educators. The PAL-LTER team is also leveraging the development of Out of School Time materials for afterschool and summer camp programs, sharing Palmer LTER-specific teaching materials with University, Museum, and 4-H Special Interest Club partners.

Part 2: Technical description
Polar ecosystems are among the most rapidly changing on Earth. The Palmer LTER (PAL-LTER) program builds on three decades of coordinated research along the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) to gain new mechanistic and predictive understanding of ecosystem changes in response to disturbances spanning long-term decadal (‘press’) drivers and changes due to higher-frequency (‘pulse’) drivers, such as large storms and extreme seasonal anomaly in sea ice cover. The influence of major natural climate modes that modulate variations in sea ice, weather, and oceanographic conditions to drive changes in ecosystem structure and function (e.g., El Niño Southern Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode) are being studied at multiple time scales –from diel, seasonal, interannual, to decadal intervals, and space scales–from hemispheric to global scale investigated by remote sensing, the regional scales. Specifically, the team is evaluating how variability of physical properties (such as vertical and  alongshore connectivity processes) interact to modulate biogeochemical cycling and community ecology in the WAP region.  The study is providing an evaluation of ecosystem resilience and ecological responses to long-term “press-pulse” drivers and a decadal-level reversal in sea ice coverage. This program is providing fundamental understanding of population and biogeochemical responses for a marine ecosystem experiencing profound change.

"Pharmaceutical development has a large impact on the nation’s economy and public health. Despite substantial annual outlays for pharmaceutical development, many drugs fail in clinical trial, while the majority of those making it to market fail to yield a profit. These costs and low returns hinder additional development. The Center for Secured Computation for Drug Discovery and Repurposing (SCDDR), through the pursuit of its research thrusts, has the potential to greatly enhance the national research infrastructure by increasing the capacity of the engineering/scientific workforce. In particular, SCDDR will produce new methodologies and infrastructure for industry-wide collaborative drug discovery, yielding new medicines at reduced cost.

The Center will focus on three main areas of unmet/underserved research needs within the (bio)pharmaceutical sector, with the goal of significantly accelerating the pace of drug discovery while reducing research costs: 1) the development, testing, and validation of machine learning methods for drug discovery and repurposing; 2) providing an industry-wide and vendor-agnostic Secure Data Hub for pharmaceutical and patient data with third-party private search capabilities; and 3) enable federated machine learning for drug repositioning over encrypted databases. Enabling these research thrusts are new developments in efficient fully homomorphic encryption and applications of coupled tensor-matrix and tensor-tensor completion methods to drug discovery and repurposing.

This project brings together data scientists, mathematicians, biomedical researchers, and healthcare providers to produce reproducible methodologies that will make a broad impact on drug discovery and biomedical applications of data science. SCCDR will build a world-class data science community that is inclusive and promotes diversity at all stages of the academic pipeline. The Center will support programs to educate the next generation of data science workforce members, research leaders, and citizens. By forming collaborations with industry, government, and community partners, the project will enable the dissemination and translation of research into impactful products and services for the betterment of society.

A single Center-wide project repository, including published results, presentations, developed code, and educational materials, will be maintained and disseminated through the Center website – https://midas.umich.edu/scddr/.

Proposal: 1454300 

This proposal aims at establishing a novel paradigm for astrocytes, which are classically regarded as non-neuronal cells, forming only a support network for neurons. However, recent studies have provided evidence that astrocytes are involved in data processing in the cortex by regulating the neural response magnitude and duration. Furthermore, they appear to have an intermediary role in neurovascular coupling and the signaling pathways that mediate functional hyperemia are regulated by astrocytes. The PI proposes to establish a new platform technology to selectively manipulate neuronal/astrocytic activity and simultaneously record cellular/hemodynamic signals.

The PI has established track records in mentoring students and participating in outreach programs. The opportunities for training and teaching of undergraduate and graduate as well as making impact on undergraduate summer research program and K-12 outreach programs are excellent at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. The applicant has provided detailed plans for the development teaching materials and courses that he plans to develop as well as how he plans to mentor and train undergraduate and graduate students. The proposed outreach program is also well developed. The applicant provides clear plan for how he plans to evaluate each component of the proposed teaching and outreach program.

The PI will combine optogenetics for modulation of cellular activity of neurons and astrocytes with spectral-domain coherence tomography to monitor hemodynamic signals, and two-photon microscopy to observe cellular activity. Since both cellular activity and hemodynamics will be triggered by means of optogenetic modulation, their correlation permits conclusions about the roles of both, astrocytes and neurons. The optogenetic and microscopy experiments will be complemented by a novel electrophysiology platform that the PI has recently developed for optogenetic electrocorticography (ECoG) experiments. Electrophysiological recording of calcium waves will permit a comparison of astrocyte activity and neuronal activity.

"Slender structures are vital to our lives – from columns and beams that support buildings, to airplane wings and blood vessels.  By understanding how they respond to strain and the factors that give rise to bending and buckling, engineers can design safer and more efficient systems with applications in robotics, civil engineering, and medical treatment. Many systems with slender structures exhibit complex behavior that is non-linear and counter intuitive. This Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering  (CDS&E) project combines machine learning and physics-based modeling to better understand their behavior and how to harness it to provide new capabilities.  The findings will enable new structures such as soft robots with new forms of motion and control for medical procedures or search and rescue activities. The knowledge gained may also enable the design of products such as stretchable electronics for health care, bio sensing and a broad range of consumer and industrial products. The project will develop a website and software repository to share the simulation tools with the research community. Educational materials including instructional videos will be developed for graduate courses and K-12 classes.

This project will enable the design of new materials and structures like soft kirigami composites and compressive buckling-induced micro-sized 3D architecture materials. The researchers will advance numerical modeling of systems with slender structures through a combination of machine learning and discrete differential geometry, using “nonlinear springs” represented by neural networks to simulate the systems.  The enhanced computational speed of this approach will aid in the design and optimization of engineering systems such as deployable structures and soft robots. Developing predictive models for slender structures and metamaterials is challenging because of the inherent instabilities and many possible configurations. If successful, this development would be the first of its kind in the mechanics research community and would provide the twin capability to predict complex structural responses and design structures with an inverse problem solver. While the target proof-of-concept examples relate to slender structures and metamaterials, the computational methods would be generalizable to a broad class of material-structure systems.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the reduction in single use plastics that contribute to landfill waste and ocean plastic pollution by replacing these plastics in packaging with a fully biodegradable and naturally sourced alternative. Increasing consumer demand for more sustainable solutions as well as the rapid growth of ecommerce shipping has created an urgent industry need for companies to replace traditional materials with sustainable packaging. This project develops a bio-benign foam that can be produced at scale with drop-in compatible manufacturing processes to create superior biodegradable packaging products at similar cost to traditional expanded polystyrene products.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will scale the production processes of a chitin-based foam to be used as protective packaging. Chitin is a polysaccharide derived from shrimp shell waste. The project fully develop a scalable extrusion process that creates high quality foam and is well-suited to scale for mass production at volumes required to service the packaging industry. With this project, the extrusion process developed can be implemented with supply chain partners to show a fully scalable sustainable packaging material that can meet the increasing demands of the industry. The goals are to achieve high volume production with partners and create protective packaging with the same mechanical performance and density as expanded polystyrene.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research Phase I project is to use waste to produce clean, green energy. The proposed technology diverts waste material from landfills while sequestering carbon and can be used in many other industries such as food waste, forestry biomass and disaster relief.  For example, wildfires are becoming an annual threat that destroys large portions of states and thousands of homes. The proposed technology can reduce wildfire risk by cleaning up the forest undergrowth. Landfills in many states will be reaching maximum capacity in coming years and are under threat of being shut down: diverting landfill waste to the production of valuable products is much desired. Besides municipal waste, it is also possible to reduce the burning of agricultural waste by converting these waste streams into valuable outputs, such as biofuels and biochar for use in applications including concrete and water filtration. A significant amount of carbon is sequestered in this process which can earn additional carbon credits to the operator.

The proposed project will develop a low-pressure hydrothermal liquefaction Inclined Rotary Gasifier (IRG). The project will optimize its outputs to further clean up the liquid & gas product streams from heavy metal contaminants such as Cu, Pb, Hg, Ni, Zn, and Cd, and high concentrations of other contaminants. Phase I research will focus on developing the process to remove up to 90% of the original concentration of these contaminants without compromising the syngas energy content. This will require maximizing the biochar production rate. These rates are typically lower than those when biomass is used as a feedstock. Hence a detailed investigation into the system's thermal efficiency will be undertaken with an aim to increase it. This may require increasing the heat transfer rates through design modifications and the choice of operating conditions. The bio-oil and water (from the high-pressure dewatering system) will also be cleaned by the biochar produced by the same municipal solid waste feedstock.

"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will develop bio-inspired models and experimental approaches for soft materials used in biomedical devices, such as silicone implants, that in operation require the outer surface of the device to slide against living cells and tissues.  Some current designs may induce inflammation by unintentionally increasing friction, with some aggressively-textured soft implants linked to cases of chronic inflammation and even cancers.  This project investigates the dynamics of soft material interfaces guided by the hypothesis that sliding surfaces in nature reduce friction through a delicate balance of fracturing and rapidly re-healing crosslinks between macromolecules in aqueous solutions.  This work will develop biomedically-relevant material systems of different polymer network density and structure, with the long-term goal of creating low-friction interfaces for soft biomedical devices.  This project will train undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary research across biology, engineering, mechanics, and physics. These research efforts will be strengthened by engaging students from underrepresented groups through high school outreach activities, including hands-on demonstrations and workshops for local science teachers, undergraduate research opportunities in partnership with minority-serving institutions, and diversity-focused scientific seminars for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.

These research efforts address a gap in knowledge and understanding of lubricity in soft aqueous gels and biotribology using engineering tools with molecular specificity, materials characterization techniques, and custom-built instrumentation. The specific research objectives are: (1) develop new models of aqueous gel networks that fracture whilst retaining low shear, (2) synthesize new materials and surface architectures based on hydrogels and weak, self-healing crosslinks to test these hypotheses with in situ experiments, and (3) develop reliable, responsive, and resilient biotribological interfaces for multifunctional purposes and (4) design responsible biodegradable materials by exploring degradation properties and behavior for sustainability purposes. Establishing and demonstrating the utility of fragile interfaces to provide robust protection and lubricity will extend the study of the mechano-dynamics of fragile interfaces into new fields from biology to chemistry, and medicine using solid mechanics tools.

Nontechnical summary

Electron microscopes take beautiful and informative pictures of metal particles of nanometer size, but the images can sometimes be difficult to interpret.  The chemically-complex metallic-alloy nanoparticles (CCA-NPs) that motivate this work are of great interest in a wide range of applications including catalysis, energy conversion and storage, and bio/plasmonic imaging.  This research project develops a multi-disciplinary modeling methodology supported by experimental measurements to keep pace with the growing widespread application of atomically resolved microscopic measurements.  The main objective of this project is to utilize a novel modeling framework based on machine learning to extract information about atomic column heights and chemical elements from experimental high-resolution electron microscopy images of CCA-NPs of different compositions and sizes.  Although the present work is motivated primarily by nanoparticles, the framework is general and easily extendable to other nanoscience research amenable to scanning transmission electron microscopy, such as catalysis, crystallography, and phase evolution.

The team will introduce in their undergraduate and graduate courses a number of topics related to the present project, stressing familiarity with current research problems and direct experience with different computational methods as well as open source and commercial software.  The investigators and their group members actively participate in outreach activities for local high-school women and members of underrepresented groups through the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) Open House and the UIC Youth Program.  The computer simulation results with narratives will be used for classroom teaching and will also be made available to the public and scientific community via microblogging and social-network services.


Technical summary

The latest developments in machine and deep-learning algorithms, coupled with continuing progress of in-situ electron-microscopy techniques, have paved the way to an effective analysis of a variety of materials.  This research uses a deep-learning model built on a fully convolutional neural network to resolve the elemental distribution of CCA-NPs represented in atomic-resolution transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy images.  The objective of the proposed neural network is to learn, through semantic segmentation, the non-linear correlations between the pixel intensities of microscopy images and the number of atoms of different constituent elements in the atomic columns of CCA-NP structures.  In spite of the critical need in determining structures and elemental distributions, current experimental efforts rely on trial-and-error analysis and often involve many assumptions.  This is due to the nonlinearity and complexity of TEM images, preventing the straightforward estimation of atomic column heights and elemental distributions.  Thus, the main objective of this project is to provide such information from experimental high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and scanning TEM (STEM) images of CCA-NPs of different sizes and compositions, including high-entropy alloys (HEAs).  An integrated, multi-disciplinary modeling framework based on machine learning (ML), an evolutionary approach (EA), and density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations supported by HRTEM and STEM measurements is proposed.  A supporting objective is to provide a range of experimental conditions for which reliable HRTEM images may be acquired.  This project provides a paradigm shift in the analysis and interpretation of HRTEM/STEM experimentally acquired images of CCA-NPs employing a multi-disciplinary modeling approach through (i) advancing the current state of the art of deep-learning techniques for evaluation of experimentally obtained images, (ii) generation of physically meaningful and reliable training data for CCA-NPs using the Wulff Construction, (iii) evaluation of elemental motifs in HEAs using an evolutionary approach, and (iv) more profound understanding of the influence of the microscope parameters (e.g., dose, focal spread, defocus, etc.) on the quality of neural-network predictions.

"This project will investigate on-skin interfaces, an emerging, next generation form of wearable computing. On-skin interfaces come in forms such as smart tattoos and bandages. They expand the sensing capabilities of current mobile and wearable devices by facilitating direct access to signals that represent people’s physiology. This technology holds promise for realizing the vision of an ""invisible computer"" for pervasive healthcare, elderly assisted living, the future of work, and national defense.  While prior on-skin interfaces have suggested benefits to society, the difficulty of prototyping on-skin interfaces is limiting progress in this nascent, yet potentially transformative field. The project will advance the prototyping, design, and use of on-skin interfaces through the development of toolkits that combine traditional crafting methods and unorthodox materials, with digital fabrication techniques and electronics. It will incorporate diverse perspectives, outside of laboratory settings, for the design of social interactions, form factors, and applications. It will bring scientists, engineers, and artists together to invent the future of human experiences of on-skin technologies. The investigation will introduce young girls and rural area youth to interdisciplinary STEM learning through on-skin interface workshops using the developed toolkits. Novel collaborative programs with craftspeople and artists, and teaching innovation at the graduate and undergraduate level will contribute to educating new STEM workers, who combine on-body design with emerging miniaturized technology. 

This project will hybridize digital and physical realms, connect cultural and technological materials, and blend craft, computing, and electronics. It will investigate innovative wearable computing through these research aims: (1) construction toolkits that enable populations previously without access to electronics development to prototype on-skin interface applications; (2) novel fabrication processes that blend readily accessible textile and paper materials with emerging slim electronics for rapid prototyping of on-skin interfaces; and (3) novel programs for transdisciplinary collaboration between STEM researchers and craftspeople. The research aims will be evaluated through (1) wearability and durability studies of the developed tools; and (2) workshop studies that provide novel assessments of how diverse populations build on-skin interfaces, including how they approach the process, the type of applications they want to build, how they envision the technologies integrated in everyday life, and the STEM-related skills they develop through the making process.

"As the nose is responsible for heating and humidifying air before it enters the lungs, geographically-patterned variation in nasal morphology has long been attributed to climatic adaptation. However, previous research has also shown that the nose must be large enough to take in a sufficient amount of oxygen during each breath to meet life-sustaining metabolic requirements. Accordingly, this doctoral dissertation project examines the combined effects (and possible functional trade-offs) of demands for respiratory air-conditioning and oxygen intake on the nasal complex during human evolution. By explicitly investigating climatic adaptation in nasal morphology within the context of human body size and shape, this study helps address how different anatomical systems have co-evolved in response to environmental pressures. Computed tomography (CT) scans generated for this project will be made freely available to other researchers through established online archives, substantially expanding the geographic/temporal diversity of CT scans currently available to anthropologists and the broader scientific community. This research also provides training opportunities for undergraduate and medical students (including those from under-represented groups) and the investigator will incorporate project findings into ongoing public outreach initiatives including K-12 science education programs, museum-based community engagement, public lectures, and online podcasts.

Despite substantial evidence that both climatic and metabolic pressures have likely influenced human nasal anatomy, the interplay of these two factors on nasal size and shape during human evolution is not fully understood. This study employs a ""whole-body"" approach by quantifying variation in cranial and post-cranial skeletal morphology in a large, geographically- and temporally-diverse sample of recent and fossil Homo. Using established equations, body mass and basal metabolic rate will then be calculated from post-cranial measurements and employed in conjunction with nasal and climatic variables to statistically assess whether: (1) nasal morphology exhibits stronger associations with metabolic demands than other aspects of the craniofacial complex; (2) climate and metabolic demands differentially influence particular aspects of nasal morphology; and (3) deviations from climatically predicated nasal morphology in fossil Homo (particularly Neanderthals) are attributable to greater energetic requirements.

"Biological adaptations are often observed to have evolved multiple times within a group of species. This phenomenon may be related to the occurrence of particular co-occurring traits within a group of species that make the evolution of some adaptations more likely than others. Among primate groups that use suspensory locomotion, this pattern of movement seems to have evolved multiple times independently. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how covariation among biological traits within the forelimbs of primates affected the trajectory of their evolution. The project contributes to an emerging understanding of how covariation of traits impacts the evolution of new body plans, in particular the evolution of humans’ distinct form of upright walking. In addition to training a graduate student, this project generates a large dataset that can be used to train undergraduate and high school students in study design, statistics, and computer coding. The doctoral student plans to publish short, public-oriented video abstracts of this project’s results, creating a direct link between active scientists and the public.

This project studies how changes in the way biological traits covary can affect the trajectory of evolution, potentially making specific adaptive suites more common in certain clades while inhibiting their evolution in other groups. The investigator plans to collect 3-dimensional data on the forelimb bones of primates from across the order, use evolutionarily informed statistics to identify traits that are associated with frequent suspensory behaviors, and examine how these traits covary in suspensory taxa and their close relatives using matrices. Different hypotheses about the evolution of suspension in primates predict different strengths and patterns of trait covariation in suspensory vs non-suspensory groups. The extent to which the common ancestors of humans, chimpanzees, and other apes were adapted for suspension is under active debate. By studying how suspension evolved in primates, this study will contribute to our understanding of early human evolution.

"Human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) show promise for treating deadly incurable diseases. One of the main limitations of hMSC production is the growth of fully functional cells in bioreactors. Treatment with interferon gamma (IFN) enhances the therapeutic potency of hMSCs but also inhibits growth. Coating hMSCs with layers of collagen (COL) and heparin (HEP) reduces the inhibition while maintaining the therapeutic enhancement, but it is unknown how the layers cause this to occur. This project will identify the specific pathways by which COL/HEP coatings enhance hMSC response to IFN. This knowledge will support the design of optimal bioreactor platforms for the manufacturing of highly therapeutic cells. Students from underrepresented populations will engage in research at the interface between engineering and biology. This will help develop a  strong and diverse biomanufacturing workforce.

The central hypothesis of this project is that COL/HEP coatings work synergistically with soluble IFN to modulate signaling pathways regulating proliferation and immunosuppressive properties. This hypothesis was formulated, in large part, based on preliminary data indicating that COL/HEP coatings: induce expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) and reduce the anti-proliferative effect of IFN while enhancing immunomodulatory cytokine secretion. The specific objectives are: (1) To establish the relationship between the coatings and the activation of the FGF2 pathway in hMSCs, and its relation to proliferation; (2) To establish the mechanism by which IFN activates hMSCs cultured on COL/HEP coatings; and (3) To determine the extent to which COL/HEP coatings remain consistent when translated to microcarriers for suspension-based bioreactors. This project will directly impact the cell manufacturing field by merging polymeric materials with biochemical signals to produce a technology that enhances hMSCs activation and therapeutic potency.

This project is jointly funded by the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"In animal species, a variety of social and physiological cues are thought to convey information about an individual’s health, status, rank, or reproductive fitness to other individuals. Many primate species, for example, rely on social cues about status and rank of other group members to gauge competitiveness and mate quality, which requires the ability to keep track of multiple individuals. However, there may be an upper limit to how many individuals can be recognized. In this doctoral dissertation project, the investigator studies a primate species with very large group sizes to examine whether male chest patch coloration may replace social knowledge of rank as a signal of male competitive ability. The project directly engages with evolutionary theories about trade-offs between social and morphological indicators of reproductive fitness, specifically advancing knowledge about the social and ecological environments that favor the evolution of costly visual signals (like chest coloration) relative to social knowledge as a means to appraise fighting ability of competitors. While conducting the proposed research, the investigator continues her involvement in local public science engagement to help foster an interest in science among young students of all backgrounds, improve science literacy in her local community, and promote open science communication to build trust between researchers and the public. 

The colored patch on the chest of male geladas has been hypothesized to be the product of sexual selection -- a quality signal to ward off would-be rival males. This research empirically tests the relationship between the intensity of male chest color, physiology, and reproductive fitness in a wild population of geladas. The investigators first examine what might cause red chests at a mechanistic level by analyzing color-gauged photographs taken from individually-known adult males to determine if male redness is associated with testosterone levels and/or gene expression related to vascularization and blood flow in the local tissue. At a functional level, the investigators then use demographic data paired with individual male redness to determine whether redder chests are associated with a longer reproductive tenure for those males, and whether this contributes to more offspring in the long-term, as determined by paternity testing of all infants.

"Interconnected food-energy-water (FEW) demands are increasing due to increasing population and economic growth. One of the major reasons for these increased demands is the generation of non-utilized waste streams. The U.S. generates approximately 254 million tons of trash each year, with only 34% of this waste recycled or composted.  Increasing restrictions on the export of garbage has generated both challenges and opportunities for the management of waste systems. Waste material provides and opportunity for materials recovery, the generation of new products and processes, and the potential to positively impact food, energy, and water systems.  Given the increasing rates of consumption internationally, developing the next generation of waste recovery is of global significance.  However, reinventing waste streams requires a better understanding of how waste is currently governed, rethinking and redesigning waste recovery production systems to better capture the value of material, developing systems for monitoring material composition, integration with new cyber infrastructure for waste monitoring, and incorporating the behavioral and policy structures that influence action across complex multi-scaled systems.  The objectives of the project are to develop a systems-level framework for comparative analysis of organic waste lifecycles that combines behavior sciences with material flows analysis to rethink waste systems and the development of new co-products from organic wastes. 

This proposal focuses on systems-level interactions in the framework of ""Organic Waste Lifecycles at the Interface of Food, Energy and Water Systems (OWL-FEWs)."" The project entails the development of the next generation of cyber-infrastructure for measuring, monitoring, and capturing data on organic waste streams; analysis of social and institutional drivers behind organic waste disposal behavior; and experimentation, development, and testing of new co-products from organic waste streams. Utilizing an existing pilot-scale anaerobic digester, bio/hydrochar engineering facilities, open source radio frequency identification tagging for real time tracking of waste flows, and a series of behavior experiments and comparative institutional analysis of human behavior, the research team will focus on five goals: 1) The development of a dynamic model of organic waste lifecycles at a regional level; 2) The development and testing of organic food waste co-products for energy, soil amendments, water remediation, and other uses; 3) The development of a smart organic food waste cyber infrastructure; 4) The integration of social sciences across the development of the dynamic model, cyberinfrastructure, and waste/resource products; and 5) The engagement of stakeholders across the research and educational efforts. The results of this research will provide meaningful pathways to reducing waste in the U.S. and provide water treatment, energy, and agricultural resources from waste, leading to better food, energy, and water security in the U.S.

"Natural history collections document life on earth, past and present, and represent an invaluable and irreplaceable resource for the study of biodiversity. Proper and long-term management of natural history collections, including both physical specimens and their associated data, is crucial for scientific research by contemporary and future researchers. The Collection of Fishes at Texas A&M University is a substantial university-based ichthyology collection that has experienced rapid growth over the last 20 years. This collection serves a dual research and teaching role on the Texas A&M campus and more regionally, acting as both reference collection and specimen repository for researchers at other universities in Texas and other southern US states. A major goal of this project is a collection-wide physical re-organization and re-curation of specimens, coupled with a database platform migration that will safeguard the physical and digital content of this collection, facilitate growth, and broadly improve capacity to serve the national and international ichthyological research community as well as a growing community of non-traditional users of specimen data (e.g., K-12 educators, artists). Goals also include training of undergraduate students and Texas Master Naturalist volunteers in natural history specimen curation and management, novel undergraduate student course assignments and K-12 science-based art workshops focused on vertebrate natural history and ichthyology, and development of a temporary public exhibit showcasing the rare specimens from this university-based collection.    

The project will involve installation of new shelving and metal tanks to facilitate wholesale reorganization and re-curation of current alcohol specimens in the Collection of Fishes at Texas A&M University and to generate ample space for future growth.  A globally unique collection of oversized (10–14ft) shark specimens will be secured through container updates, specifically the replacement of a 40 year old custom-made oak casket with an industry standard air-tight metal unit.  Finally, data management platform upgrades will improve basic digital data management and enhance real time availability of specimen records via online international archives, including through iDigBio.org and VertNet.org.  Completion of these tasks will rejuvenate infrastructure available for fundamental ichthyological education, unique research, and discovery at Texas A&M University and globally.

"Natural history collections record the world’s diversity through time and support the scientific community’s understanding of changing ecosystem dynamics. In the face of declining insect biodiversity worldwide, it is more important now than ever for entomology collections to preserve, digitize, and disseminate specimen data to the broader community. The Frost Entomological Museum at Penn State cares for more than 1.3 million specimens that span the diversity of insects. This collection stands to grow further, through the incorporation of satellite collections of pollinators, especially bees (more than 125,000 specimens), and through the activities of the Insect Biodiversity Center (IBC), a recently established research initiative at Penn State. The infrastructure provided through this grant increases the storage capacity of the Frost by 50%, allowing for the curation of these collections and to serve as a repository for scaled up efforts to understand insect diversity through time. The award also provides the resources to digitize the substantial aphid collection (approximately 224,000 specimens on 49,000 slides), which holds important data regarding these insects’ plant hosts, and aquatic insects (approximately 100,000 specimens in 15,000 vials), which are indicators of habitat health. These improvements will facilitate research that addresses native pollinator decline, epidemiology, global climate change and its impact on species distributions and invasive species, niche restrictions, indicator species, and the evolutionary history of insects. The project will also generate data that contribute to ongoing research on imperiled insects and will fill critical taxonomic, geographical, and temporal gaps in existing datasets.

A high-density compactor storage system will be installed in the Frost Museum in order to accommodate new rows of cabinets for pinned insects. These cabinets will accommodate approximately 1,600 drawers of expanded space. A portion of this storage will be utilized by incorporating the pollinator collection previously housed at Penn State’s Fruit Research and Extension Center and specimens generated by Penn State’s Center for Pollinator Research. The aphid collection, which consists of slide-mounted specimens, will be imaged on a flatbed scanner and then moved to new custom-built slide cabinets. The slide scans will be transcribed in the Frost Museum database, georeferenced, and the data shared with iDigBio and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The aquatic insect collection likewise will be imaged and rehoused in new, expanded ethanol storage. The lot images will be transcribed, georeferenced, and the data shared with the above repositories, making them accessible to the public. A graduate student and at least two undergraduates will receive training in collections care, management, and digitization.

"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY

Perhaps the most intriguing aspect in looking to structures within the cell to inspire the next generation of novel materials is not their bulk structural properties but the cellular ability to “reprogram” these structures. Much as reprogramming software allows it to perform different tasks, reprogramming materials allows them to take on novel functions after production. This is especially evident in select proteins that phase separate into protein-rich and protein-dilute liquid phases, much as oil added to water will separate into an oil-rich liquid phase. This phase separation has been shown to be controlled by phosphorylation, or the addition of a charged phosphate group to the protein. Not all phosphorylations are created equal; phosphorylation at certain sites within the protein will eliminate the ability to phase separate while others still can control the transport of molecules in-and-out of the protein-rich liquid phase. However, the inability to simultaneously assess the sequence of phosphorylation (or “phosphorylation code”) and the corresponding materials properties of the protein-rich liquid phase in the cell has made it difficult to design synthetic materials that offer similar reprogramming capability. 

This project seeks to overcome this obstacle by using novel biochemical engineering techniques to manufacture proteins with specific phosphorylation codes and subsequently measure the materials properties of these phase separating-proteins. In doing so, a framework will be created to design other materials with similar reprogramming capabilities and potentially generate a new class of biomimetic materials for therapeutic and consumer use. Beyond that, given the multidisciplinary scientific and engineering requirements, this project will not only provide training opportunities for the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists but seek to expand that pipeline by providing research opportunities for students at local community colleges in the greater Los Angeles area. 

TECHNICAL SUMMARY

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) persist as biopolymers in solution and can undergo phase separation into protein-rich liquid droplets, akin to polymer coacervation. These subcellular structures serve unique purposes, ranging from organelle sequestration to potentially behaving as bio-reactors within the cell. However, biology has built in an additional layer of sophistication; IDPs can be “reprogrammed” via post-translational modifications to alter the materials properties, enabling a range of dynamic properties that would be impractical with well-folded proteins.

One particular modification, phosphorylation (or the addition of a divalently-charged phosphate group), has been shown to independently control the phase behavior and biomacromolecule transport properties of synapsin, an IDP that forms synapsin-rich liquid droplets within the neuron. While control of these properties is an inviting target for biomaterials investigation, deciphering the “phosphorylation code” of modifications that can occur at multiple, distinct sites and correlating these codes to their resultant biological function remains a challenging obstacle. To overcome this barrier, insights from polymer science and physical chemistry will be used to target specific phosphorylation codes most likely to alter materials properties. Then, cell-free protein synthesis strategies will be used to express and purify synapsin with specific phosphorylation codes and measure their resultant biomaterials properties. Ultimately, this data will form the basis of a design framework that has explanatory and predictive power for reprogramming other IDP-based biomaterials and even synthetic polymer systems.

"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY

The tendency of proteins in water to adhere randomly to nearby surfaces is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature. This phenomenon, known as “fouling,” is usually considered a confounding problem which can lead to a wide range of issues, such as clinical failure of biomedical implants and undesirable attachment of marine organisms to ship hulls. However, this project aims to leverage the persistence of protein fouling as the basis of a new, highly versatile approach for creating multifunctional surfaces. Using silk fibroins, a class of biocompatible proteins derived from or inspired by the main component of natural silk, this project will develop methods for creating robust nanometer-thin coatings on a variety of surfaces without requiring hazardous chemicals or complex instrumentation. Towards this goal, the project will seek to gain a fundamental understanding of the fouling behavior of silk fibroins as they undergo self-assembly – an aggregation process which underlies the spinning of silk threads by insects and spiders. Through a combination of synthetic biology and surface-sensitive material characterization techniques, this project will also reveal fundamental insights about how proteins and other biomacromolecules in nature are able to adhere tenaciously to surfaces without specific chemical reactions. Furthermore, this project will develop a bio-inspired strategy by which the function of surfaces, such as biocompatibility or therapeutic activity, can be modified for applications in human healthcare and sustainability. To facilitate the dissemination of complex scientific findings from this project to a global public audience, the Merian Studio for Visual Communication will be founded at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. This technology-equipped workspace will enable students to produce compelling visual educational tools, such as 2D/3D graphics and animations. As part of this visual communication effort, the project will also support an interdisciplinary team of art and engineering students to create an interactive video game that intuitively teaches the fundamental concepts of natural protein assembly and fouling phenomena.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY

This proposal aims to develop a powerful bottom-up strategy for creating multifunctional thin-film coatings that leverages the unique self-assembly behavior of silk fibroins at solid-liquid interfaces. Such interfacial behavior, where adsorption occurs concurrently with protein-protein assembly, is a type of robust “fouling” which has not been sufficiently studied to date, despite being an important aspect underlying natural biomacromolecular adhesion. Furthermore, whereas fouling of surfaces by proteins has long been considered an undesirable but unavoidable problem, interfacial silk fibroin self-assembly can be used as a versatile non-covalent approach for modifying a variety of surfaces under mild, biocompatible conditions without complex chemistries or advanced instrumentation. This project will seek to gain a fundamental understanding of the growth of adherent and defect-free coatings via interfacial protein self-assembly by 1) relating silk fibroin adsorption on high and low surface energy substrates to tunable solution-phase assembly phenomena, 2) determining the role of protein sequence and size on coating formation using de novo designed recombinant silk fibroins, 3) visualizing the effects of nanoscale substrate topography on coating formation, and 4) exploring co-assembly of enzymes and growth factors with silk fibroins as a one-pot method for creating therapeutically active surfaces. The project will generate a comprehensive model for interfacial assembly of network-forming proteins, such as silk fibroins, in terms of protein-protein and protein-surface interactions. Moreover, this work will establish a new non-covalent approach towards functionalizing surfaces for a variety of materials applications. To facilitate the dissemination of complex scientific findings from the proposed research to a broad lay audience, the project will establish the “Merian Studio for Visual Communication” at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, which will be a technology-equipped workspace enabling students to produce compelling visual educational tools, such as 2D/3D graphics and animations. The project will also support an interdisciplinary team of art and engineering undergraduate students to create an interactive video game that teaches fundamental concepts in protein adsorption and assembly related to the proposed research for use in global outreach.

"Nonhuman primates employ different strategies to locate resources such as food and water that support survival and reproduction. This doctoral dissertation research project examines how wild Kinda baboons’ movement strategies vary according to the distribution of resources in complex environments, and how their dietary choices affect the distribution of bacteria in their guts. Results from the study will provide important insights linking evolutionary strategies to search for foodstuffs to physiological outcomes in a social primate. While conducting the work, the doctoral student will participate in educational science programs for under-served K-12 students and engage in public science through scientific blogs and social media. Additionally, the project will provide scientific training opportunities for diverse undergraduate students and a U.S.-based graduate student. 

The research investigates how the distribution of key nutritional resources – food and water – affect how baboons move through their environments. Research suggests that consuming different dietary resources impacts primate gut microbiomes, the microorganisms inhabiting the gut, which, in turn affect primate biology and health. This research uses data drawn from individual baboons residing in natural settings to complement scholarship that is based on environmental and climate proxies rather than direct evidence of nutritional choices. It also adds an explicit focus on water - a critical resource in dry environments and a source of gut bacteria - to understand how diverse dietary choices among individual baboons relate to gut health. The investigators will follow a habituated troop of Kinda baboons to collect behavioral (e.g., diet and movement) and biological (e.g., baboon fecal and water sample) data. Next, they will employ cutting-edge movement ecology analyses (e.g., hidden Markov models) to test different hypotheses related to baboon movement strategies. They will then quantify baboon microbiome diversity and analyze its relationship to water microbiome diversity and pathogen levels (e.g., E. coli and Giardia abundance).

"Studies of the microbiome have shown that gut microbe communities can affect a host’s ability to harvest energy and store fat. However, the significance of gut microbiome plasticity and its relevance to host survival when faced with environmental fluctuations in nutrient availability remains unclear. This doctoral dissertation research uses evolutionary and ecological approaches to examine gut microbiota changes in wild primates that cope with extreme variability in forest fruit production, resulting in substantial fluctuations in caloric intake and major shifts in the types of foods available for consumption. This study advances knowledge about primate microbiome adaptations, which may also provide comparative data for examining adaptations in the hominin lineage and microbiome function in modern humans. The project facilitates doctoral degree completion for a woman and first-generation student and provide field, laboratory, and bioinformatics training for students from groups underrepresented in STEM research. The project also enhance research capacity at the research location through training workshops and collaboration.  

Orangutans cope with environmentally-induced variations in diet, such as reductions in caloric intake by up to 48%, and fall short of their energetic requirements for several months out of the year. Because gut microbiota have the potential to be powerful drivers of orangutan energetics during periods of fruit scarcity, this study investigates whether gut microbial community compositions change across marked fluctuations in nutritional intake, and also whether those changes result in increased energy harvest and microbial energy production. More specifically, this project (1) monitors environmental changes in fruit availability; (2) uses observations to estimate food intake and match intake with known nutritional values; (3) identifies gut microbial compositions from fecal samples using Next-Generation DNA sequencing; and (4) approximates microbial energy production by measuring short-chain fatty acid concentrations in fecal samples.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and analytically validate a new, bio-inspired material as an alternative ultraviolet (UV)-filter that would fill an immediate societal and environmental need, which is to minimize the impacts of solar radiation without posing a risk to human health or the marine ecosystem. This is important, as existing commercial sunscreens suffer from five significant problems: (1) A large proportion of marketed sunscreens are ineffective at protecting skin from UV radiation. (2) Over 65% of non-mineral sunscreens contain chemicals that are toxic to marine ecosystems (i.e., ocean’s coral reefs). (3) Many common, conventional sunscreen chemicals may not even be human-safe and are currently being re-evaluated by regulatory bodies. (4) There is poor adoption of the safer, mineral-based sunscreens due to their negative aesthetic properties including a thick, white coating on the skin. (5) Early evidence indicates growing concerns that newer micro- and nano-based formulations of mineral sunscreens, which are visually more appealing, also have toxic impacts on both skin and the environment. The proposed technology innovation is aimed at replacing those currently in use as a safer, ecofriendly, and more effective alternative. 

The proposed project will overcome three technical hurdles involved in bringing a new ingredient into the suncare market. The first is aimed at simplifying the chemistry of the core class of molecules proposed in this work to ultimately reduce the production costs of the raw material to a market viable rate. The second will be to assess their utility and effectiveness in formulations at a range of sun protection factors. In addition to their UV-filtering performance, the photo- and thermal- stabilities of the formulations will be evaluated. The third is to investigate the safety of the proposed materials in formulations including cytocompatibility and anti-microbial assays.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a green manufacturing technology for titanium production.  Special metals, such as titanium and its alloys, have unique corrosion resistance, high specific strength, and excellent bio-compatibility.  These metals may be used in the fabrication of high-performance parts for medical implants and other applications such as deep sea mining and robotics.  In addition, the proposed room temperature process for titanium production may enable the development of future alloys such as high entropy alloys, which are not suitable for the current high temperature manufacturing process.  Also, the proposed manufacturing process may be applied to extract rare earth metals from their oxides, satisfying critical needs in manufacturing electric motors for the US auto industry.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of an electrochemical approach for titanium (Ti) parts manufacturing utilizing low-cost pigments (TiO2) refined into value-added products (e.g., Ti powders/wires) at room temperature.  Though electrochemical approaches have been exploited by others, the proposed technology is based on a unique liquid metal alloy as the anode. The liquid metal alloy has a “catalytic” capability, capable of accelerating titanium extractions from solid TiO2 without the need for elevated temperatures.  The resulting value-added products may be used as raw materials in additive manufacturing to deliver Ti parts.  This proposed room temperature process potentially may save more than 50% of the energy costs versus the traditional Ti refining process and may be easier to directly couple with additive manufacturing.  In addition, this technology may decrease the price of Ti powder from >$50 per pound to $4 per pound.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is development of green insulation materials for the over $50 billion-per-year building insulation industry. These materials will (i) have high R-values, (ii) be safe to install, (iii) not require toxic chemical and fossil fuel feedstocks, (iv) reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and (v) be produced securely in the United States.  By developing new biotechnology tools to make these materials, this project will advance the fields of energy conservation and material science and grow the bio-economy. The new materials will be sustainable, biologically grown versions of the best known insulation materials called aerogels.  As excellent insulators requiring little energy to produce, these biological aerogels will reduce GHG emissions. Being non-toxic, the materials will be safer to make and install. Production with locally-sourced materials will secure vulnerable supply chains revealed by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These materials will help meet increasing demand for green building materials. For example, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified buildings command premium new and resale prices, with under 300 certifications in 2007 growing to over 67,000 in 2018. 

Using genetically engineered bacteria, this SBIR Phase I project will develop an entirely new aerogel material that is a composite of bacterial cellulose (BC) and structures forming nanoscale cavities of air. This approach will circumvent the supercritical drying needed in the production of conventional aerogels, which is an expensive and energy intensive process because it requires high temperatures and high pressures. These biological aerogels materials will have excellent insulation properties comparable to conventional aerogels, (that is, high R-values) produced at a fraction of the cost. To create biological aerogels for insulation, the project plan is to (1) optimize production of the components (BC and nanoscale cavity structures), (2) use genetic engineering tools to merge the components to create a biologically-derived aerogel, and (3) create synthetic gene networks to endow the biological aerogel with hydrophobicity and fire-retardant properties needed for a building insulation material. The project will employ heterologous expression of genes in a tractable organism and systematic tuning of those genes to achieve its ambitious goals.

"The Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas at Austin (UTEX) is one of only a handful of curated, public, biodiversity collections of living algae. UTEX is a repository and distribution center for algal biodiversity. The UTEX Collection is of the most genetically diverse assemblages of organisms available to the public and many of the algae UTEX maintains are unique and irreplaceable. Every year UTEX distributes thousands of living algal cultures, at modest cost, to scientists, educators, and students throughout the U.S. and the world. The great interest in microscopic algae as sources of transportation fuel, human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, and many other uses makes UTEX algae and services essential resources for hundreds of research projects. UTEX provides hands-on workshops on managing algal cultures, an informative interactive web site, species identification services, chemical composition analysis, and extensive correspondence with students engaged in algal research. UTEX personnel give presentations at public schools, conduct tours of UTEX facilities, assist teachers and students in conducting high school science projects, and provide presentations on the scientific importance of algae to hundreds of children every year at local open house events.

UTEX currently maintains more than 3,000 unique living algal strains representing all major taxa, including over 450 type species. The UTEX mission is to promote, support, and enable the use of algae for research, education, and practical applications. In order to fulfill its mission, UTEX provides living algae to a user community at modest cost; serves as a permanent public repository of newly discovered and recently described algal species of potential value representing a broad range of genetic, morphological and biochemical diversity; acts as a source of information regarding algae to practicing scientists, other professionals, and the interested public; promotes and supports local science teaching and hands-on scientific activities by school children; and provides practical training services, support services, and supplies that facilitate culturing of algae at other sites. UTEX provides living algae starter cultures, bulk cultures, growth media, photobioreactors, photometers, genomic DNA and digital images.

"The Duke Lemur Center is responsible for two unique and irreplaceable collections: the largest living population of lemurs outside of their native Madagascar and a natural history collection that includes one of the most diverse primate fossil collections in the United States. The fossil collection – with specimens from the United States, Egypt, Madagascar, and Colombia – helps researchers use the tree of life to connect lemur research to other primates, including humans. Unfortunately, some of the most important fossils at the DLC, including some of the oldest lemur fossils and some of the oldest monkey fossils, are actively breaking down because unstable salt minerals were embedded in the specimens during fossilization. This project is a rescue mission to stabilize and preserve these fossils in physical and digital form. Highly trained fossil technicians will remove salt minerals from the most endangered specimens and store the revitalized fossils in new specimen cabinets that better control the temperature and humidity around the specimens. The team will also create 3D scans of the specimens using x-rays. The scans create a back-up record of the fossils in case they continue to deteriorate. The scans will be uploaded to MorphoSource, an online repository that allows educators, students, and researchers to examine fossils in 3D from any device with internet access. With a better-stabilized collection, the DLC fossil collection can open to the public for in-person and virtual tours, and online exhibits and curriculum guides will be created by the DLC education team using scans and 3D prints.
 
The most unstable fossils in the collection come from Locality 41 in the Fayum Depression in Egypt. The site is one of the most fossil-dense terrestrial Paleogene localities in Africa. Along with primates like Catopithecus and Plesiopithecus, the site preserves giant hyraxes, rodents, bats, snakes, birds, and carnivores. The tennis-court sized fossil deposit in the Western Desert of Egypt was actively quarried in the 1980s through 2010s. The most fossil-rich sections were targeted by the excavation teams. This makes the collection at the DLC irreplaceable through additional fieldwork. This project partially supports a Fossil Preparator who will focus on the Egyptian collection as well as other unstable materials in the collection. It also partially supports a Digital Tomographer who will use the Duke microCT scanner to generate scans of the most at-risk specimens, and the DLC Data Manager who will work with the Tomographer to backup and upload scan data to MorphoSource. The data manager will lead the effort to add higher resolution specimen data to the DLC Specify database, which will integrate with iDigBio (idigbio.org) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (gbif.org). The project also supports microCT scanner access and new specimen storage cabinets. The DLC education team will use these newly stable specimens to create curriculum-targeted tours and guides for North Carolina K-12 students and visitors to the DLC. Ultimately, exceedingly fragile fossil specimens will be available in-person and online to researchers, students, and the general public.

"The Northeast Bioengineering Conference (NEBEC) has historically been a student-centered conference and the 2021 version will continue that tradition by providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to present their work. The conference will also hold state-of-the art faculty seminars in theme areas selected to reflect emerging or growing areas in BME. Notably, a significant portion of the conference is dedicated to education in BME, especially given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on instructional models. These activities will expose students and faculty to leading edge research in BME, foster interest in pursuing careers in BME research and innovation and provide networking opportunities with peers and leaders in their fields.
 
The conference serves the dual purpose of (1) providing a venue for undergraduate and early-stage graduate students to present their work at what will be for many their first professional-level conference, and (2) exposing these students to truly cutting-edge advances in research areas of relevance to the region and nationally. This iteration of the conference will be entirely virtual and will feature an undergraduate design competition; three Keynote addresses from distinguished faculty members with diverse research, educational and cultural backgrounds; four faculty seminar sessions in the theme areas: Neural Engineering, Regenerative Engineering, Biomaterials and Biocompatibility, and Medical Product; and a special session on education – Changing the Landscape of Education – with participation from Northeast colleagues. Outstanding submitted abstracts will be selected for podium presentations in parallel sessions grouped by topic. The remaining abstracts will be given poster presentations. Social hours with networking activities and virtual booths both for academia and industry are planned to encourage attendee engagement. The regional nature of the conference brings together faculty from neighboring schools to discover potential for new collaborations. It also exposes undergraduate students to opportunities for graduate study at nearby institutions. The networking sessions will include discussions of career opportunities in BME, with a focus on entrepreneurship in a variety of settings. The goal of the networking events is to also encourage interaction between students and the invited faculty speakers. Targeted recruitment strategies will reach a diverse audience, including those traditionally underrepresented, to broaden participation in biomedical engineering. Abstracts of presentations at the conference will be disseminated to professionals and the general public via the NEBEC.org website for 3 years following the conference.

"The skin microbiome — the collection of microorganisms that live on the surface of the human body — plays a critical role in regulating the immune system, yet little is known about how infants first acquire skin microbes in early life. Since microbes are transmitted between people, and human infancy is highly social, interactions with caregivers may be a critical component of infant skin microbiome development. This doctoral dissertation project examines how infant social networks and specific interactions between infants and their caregivers influence the diversity of microbes living on infants’ skin. Results of this project shed light on the understudied relationship between social behaviors and the infant skin microbiome, as well as laying the foundation for future studies that connect early life microbial exposures to particular physiological outcomes. Study participants, including mothers and other caregivers, will receive personalized reports based on research results, including information about their social networks as well as the structure of their skin microbiome and how it compares to that of their infant. This project also contributes to enhancing diversity and inclusion by training undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM research in skin microbiome laboratory methods and statistical analyses. The project also has public health translational potential with respect to infant wellbeing.

Unlike other great apes, human mothers rely on additional caregivers, such as grandparents and older siblings, for long-term assistance with infant care. Common infant care practices, including holding and carrying, promote direct skin-to-skin contact between caregivers and infants, suggesting opportunities for skin microbes to be shared with infants. This project will investigate how social caregiving influences the infant skin microbiome, with an emphasis on the microbial similarity between the skin of infants and their caregivers. Researchers will collect skin swab samples from infants, mothers, and additional caregivers, and use microbial gene sequencing to characterize and compare the skin microbes present in the samples. Caregivers will complete questionnaires that ask about the frequency of specific practices that put them in physical contact with infants. The researchers will use these data to generate social networks that describe social relationships between infants and their caregivers, suggesting potential routes through which skin microbes are shared with infants. This project offers a novel perspective on the benefits of social caregiving to infants, and the results will highlight the role that the social environment plays in linking early life microbial exposures to health outcomes.

"This award will provide travel support for 13 U.S.-based undergraduate students to attend the 2021 Meeting of the North American Membrane Society (NAMS) at Estes Park, Colorado. NAMS is a premier membrane conference, providing outstanding technical sessions across the full breadth of topics within membrane science and technology. The theme of the 2021 meeting is ""Convergence - Connecting Membrane Science to Societal Challenges,"" which aligns with several Grand Challenges recently identified by the National Academy of Engineering. The meeting has a rich history of engaging graduate student researchers directly through targeted programs and award opportunities. The goal of this travel support is to extend these opportunities to undergraduate researchers who identify as a member of an underrepresented group in STEM and might otherwise be unable to attend the conference. Additionally, it will provide a platform for students to network with community leaders and fellow undergraduate and graduate students. A unique undergraduate mentoring program will foster inclusivity and encourage the students to take full advantage of the technical, social, and networking opportunities available at NAMS 2021. Early engagement in a professional society/conference will provide students with motivation and encouragement to pursue advanced degrees in their respective fields and, subsequently, develop a healthy and diverse workforce.

The NAMS organizing committee is comprised of diverse North American researchers, and invited speakers from academia, industry, and government labs feature prominently in the program. The meeting will feature 26 technical sessions, daily plenary sessions, a poster session, and abundant unstructured discussion periods to catalyze new collaborative relationships and research ideas. The 2021 NAMS meeting will cover a variety of topics ranging from fundamental studies of membrane material science to process systems development and applications of membrane technology in water, bioprocessing, chemical separations, environmental systems, and energy. Historically, hundreds of graduate students participate in the NAMS meeting and engage in unique professional development and training opportunities. This award will extend such opportunities to a cohort of U.S. undergraduate students with the intention of growing and retaining a diverse community of membrane scientists and engineers. All undergraduate attendees will be paired with senior graduate student mentors who will serve as meeting guides and support an immersive experience. The program's effectiveness will be assessed through surveys and observation of student outcomes. It is anticipated that the award for travel and registration fee subsidies will attract diverse young scientists in the field and enhance the membrane science and technology workforce.

"This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) grant will contribute to the advancement of national prosperity and economic welfare by studying efficient operations of single use scalable individualized manufacturing systems. Developing and manufacturing a new drug now often faces very tight deadlines, and a myriad of individual variants may be required to be produced. In such scenarios traditional large batch-production is generally poorly suited because of low flexibility in the quantity and type of drug being manufactured, large set up times between production runs and inability to distribute manufacturing capacity across locations and product types. This award supports better understanding of single use manufacturing as the fundamental enabler for renewed production flexibility in terms of both type variety and volume. This research will serve the biopharmaceutical manufacturing environment as well as the manufacturing community at large, promoting a new way to scale out instead of scaling up manufacturing systems. The accompanying educational plan aims to broaden STEM interest in simulation and, particularly, simulation based optimization aiming at the development of new tools for teaching and research, with a particular focus on creating a diverse research and educational ecosystem.

This research will focus on the advancement of simulation based optimization methods to support decision making for the operation of individualized manufacturing systems. The project will result in new methods for the acceleration of black box optimization. The framework will consider the specific challenges of operating a large number of manufacturing processes at small scale, allowing to  use the process simulation not only as a means to evaluate the performance, but also to provide structural properties of the process being operated. This research fills an important gap in the black box optimization literature, which reportedly suffers from poor finite time performance, only exploit output of the simulation model and ignores sample path information, and, finally, faces important hurdles in scaling to solve high dimensional problems. The analytical infrastructure leverages and extends state-of-the-art techniques from Bayesian optimization, high dimensional statistics, and model predictive control. The project will devise methods to efficiently achieve satisfactory solutions to simulation based optimization in presence of discontinuities resulting from the dynamics of the system. Finite time performance of the algorithms will be studied, and high dimensional problems will be central to the development of the techniques. The performance of the techniques will be evaluated not only using synthetic state of the art black box optimization problems, but using large scale production of a large variety of bio-products in an individualized manufacturing set-up. With the idea to promote this new idea of manufacturing and the concepts of simulation-supported decision making, a game will be implemented to attract students, as well as, potentially, practitioners, to the area of manufacturing and operations research.

"This project examines how networks of collaborative research are challenging the way we study about soils. Contemporary understanding of soil focus on how it is a one of the most biodiverse and critical ecosystems on the planet. This project will trace how scientific practices of studying soil microbes are driving terrestrial cycles of carbon, water, phosphorous, and nitrogen. It will follow scientists as they investigate soil microbial activity in relation to climate conditions, plant pathogens, and medicinal resources for humans. The project will document how novel research techniques are helping scientists design soil microbial processes to respond to changing climate conditions and soil issues.  The project will provide insight for natural scientists, social scientists, and policymakers to better understand how specific soil science practices inform current priorities and challenges of soil health.

The central focus of this research project is the collaborative networks of soil scientists and biotech engineers. The project uses ethnographic strategies to trace the social and technical infrastructure of soil microbiology research through which scientists assemble their understanding of soils as living systems. Its analysis draws on qualitative data from interviews with scientists and participant observation in soil research settings. While human-soil interactions are often examined in agricultural contexts, this project is among the first to examine how scientists construct new meanings and materialities of soils in their research practices. Scientific explorations of soil microbiomes are contributing to mapping new frontiers of ecological knowledge. This project will study how political and cultural transformations can support new possibilities for human adaptation and survival on a rapidly changing planet.

"This project will develop novel, body-worn, flexible sensors fabricated using low-cost inkjet printing technology on thin film polymers, develop novel algorithms capable of automatically detecting health events in different contexts, and develop a novel data reliability metric by analyzing sensor and context data in real-time. The project will produce practice components for test and validation in a clinical setting with cardiac patients to determine their effectiveness for monitoring heart conditions. If successful, the project will provide patients and clinicians with a tool to improve health monitoring in natural environments. The research is expected to impact additive manufacturing methods, flexible electronics, health monitoring, and smart and connected communities initiatives. It will also provide training for undergraduate and graduate students and expose the next generation of scholars and workers to these technologies through a Summer Code Camp for high school students.

Next generation Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) must utilize resilient and reliable cyber/physical interfacing, be economically viable, and be capable of processing extremely large data automatically and reliably. Achieving this requires overcoming current technological barriers associated with seamless integration of computation and physical domains and meaningful interpretation of multimodal and multigrain data of scalable CPS. Balancing theory with experimentation, this project will: 1) produce foundational engineering process for CPS interface with thin-film flexible electronic electrodes and low cost sensors fabricated with inkjet printing; 2) develop new algorithms for autonomous processing of sensor data to detect context-aware events of interest and data reliability metric for closed-loop CPS using real-time machine learning implemented at edge; and 3) deploy CPS practice components in a real-life pilot study to explore detection of cardiac episodes and explore various closed loop feedback approaches.

"This research will develop molecular tools that allow the study of membrane proteins (MPs), which are among the most important, but least understood components of cells. All cells are surrounded by lipid membranes that are almost impermeable to water, salts or nutrients that cells need. For this reason, many membrane proteins (MPs) are inserted into the membranes that control cellular functions such as material transport, sensing, intercellular communication, cell adhesion, and energy conversion. MPs are also the targets for many therapeutic drug molecules. Knowledge of the molecular structure of MPs is necessary to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of their function and can guide the development of therapeutic drugs for many common diseases. However, MPs are difficult to study and therefore the molecular structure of most MPs is still unknown. The goal of this project is to develop broadly applicable new tools using DNA nanotechnology that will facilitate solving MP structures with cryo-electron microscopes. This project will provide research opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students from underrepresented minority groups through several established programs, which will inform them about experimental research and potential career opportunities. Finally, introductory physics courses will be strengthened by developing modules that underline interdisciplinary aspects and applications of physical principles, and an interdisciplinary molecular biophysics course will be developed. These efforts will train the next generation of diverse, interdisciplinary leaders in STEM research and technology.


Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is becoming the standard method for MP structure determination, but several experimental challenges have prevented solving more than 1% of human MP structures so far. The overall goal of this project is to establish DNA-lipid nanodiscs (DLNs) as a radically new customizable nanoscale lipid bilayer mimetic for single-particle cryo-EM of MPs. This DNA nanotechnology-based approach will overcome existing limitations of established bilayer mimetics and offer unprecedented control over structural, chemical and physical design parameters that could transform MP research. Such a paradigm shift involves significant risks and requires substantial exploratory development efforts. First, strategies will be developed to increase synthesis yields and to prevent lipid bilayer aggregation. Next, MP expression, purification and co-reconstitution of MPs in DLNs need to be established. Then, freezing conditions, additives and other sample preparation parameters need to be iteratively optimized to produce high quality grids for imaging. It is expected that the same or better resolutions can be achieved than with established bilayer mimetics, while providing new functionalities and unprecedented programmability. It is expected that DNA-lipid nanodiscs will initiate new research in structural biology, pharmacology, virology and bio-catalysis and therefore enhance the understanding of common diseases. The methods and models developed in this research will be made publicly available to benefit the larger scientific community researching the mechanisms of actions of drugs and vaccines.

"Viruses and bacteria are thought to have played an important role in shaping primate evolution, but many open questions remain about how pathogens have acted to change primate genomes and influence trait diversity. More can be learned about the types of pathogens that have been most important in primate evolution, the types of genetic variants that have arisen to deal with these threats, and whether genetic variation in immune genes influences fitness-related traits in the present. This doctoral dissertation project studies the regulation of genes involved in immune defense in a wild primate system, focusing on an intensively studied population for which demographic, behavioral, and physiological data are also available. The doctoral student investigates how natural selection has shaped the gene expression response to pathogens in the past, and examines associations between immune-related gene expression variation, dominance rank, and other physiological characteristics. The project supports student mentorship and training opportunities, international research collaborations, and public science engagement through museum and conference events. 

The investigator measures genome-wide gene expression in either the presence or absence of stimuli that model bacterial or viral infection, for 160 individually recognized adult baboons. Differences in immune responses are examined for linkages to genetic differences between baboons, controlling for age, dominance rank, kinship, and other factors that also influence immune function. Integrating these findings with genome sequences from the same baboon population, the project investigates whether genes involved in the immune response to bacteria and/or viruses have been the target of historic or recent selection and tests whether genetic variation that influences the immune response also affects traits that are important to current physiological wellbeing and fitness.

"With the support from the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) Program in the Division of Chemistry (CHE), Dr. John A. Latham from the University of Denver will investigate how the chemistry is carried out in the synthesis of the bacterial vitamin, mycofactocin. Bacteria produce numerous compounds, or natural products that enable competition for resources, detoxifying environments, and carrying out critical cellular processes. Mycofactocin, a bacterial vitamin which is required for shuttling electrons in critical cellular processes in Mycobacteria. Mycofactocin is made from a peptide using a powerful enzyme, MftC, in a way that is unusual in comparison to other peptide natural products. This study is expected to result in new understanding of this chemistry and a new class of bioengineered redox cofactors, which in turn will help to elucidate mycofactocin-dependent physiological processes. This work allows for graduate students and middle school science teachers to gain specialized training in mechanistic enzymology and rational bioengineering. In addition, through outreach programming, this work will incorporate products produced by high school and middle school students. 

Mycofactocin maturase, MftC, is a radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme (rSAM) that catalyzes the most critical steps in mycofactocin biosynthesis. It is just one of a broad class of radical SAM enzymes in Nature and so mechanistic insights gleaned in this project will likely have much broader scientific impact upon studies and understanding of other members of this important enzymatic class. MftC modifies the precursor peptide, MftA, by oxidatively decarboxylating the C-terminal tyrosine and by the formation of a lactam between the penultimate valine and the C-terminal tyrosine. The reaction scope of MftC will be evaluated to determine the requirement of an electron sink (tyrosine) on the C-terminus and if the conservation of valine tunes the midpoint potential of mycofactocin. Objective 1 focuses on defining the mechanistic role of tyrosine by evaluating kinetic isotope effects and pKa effects of tyrosine analogs. Objective 2 establishes the chemical logic for the conservation of valine by evaluating substituent effects on the midpoint potential of mycofactocin. The project will advance the understanding rSAM mechanisms and establish the framework for the rational design of a new class of redox cofactors.

"An award is made to the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) to establish a dedicated laboratory for the isolation of ancient DNA and proteins preserved in biological tissues and environmental samples. Ancient, often poorly preserved, tissues provide a treasure trove of previously inaccessible molecular information on the history of life on Earth. The new AMNH facility will be a national resource, providing the research community with an ultraclean lab in which students, early career scientists, and established scientists can undertake supervised extraction of degraded biological materials under best-practices conditions. In addition to the physical laboratory, this award will support activities to strengthen national expertise in ancient biomolecular research through the production of training materials and a symposium in which experts share their knowledge with novice and experienced practitioners. This project will have broader educational impact through programs for students and teachers, including open-access teaching resources that increase awareness regarding the utility of ancient DNA and proteins in modern science. 

Recent advances in DNA sequencing, proteomics, and bioinformatics have enabled extraordinary advances in understanding the history of life and its diversity on Earth. Yet the full impact of these tools has not been fully realized in historical biology and related disciplines, such as archaeology, paleontology, paleoecology, paleoclimatology, and physical anthropology. This is partly because ancient biomolecules, recovered from macrofossils or sediments, require specialized treatment: they tend to be highly degraded and easily contaminated by modern biomolecules. Only a handful of labs in the USA are capable of meeting the highest standards of specimen preparation, and access to these facilities is currently limited. This project will bring a uniform level of support to researchers from across the country who are interested in utilizing ancient biomolecular information in their investigations. The AMNH Ancient Biomolecules Facility is intended to make available to visitors a uniquely designed clean room and cutting-edge instrumentation for biomolecular extraction and quality assessment for genomic and proteomic applications. On-site extraction and safe handling of ancient DNA and proteins will greatly simplify researchers’ investment in the time and effort needed for optimal data acquisition, circumvent lengthy permitting processes, and expedite the dissemination of results to the scientific community. Serving as a national center for ancient biomolecular extractions, the AMNH facility will also act as a clearing house for biomolecular studies, providing training to students and other practitioners, fostering collaborations, developing new techniques and standards, and promoting the value of ancient biomolecules as an investigatory tool.

"Aspects of lifestyle play an important role in shaping how individuals age, but most of what we know about human senescence stems from work with industrialized populations, who do not represent the full range of lifestyles modern humans engage in. This doctoral dissertation project will examine human aging in a non-industrialized population, and evaluate how aspects of lifestyle contribute to age-related patterns of physical and cognitive function. This project will help create a broader picture of how humans experience growing older across a range of biosocial contexts, and so advance our fundamental knowledge about human senescence. The project will inform public health research by examining whether certain aspects of aging can be mitigated through elements of lifestyle. Furthermore, by employing an interdisciplinary approach to the study of aging, this project will strengthen research infrastructure ties among several institutions and departments, and also contribute to the professional development of women in STEM fields. 

In industrialized populations, growing older is associated with declines in physical and cognitive function that limit independence and increase risk of disability. Large-scale epidemiological studies indicate that engaging in high levels of physical activity (PA) may attenuate age-related declines in function. It is not clear, then, whether the age-related functional declines seen in industrialized populations are inevitable aspects of human senescence or by-products of sedentary industrialized lifestyles. This project will examine variation in lifestyle and aging in hunter-gatherer populations that currently include members who continue to engage in full-time foraging, and others who engage in more market-integrated lifestyles with less reliance on foraging. The project tests the overarching hypothesis that variation in engagement in traditional foraging practices is associated with distinctive PA profiles that benefit age-related patterns of physical and cognitive function. Researchers will recruit participants (ages 18+) from communities who engage in different amounts of foraging, and participants will complete tests of physical and cognitive function. Participants will also wear an accelerometer for several days, allowing researchers to characterize patterns of PA. The researchers will compare age-related patterns of function for non-industrialized and industrialized populations, as well as assess whether amount of foraging is related to variation in age-related patterns of function. They will also use formal mediation analyses to assess how patterns of PA influence the relationship between age, function, and amount of foraging.

"Closing the loop on biological wastes is a critical global challenge given the expectation that the Earth will support roughly 9 billion people by 2050. Biological wastes are rich resources that contain a range of nutrients as well as water. Many of the molecules found in bio-waste can be transformed into products of value to society – fertilizers, protein, energy, clean water, medicine, and advanced biomaterials. This project promotes scientific progress and advances the health, prosperity, and welfare of the nation, consistent with the NSF’s mission. It does this by engaging cohorts of budding researchers into research projects aimed at converting biological waste materials back into products of value. At the same time, it trains student participants on how to conduct research and, of equal importance, how to communicate that work to the broader community. Participant students will be recruited from populations that are underrepresented in technical fields, as well as populations who currently lack access to research opportunities. The outcome will be a better-trained, diverse scientific workforce, which will help deliver solutions that benefit both people and the environment.

The objective of this project is to establish a new REU site that integrates undergraduate students in team-based research projects focused on converting biological wastes into products of value. The proposed REU site will provide a 10-week summer research experience for ten students each year, over a 3 year period. REU students will be paired with faculty teams working in four different areas: 1) use of fish waste for sustainable aquaponics vegetable production, 2) upgrading wastewater nutrients into zooplankton fish feed, 3) transforming cellulose into sensors for infectious disease detection, and 4) conversion of lignin into adhesives and carbon fiber. As the most abundant biopolymers on Earth, cellulose and lignin are widely available in a range of waste biomass resources. REU student participants will not only gain research experience through this project, they will also receive training on teamwork and communication best practices through a suite of professional development opportunities. These efforts will yield two major outcomes: 1) a cohort of young researchers, many from underrepresented groups, who have strong understanding of interdisciplinary team-based research, and 2) publications showcasing the work of these students to the broader research community.

This project is jointly funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (Directorate for Engineering), and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"Communication and networking play a key role in the development and functioning of living organisms. The physical DNA interactions within the genome, or network of genes, determine gene activities and thereby the development and function of cells, similarly as the software determines the operation of the hardware in a computer. Therefore, being able to program genomic interactions and thereby the development of communicating neuronal networks is at the basis of transformative applications. In this direction, optogenomics, or the control of the genome function through light, is proposed. Optogenomics offers an unprecedented means to control organ and specifically brain development and functions, or even new corrective treatments of cancer and other diseases. Such control will be enabled through development of novel directional light emitting nano-devices. The goal of this inter-disciplinary project is to study information processing and learning (and, thus, ultimately memory) in neuronal networks orchestrated by the light manipulation of the genome. For this, new photonic and electronic tools will be developed to program the genome in neurons and to study both the resulting changes in the structure and activity in networks of living neurons. This project will provide inter-disciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, who will become versed in both nanophotonics and nanoelectronics as well as neuronal cell studies.

Beyond optogenetic platforms, which are aimed at the use of light to control cell-cell interactions, optogenomic systems allow the control of DNA interactions in the genome and, thus, the programming of the cell development and function. In this project, new optogenomic tools will be developed to control the development and information processing and learning in neuronal networks. In the proposed system, neural stem cells will be transfected with optimized optogenomic constructs that combine light-activated algae proteins and mammalian genome regulators. As the input to the system, the constructs will be activated globally across the cell culture through LED-based homogeneous illumination. The light-induced changes in the genome 3D structure and function will be analyzed using Chromatin Conformation Capture HiC/HiChIP, Atomic Force Microscopy, and RNAseq with the NextGene global genome sequencing. The output of the system will be the opto-electrophysiological analysis of signal processing in optogenomically constructed neuronal networks, with innovative transparent flexile beamforming nanophotonic devices combined with flexible high-density microelectrode arrays, using metrics like Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity, Hebbian learning and network science. An integrated Genome-Neuronal Function Model will be developed for the first time by correlating genomic topological networks to the functional gene networks and ultimately to the properties of the resultant neuronal network as they form in 3D model of the human brain – cerebral organoids.

"Emerging infectious diseases are an inevitable part of our world. Mathematical models can inform scientific understanding of these complex and ever-changing systems, as well as public health policy. In particular, mechanistic models, mathematical models that describe the key processes that drive dynamic, real-world systems, along with empirical data, can be useful for assessing the efficacy of different control strategies, or testing different hypotheses about the underlying biology. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored both the importance of mechanistic models and the challenges of implementing these models to inform policy. One of these challenges, which spans disciplines, arises when there is a mismatch between the data available and the data required to inform these models and  reduce uncertainty in model outputs and predictions. A model-data mismatch could lead to erroneous conclusions about which control policies will be most effective at achieving a particular goal. This project aims to create a methodology that finds the most cost-effective approach to data collection for a given mathematical model, such that the model produces reliable outputs and measures of uncertainty. Applying these methods to recent case studies like COVID-19, Zika, and Ebola can inform appropriate responses to, and improve preparedness for, future pandemics. These methods will also be applicable to areas of ecology and physiology, where the overarching goal of integrating modeling and empirical studies is critical to progress. Integral to the research objectives is a new education program targeting undergraduate students, with unrecognized potential in STEM. A series of educational 
modules will engage students in the fundamentals of mathematical modeling, coding, and visualization, using a collaborative and inquiry-based approach. Participants will hone these skills by working with epidemiological models related to the proposed project, and will use their creativity and unique perspectives as novice modelers with diverse backgrounds to promote model literacy in the general public.

One way to address the problem of a model-data mismatch is first to evaluate the practical identifiability of a model, that is, the ability to estimate model parameters unambiguously from data, given a particular data set.  Conclusions derived from a practically unidentifiable model may not be robust.  Furthermore, commonly used methods to determine practical identifiability of epidemiological models rely on simple likelihood models (functions proportional to the probability of observed data given the model parameters) that make unrealistic assumptions about epidemiological data, which in reality are highly correlated and complex.  A poor approximation to the true likelihood model can lead to inaccurate estimates of uncertainty in model outputs.  Using appropriate identifiability metrics and improved (yet tractable) likelihood models, control theory can be leveraged to derive data sampling strategies, constrained by finite public health resources, that render a model practically identifiable.  The approach is to find sampling protocols that jointly minimize the identifiability metric and the cost of the sampling strategy.  These new methods will be tested using synthetic data, and applied to recent outbreaks to determine what data sampling strategies would have been sufficient to reduce the uncertainty in model parameter estimates, and therefore, reduce uncertainty in model outputs.

"In the past year, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted the livelihoods of our planet’s human inhabitants, infecting over 85 million individuals, and causing nearly 2 million deaths.

"In this CAREER project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Gaël Ung of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Connecticut is developing molecules capable of emitting circularly polarized light, light possessing right-handed or left-handed rotation with respect to the direction of propagation. This next-generation light source provides potential opportunities to enhance optical three-dimensional displays, bio-imaging, and security inks. The goal is to obtain molecules emitting strong circularly polarized luminescence in the visible and near-infrared region. This  is to be achieved by rigorous evaluation of the relationship between chemical structure and circularly polarized luminescence properties. This project is tied to a research program supporting low-income first-generation college students who typically work part- or full-time to sustain themselves, allowing them to be as successful as other students who can afford to take research in STEM fields without sacrificing financial stability.

In this project, Dr. Ung and his group examine the effect of symmetry, structural rigidity, and coordination geometry on the circularly polarized luminescence of lanthanide complexes. Modular ternary lanthanide complexes supported by chiral hexadentate ligands have been designed for the structure-function study. Two specific groups of lanthanides will be studied, either emitting in the visible region, or in the near-infrared region of the spectrum. An appropriate combination of chiral ligand and sensitizer will allow for the synthesis of molecules exhibiting strong circularly polarized luminescence. The team will also examine the effect of ligand substitution on the circularly polarized luminescence of chiral copper complexes, providing a more sustainable alternative for the development of circularly polarized emitters.

"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY
The Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems in the Engineering Directorate contribute funds to this CAREER award. It supports research, educational, and outreach activities to advance the fundamental understanding and design of nanomaterials. Spherical metal nanoparticles less than 10 nanometers in diameter are promising materials for biomedical applications because they can circulate in the bloodstream for long periods of time and interact with target cells. Some applications, such as the delivery of nucleic acids, require nanoparticles to enter the cell interior by crossing the cell membrane - the barrier that separates the cell interior from the environment - without damaging the cell. A small number of nanoparticles have exhibited this desirable cell entry behavior, but the mechanisms underlying this behavior are not understood. Consequently, general rules for designing nanoparticles that can efficiently cross the cell membrane do not exist.

The PI will utilize a combination of computational methods to address this knowledge gap and test hypotheses to understand how the properties of nanoparticles affect their interaction with cell membranes. Such methods permit the analysis of nanoparticle properties and interactions that are difficult to discern experimentally and to gain insight into the fundamental mechanisms by which nanoparticles enter cells. New machine learning methods will be further developed to predict how nanoparticle properties can be synthetically tuned to facilitate cell entry. This computational approach will permit the creation of new types of nanoparticles more rapidly than would be possible through experiments alone, enabling the rational design of next-generation nanomaterials with various biomedical applications.

This award also supports integrated education and outreach activities. The PI will create visually appealing, interactive, and easily accessible computer simulations that illustrate molecular-scale phenomena. These simulations will be used as a “computational microscope” to demonstrate nanoscale phenomena to the public and grade 6-12 students during events hosted on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. They will also be integrated into a range of undergraduate chemical engineering courses and disseminated broadly through online resources. The project will further help train the next generation of scientists in computational science by providing research opportunities for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups and local high school teachers. 

TECHNICAL SUMMARY
This CAREER award supports research, and integrated educational, and outreach activities to advance the fundamental understanding and design of functionalized nanomaterials. Designing materials to efficiently deliver cargo to intracellular targets without adverse side effects would have a transformative impact on biomedical applications including protein and drug delivery, gene editing, and bioimaging. Surface-functionalized gold nanoparticles have the potential to achieve this goal, but a longstanding challenge is designing nanoparticles that can enter cells without being trapped in endosomes and without disrupting the cell membrane. Surprisingly, some nanoparticles can non-disruptively penetrate into cells by translocating across the cell membrane, potentially enabling exciting new avenues for intracellular delivery. However, cell penetration mechanisms remain largely unknown, inhibiting the optimization and design of cell-penetrating nanoparticles.

To address this knowledge gap, this project will use molecular dynamics simulations at multiple length scales to understand the thermodynamic and kinetic factors that influence the insertion of nanoparticles into lipid bilayers and test the hypothesis that bilayer insertion predicts cell penetration. The objectives of this project are to: (1) characterize mechanisms of bilayer insertion for different nanoparticle compositions using all-atom simulations with enhanced sampling techniques, (2) determine the impact of bilayer composition on nanoparticle insertion and penetration with coarse-grained simulations, and (3) train machine learning models to discover new classes of synthetically accessible cell-penetrating nanoparticles. Computational predictions of new cell-penetrating nanoparticles will be experimentally verified by collaborators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. These studies will provide new insight into nano-bio interactions that will impact understanding of diverse classes of nanomaterials and demonstrate how the combination of machine learning and molecular simulation can inform nanomaterial design.

This award also supports integrated education and outreach activities. The PI will design simulation modules that utilize molecular dynamics simulations to illustrate nanoscale phenomena. Modules will be: (1) visually appealing, to engage students and illustrate concepts; (2) interactive, to increase student engagement and improve learning outcomes; (3) accessible, to ensure simulations can be performed without computational expertise; and (4) distributable, to maximize impact without requiring substantial computational resources. Modules will be designed in collaboration with educational experts then integrated into outreach events to impact grade 6-12 students, integrated into classes within the University of Wisconsin-Madison chemical engineering curriculum to engage undergraduate students, and will be disseminated online to the broader nanomaterials education community. Module development will also broaden participation by providing opportunities for undergraduates from underrepresented groups to contribute to the project’s research activities.

"PART 1:   NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY

This CAREER proposal aims to develop a new class of peptide-based biomaterials. The peptide-based technology will enable modular design of biomaterials able to form ordered nanoparticle aggregates with multiple functionalities in order to overcome significant barriers to delivery of bioactive molecules. The PI will characterize the structure, charge, and stimuli-responsiveness of the designed nanomaterials and determine the effect of these characteristics on enhancing cell-specific uptake and bioactivity of delivered cargo. The technology will provide a novel biomaterial platform with applications in transporting a variety of nucleic acids used to regulate gene expression. The proposal integrates a comprehensive education plan with a core objective of increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities in bioengineering. The education plan will enable early engagement of high school students through hands-on learning modules and engagement of undergraduates through early exposure to bioengineering concepts and laboratory research. The plan includes partnerships with minority-serving institutions to establish a pipeline toward graduate degrees in bioengineering. 


PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY

The PI’s long-term research goal is to develop novel bioresponsive nanocarriers through the investigation of modular self-assembled peptides. In pursuit of this goal, the research objective of the proposal is to develop and characterize a novel class of multifunctional peptide-based biomaterials. These nanocarriers will consist of a modular design including various classes of peptides, such as cell penetrating, fusogenic and targeting peptides, each with the ability to overcome a significant barrier to delivery, including insufficient cellular internalization and lack of endosomal escape. The peptide-based nanoparticles will be characterized to determine 1) the bioresponsiveness of the peptide secondary structure in inducing endosomal escape and 2) the size, charge, and serum stability of the nanocomplexes. The modular peptide components will be combined to create a multifunctional nanomaterial that will be evaluated to assess cell-biomaterial interactions, in particular, biocompatibility, cellular uptake, and endosomal activity. The peptide-based technology has applications in delivery of nucleic acid therapies, such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). The PI’s long-term educational goal is to increase participation of underrepresented minorities in bioengineering. The proposed educational objectives are to: 1) engage high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in bioengineering research, 2) provide underrepresented minority first-year students early exposure to bioengineering topics, and 3) partner with minority-serving institutions in S.C. to create a pipeline program towards graduate degrees in bioengineering. Outcomes will include leading a team of undergraduates in development of hands-on bioengineering and nanodelivery lab modules that will be implemented in local underserved high schools. Furthermore, undergraduates will be recruited to participate in summer research projects through partnerships with minority-serving institutions in the state to establish a collaborative effort toward enhancing participation of underrepresented students in graduate programs in bioengineering.

"Silver nanoparticles are extensively used for their antimicrobial properties in an increasing number of consumer and commercial products as well as in wastewater treatment.   Understanding the potential toxicity and environmental impacts of silver nanoparticles is challenging. Because silver nanoparticles undergo ionic dissolution, discrepancies exist over the relative contribution of silver ions or the nanoparticles themselves in toxicity.   This project will increase understanding of how silver nanoparticle properties affect bio-uptake, nanoparticle-biological interactions, and ecotoxicity.  Effects of particle surface oxidation and ionic dissolution, which have complicated toxicity studies in the past, will be eliminated. This study will identify properties of silver nanoparticles that make them ecologically disruptive leading to adverse environmental outcomes. All data will be shared through the open-source knowledge base of Nanomaterial-Biological Interactions (NBI) globally for modeling efforts and will support the development of safety protocols, exposure guidelines, and regulations that protect human and ecosystem health. Furthermore, this research will provide design rules for the assembly of new classes of silver nanoparticles that could be commercialized without concern regarding rapid particle degradation and release into the environment. In addition, this project is designed to incorporate students from diverse backgrounds and will help build future science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) talent.

The researcher's overall aim is to improve our understanding of the specific physiochemical features that dictate nanoparticle-biological interactions. First, they will design a series of lipid-coated silver nanoparticles that are differentially shielded from ion dissolution. Differentially shielded silver nanoparticles will be prepared by encapsulating silver nanoparticles of varying size and shape with a hybrid lipid-membrane to protect the surface from oxidation and ionic dissolution. Changes in the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), thermal electron microscope (TEM), and (Inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) will be employed to monitor silver ion dissolution from the suite of nanoparticles. Second, they will identify features of lipid-coated nanoparticles that lead to particle instability. The agglomeration kinetics of the hybrid lipid-coated silver nanoparticles will be assessed using dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Third, since the goal is to ultimately relate these material features with nanoparticle-biological interactions, the researchers will determine the uptake and toxicity of the silver nanoparticle suite. Based on preliminary investigations, the hybrid lipid-coated silver nanoparticles with a robust coating should elicit minimal toxicity and a decrease in surface coverage should lead to a respective increase in toxicity. A well-established embryonic zebrafish assay will be used to identify vertebrate morbidity and mortality resulting from exposure and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) will be used to visualize nanoparticle uptake in whole animals. Finally, the researchers will assess the potential ecotoxicity of the suite using a novel nanocosm assay. Hyperspectral imaging will be used to visualize nanoparticle biodistribution among bacteria, algae, crustaceans, and fish in the small-scale freshwater assay. Collectively, the use of well-characterized silver nanoparticles tuned for ion release will allow the PIs to tease apart the relative contribution of the nanoparticle and ion to biouptake, toxicity, and potential for environmental impacts.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a healing gel used to support tissue growth in wounds for people with diabetes and foot ulcers, as well as other wound-healing applications. The current market solution for foot ulcers in diabetics is a gel that has low success rates as the body breaks down the gel's proteins extremely fast. The proposed technology differs from the current solution in that it doesn't rely on proteins for wound healing, and thus the product doesn't get consumed by the body at such a rapid rate. Foot ulcers are a problem for 25% of the 34.2 million diabetics living in the United States. With the current option on the market, 25 percent of the ulcers become chronically infected, with 25 percent of those patients needing amputations. Even with amputation, 50 percent of amputees, 1.05 million people, die each year in the US from gangrene acquired with foot ulcers. A Market Research Report by BCC on Organ and Tissue Transplantation and Alternatives shows this innovation fits a global market reaching nearly $90.6 billion by 2020.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel biomaterial created using extracellular matrix materials isolated from ctenophores, which have highly regenerative properties. A material fabricated by laser to match a tissue's authentic architecture serves to guide cells to regenerate tissues into their original structure. The software controls cell growth and differentiation in the framework of a tissue's authentic extracellular matrix architecture within one of three novel bioreactor systems using peripheral devices that create environmental conditions promoting tissue regeneration. The inventions include two standalone systems used to hold and support bio-printed and/or laser-fabricated tissue constructs. The proposed technology produces molecular scaffolding for tissue regeneration using novel growth factor materials isolated from the extracellular matrix of ancestral tissues from ctenophore incorporated into molecular scaffolding to guide tissue regeneration.

"The future development of computers will likely depend on a qualitative change, with new technologies based on materials and mechanisms very different from those currently employed. One of the most promising alternatives centers on development of ultra-low-power cognitive computing systems inspired by the operating principles of the brain and employing new types of bio-inspired devices with functionalities which correspond to those of neurons, synapses, axons, and dendrites. This research project aims to enhance our understanding of fundamental processes of the electrically-induced switching mechanism in vanadium oxides and related materials. This knowledge will help to address the needs of high-density data storage, adaptive neural circuits, and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. In addition, this project will allow the PI and a graduate student to be trained at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation to apply techniques crucial to the central aspect of the research. Collaboration will ensure longer-term impacts and facilitate future access either through direct collaborations or through support from future research projects for use of the facilities by the PI. Participation by UPRM students in related sub-projects will be a unique educational opportunity for them directly, which will prepare them to address the challenges of electronic materials in the 21st century. 

This project pursues experiments to study correlated Magnéli vanadium oxides in purpose-built nanostructures with the goal of furthering our understanding of dynamics of the electrically-induced switching of Phase Change Materials exhibiting Metal Insulator Transition and how it depends on physical and chemical parameters such as composition, stress, thickness, grain size and orientation, and local morphology. A range of appropriate characterization techniques will be employed in order to study the properties of interest here. Beyond standard ones, state-of-the-art techniques will be applied, including in-operando photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. Elucidation of the influence of parameters mentioned above on the switching mechanism and on electroformed conductive filament formation are required to assess their relative importance and to develop fabrication protocols enabling reproducible electronic characteristics in prospective devices for neuromorphic computing.

"This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports research to advance the national health through research on effective screening strategies to detect asymptomatic infections and genetic diseases. The project has the potential to substantially improve health outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and diminish the spread of disease by significantly reducing the time and resources required to identify affected individuals. Partnering with the North Carolina State Laboratory of Public Health (NCSLPH), the project investigates pooling strategies for combining individual laboratory samples to measure the concentration of a disease-related marker. Pools that test positive for the disease marker then undergo follow-up testing to identify positive-testing individuals. Pooling is a highly efficient strategy but must be performed carefully so as to control for imperfect medical testing technologies, heterogeneous populations, dilution effects, variable disease progression, and other uncertainties in testing and disease parameters. This project will provide public health agencies with effective strategies to mitigate existing and emerging threats to communities and populations. 

This award supports fundamental research in operational methods to design effective and efficient sample-based screening strategies by exploring novel, rigorous approaches to pooled testing using an optimization framework. The framework will incorporate disease (marker) progression models, imperfect tests with continuous outcomes, pooling dilution effects, and demographic variables, including risk-factors, in a realistic manner. The framework will be used to study the effects of non-uniform screening policies, the impact of more accurate but costly test procedures, policy robustness, and measures of equity among screened subpopulations. By deriving structural properties of solutions to the resulting non-convex optimization problems, this research will generate insight and principles on the use of pooling. In collaboration with NCSLPH, pooling strategies will developed, calibrated, and validated for two of the most prevalent sexually-transmitted diseases in the United States. This research will advance the knowledge-base in pooled testing and fill critical voids in the literature, which spans operations research, bio-statistics, and medical decision-making, and in practice. Project discoveries will be broadly disseminated, new course material will be developed, and undergraduate and graduate students will interact with the team through research experiences and mentoring.

"This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the University of Wyoming (UW), located in Laramie WY, will bring seven community college (CC) students and two CC professors to UW each summer from 2021 to 2023. This program, jointly supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), will allow students and faculty to contribute to chemistry research on projects ranging from energy, to  materials, to bio-related topics. Each student will work closely with one of the participating faculty mentors who have been carefully selected for their research accomplishments and successful mentoring records with undergraduate researchers. This hands-on research experience also includes a variety of activities (seminars, mini-courses on ethics and writing, and energy-related field trips) to educate and train students for their future careers as scientists.

The higher education system in Wyoming is comprised of a single 4-year/graduate level university along with seven community colleges. This REU site emphasizes serving students and faculty from regional CCs to positively impact students and science in WY and surrounding states. This program will engage first and second-year undergraduates, who are early in their college career, and expose them to graduate level chemistry research. The wide range of projects offered includes the synthesis and characterization of nanoparticule-based catalysts; site-selective photochemical protein modification; and the chemistry of molecular hydrogen quantum crystals. On this latter project, it is worthy of note that cryogenic solid molecular hydrogen is a unique condensed phase environment due to a variety of quantum mechanical effects such as large amplitude translational zero point motion of the individual H molecules and the presence of ortho and para nuclear spin manifolds.  A variety of non-classical dynamics occur within such crystals at liquid helium temperatures. These research experiences will provide a more in-depth view of chemistry research and of perspective on potential job opportunities in the chemical sciences. The students in this program will also have opportunities for professional development including training in ethics, scientific communication, and preparation of resumes and graduate school application materials.

"This research will salvage and restore a biological research collection critical to understanding the southeastern US flora, make data of this collection widely accessible to researchers, and engage the next-generation of biodiversity scientists. The 20,000 specimen collection, the Lord Fairfax Community College herbarium (LFCC), deeply documents vascular plant species from a historically under-collected US region, the Blue Ridge physiographic province of northwestern Virginia. In 2019, Lord Fairfax Community College donated LFCC to the George Mason University herbarium (GMUF) to safeguard the collection for posterity. LFCC contains numerous high-quality specimens that represent newly discovered county- and state records that expand the Atlas of the Virginia Flora and the Flora of Virginia. Such information is essential for understanding the ecology and evolution of the southeastern US flora and for managing natural resources in one of the nation’s biodiversity hotspots, which is under increasing strain from human modification. This research will ensure that LFCC receives the repair and modern curation it desperately needs in order to be fully utilized as research infrastructure. The combination of LFCC and GMUF will create the third-largest herbarium in Virginia. The co-location of these significant research materials will increase their impact on biodiversity and ecological studies in Virginia and the southeastern US for the foreseeable future. 

The research project will use an efficient workflow to salvage LFCC and its detailed collection notebooks, digitize these data to share with the scientific community and the public at large, and educate students about the importance of natural history collections in scientific research. LFCC specimens will be repaired, annotated, and physically filed with those of GMUF under archival conditions. High-resolution images of LFCC specimens and their label metadata will be disseminated publicly through the SERNEC TCN Symbiota LFCC portal and iDigBio. In order to extend the impact of this research resource, the LFCC collection notebooks will also be digitized and linked to specimen records. Undergraduate students from underrepresented groups and one graduate student will be trained as curatorial assistants over the two-year project period. Project personnel will develop an educational module using LFCC specimens, whose goals are to develop undergraduate students’ awareness of collections’-based research and the extended specimen concept. Multiple outreach events are planned that will engage the broader university community and the public through the Notes from Nature online community science platform using the established Plants of Virginia herbarium label transcription project. A series of public presentations and articles about the results of the project are planned for academic and non-academic audiences.

"Although a growing body of research has pinpointed how strong social bonds improve survival and health across both human and nonhuman primates, the importance of social connections in early life has been comparatively understudied. This doctoral dissertation project will integrate behavioral, hormonal, and immune data to quantify early-life social bonds and assess their developmental consequences in a wild primate. By studying these connections in a nonhuman primate species, this research will provide comparative data for investigations of early-life social bonds in humans. The investigator will engage in mentorship and education programs both in the U.S. and abroad, mentoring undergraduates in crafting research projects, designing science programs for libraries in underserved neighborhoods, and leading conservation education activities with local communities.

This research project will examine the role of early-life social bonds in wild, juvenile gelada monkeys. Geladas inhabit complex societies in which immatures play with both familiar groupmates and unfamiliar neighbors. First, this project will determine whether maternal dominance rank, the number of close relatives, and the presence/absence of a sibling predict the quality and/or quantity of social bonds, taking into account potential sex differences in these patterns. Second, this project will examine whether strong bonds buffer juveniles from social adversity, reducing rates of received aggression, increasing alliances during competitive encounters, and decreasing physiological stress measures. Lastly, this project will investigate the stress response’s impact on both innate immunity and adaptive immunity. While social isolation and associated physiological stress may impair immune function wholesale, it may instead lead to trade-offs between these two sub-systems, prioritizing immediately beneficial, innate immune defenses.

"An unprecedented opportunity to advance understanding of the biological rules that govern the diversity and dynamics of life now exists thanks to the large quantity and variety of data that are becoming increasingly available.  This goal of understanding biodiversity dynamics is enabled at a critical moment when human systems are disrupting those very dynamics. However, the scientific and computational tools needed to derive understanding from data are still missing.  Such tools need to be accessible to a broad community of users, thereby catalyzing involvement and innovation.  This project will (1) build a computational model for multiple aspects of biodiversity-species abundance, genetic, functional, and phylogenetic; (2) use and refine this model by testing major hypotheses about the generation and maintenance of biodiversity in three exemplar systems; (3) make the model accessible to the scientific community by building an open-source platform to prepare diverse data sources and run the model; and (4) create pedagogically effective courses and workshops to enable students, researchers, and stakeholders from many backgrounds to understand biodiversity theory and the data science tools needed to test those theories with data.

The Rules of Life Engine (RoLE) model will be a mechanistic, simulation-based hypothesis-testing and data synthesis framework enabling scientists with multi-dimensional biodiversity data to generate and test hypotheses about the processes driving biodiversity patterns. The RoLE model will apply new techniques in machine learning to fit models to high dimensional, cross-scale data. The model will simulate eco-evolutionary community assembly building from individual-based ecological and genetic neutral models with added non-neutral, trait-based competition and environmental filtering. New species and traits will arise through long time scale evolution in the meta-community and rapid evolution in the local community. Population genetics and species abundances in the local community will be modeled through birth, death, immigration, and mutation. The project research team will refine and illustrate the use of the RoLE model by testing four hypothesized rules of life across three bio-geographic systems for which multi-scale biodiversity data are now available. The hypotheses address the relative roles of immigration versus speciation in community assembly, how species interactions influence diversity, how different assembly histories determine the strength of species interactions, and whether/how systems come to equilibrium. The project leaders have established a network of 14 collaborators, including the National Ecological Observatory Network, who will use the RoLE model in their diverse systems and propagate wider adoption. In order to further reduce barriers to use, the RoLE model framework will be made available as open source software, including an R language Shiny App interface with standardized metadata outputs to promote reproducibility and sharing. The insights gained from the RoLE model are of direct relevance to conservation, e.g., whether or not communities are assembled primarily by speciation or immigration strongly determines their response to anthropogenic pressures and optimal conservation management. To encourage participation in quantitative biodiversity research, the project leaders will develop a massively open online course through the Santa Fe Institute?s Complexity Explorer program using the RoLE model as an interactive teaching tool. In conjunction with Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry, the research team will also provide an in-person data science training workshop. Results from the RoLE project can be found at https://role-model.github.io.

"Behavior (how animals interact with other organisms and the environment) is critical for individual survival and reproduction, the persistence of populations/species, and the health of ecosystems. Behavioral studies seek to understand how and why animals act differently within and between populations, and to identify factors that drive the evolution of new behaviors. Yet while the current and historical distributions of species are an integral context for understanding behavioral evolution, they are often neglected in behavioral studies. Similarly, the field of biogeography ⎯ how and why biological diversity, or biodiversity, varies across the Earth ⎯ seeks to understand how biodiversity responds to natural and human-mediated change; however, such studies often do not take the behaviors that shape population- and species-level interactions into account. This project lays the foundation for developing an Institute focused on the biogeography of behavior, through the development of a shared and integrative framework for both fields that will enhance our understanding of behavioral evolution, conservation, and ecosystem processes. Activities undertaken by the Institute will include recruitment and training for students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty; development of formal case studies and activities for K-12 and undergraduate classrooms; implementation of a Broadening Bioinformatics Workshop geared towards high school students; and Institute planning activities and pilot projects. The Biogeography of Behavior Institute will merge expertise in the fields of animal behavior and biogeography to develop new empirical tests, mathematical models, and theory to enhance understanding of when and how organisms respond to rapidly changing environments.

Behavior is critical for individual fitness, and ultimately, species’ survival, and it is often an organisms’ immediate response to its biotic and abiotic environment. The historical and current geographic distributions of species are integral to understanding the evolution, development, function, and mechanisms of behavior, and behavior (dispersal, interactions within- and across-species, etc.) is in turn critical for understanding patterns in biogeography. Yet few studies of behavior integrate the biogeographic context and vice versa, leaving major gaps in our ability to interpret empirical results and develop novel hypotheses. The Biogeography of Behavior Institute will bring together scientists from multiple disciplines to develop a comprehensive foundation for integrating the fields of animal behavior and biogeography. Through such integration, the Institute will span questions from cellular to global scales, examining links between genotype and phenotype, adaptability and resiliency across communities, and developing predictions for shifts in populations in response to rapid environmental change. The Institute aims to 1) foster interactions among biologists working in the evolution, development, function, and mechanisms of animal behavior and biogeography, 2) design experiments to explore geographical aspects of behavior and vice versa, and 3) bring together specialists from multiple fields to directly address questions related to large-scale geographic shifts in species distributions or behavioral patterns resulting from climate change, urbanization, and habitat destruction.

"Brain disorders cost the US an estimated $800 billion each year. In general, the human brain cannot be experimented on directly. However, patient-sourced stem cells can be used to create organoids, which partially resemble the tissue of origin. Brain-derived organoids have proven to be helpful in understanding brain development and disease, but currently do not fully replicate the complexity and connectivity of the human brain. In this project, brain organoids will be engineered to more reliably develop into an interconnected network resembling the brain. The project tightly integrates research with education. It provides direct support for scientific outreach programs to Metro Nashville Public Schools and recruitment of high school students to participate in the research project. These efforts will help develop the next generation of scientists and STEM-career workers.

Brain organoid generation exploits the ability of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to integrate global and local morphogenetic cues to self-assemble and differentiate. Building brain organoids requires addition of external cues that activate or suppress specific signaling pathways. The hPSCs interpret this signaling cocktail through networks that establish internal gradients of morphogen agonists and antagonists. Signaling centers coordinate embryo development. Without them, organoid production can lead to inconsistencies in size, shape, and cellular organization. These features must be faithfully replicated in brain organoids. The goal of this project is to establish the molecular logic and design rules required to generate cerebral cortical organoids. The objective is to create a self-contained system with reproducible and defined architecture, size, and cellular composition. Rewiring cellular networks will direct cells to autonomously respond to their microenvironment. These cells will reproducibly template early corticogenesis while balancing progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation during later stages. The principles uncovered will guide the utilization of brain organoids for understanding development and disease, and for screening potential therapeutics. Understanding the design rules that govern higher-order structure formation in the brain may potentially be applied to other types of tissues. This further opens the possibility of engineering tissue replacements for transplantation.

"Developing tissue grafts and models from stem cells is a complex process. Mimicking the structure and function of natural tissue requires coordination of signals from many cell types. How these signals interact to direct development of complex tissues is not well understood, and effective predictive tools are lacking. The goal of this project is to monitor, model, and modulate the differentiation of stem cells to produce tissues. This project will provide a clearer picture of dynamic tissue development and new tools to predict and manipulate stem cell fate. This will lead to a strategy for engineering of accurate and reproducible tissues, leading to improved tissue engineered therapies and better models for drug development. This project will involve undergraduate research experiences, a capstone design component, a student summer internship program, and an industry immersion program for graduate students. 

This RECODE project will apply a systems reverse engineering of stochasticity (SRES) approach to monitor, model, and modulate heterotypic co-differentiation of progenitor cells in 3D organoids. SRES will advance the science which underlies the co-differentiation of cells in complex tissues. Crucial to this project is the development of nanoscale biosensors providing dynamic multigene expression analysis in single cells within complex heterotypic organoids. Spatiotemporal differentiation marker expression, combined with proliferation measures in sorted populations will be monitored. The data will be used to develop stochastic agent-based models of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) function and differentiation. The models will predict the relative proportions of osteogenic, endotheliogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages based on multiplexed stimuli, and be updatable using real-time biosensor data. The predictive models will be tested by modulating heterotypic differentiation trajectories with temporally controlled siRNA differentiation factors to create heterotypic bone and cartilage organoids. This new knowledge will provide a systematic means for engineering heterotypic 3D tissue models necessary for realizing intricate skeletal architectures. The technical goals of the project are to: (i) develop new multiplex real-time intracellular reporters for differentiation markers, (ii) develop stochastic models of progenitor cell proliferation and fate based on dynamic differentiation marker expression and (iii) validate the agent-based stochastic models of organoid development using siRNA targeting pathways known to de novo regulate differentiation.

"Geological and paleontological research provides a deep-time perspective of past events that can inform scientists and policymakers about the long-term consequences of environmental patterns. Of particular interest to both scientists and the general public is the relationship between environmental change and hominin evolution. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how shifts in the environment may have played a role in the origins of two major lineages of hominins, Paranthropus and Homo. By examining how the environments in which these early hominins lived changed leading up to the divergence of Paranthropus and Homo, this project provides important evidence of the impact of environment variability on a local scale, as well as insight into the evolutionary drivers that spurred the emergence of new hominin lineages. A critical goal of this project is to train a female graduate student in STEM and to create opportunities for other women and students from underrepresented groups to gain first-hand experience in conducting science through mentorship and research. It also fosters international research collaborations and academic linkages and public science outreach and engagement. 

The origin and divergence of the Paranthropus and Homo lineages coincides with a period of profound environmental variability and instability at the regional and local levels. To understand the contributing factors that may have precipitated this major evolutionary event, it is important to determine the environmental context in which the two new lineages emerged. However, the nature of the relationship between global and local-scale environmental change remains poorly resolved during this critical period of human evolution. The goal of this project is to investigate the underlying environmental factors potentially driving the emergence of Paranthropus and Homo by (1) using mesowear, microwear and stable isotope analyses to reconstruct the local paleoenvironment; (2) comparing paleoenvironmental data from other sites in the region to document patterns of local environmental change; and (3) investigating the relationship between environmental change and the extinction and speciation of hominins and other mammals.

"Humans thrive in diverse and extreme environments around the world thanks to biological and social mechanisms including adaptation by natural selection, habitat construction, and cultural innovations. While many studies have investigated the genetic basis of adaptation to extreme environments, there is much to be discovered about how social and cultural processes also interact to contribute to human survival and flourishing. This doctoral dissertation project combines genetic, archaeological, ethnohistorical, and ethnographic analyses to investigate adaptation through time to both natural and social environmental pressures. The multifaceted approach of this project will advance the understanding of human adaptation as well as expand the currently limited representation of Indigenous peoples of the Americas in genomic studies of human variation. The project provides mentorship and training in anthropological genomic methods to graduate and undergraduate researchers and contributes to community and public science outreach efforts.

This project employs biocultural theoretical frameworks to integrate evidence from archaeology, ethnohistory, ethnography, and genomics and develop a more complete and nuanced picture of human survival and flourishing in extreme environments. The study employs next-generation genome sequencing technology, isotope and radiocarbon analyses, statistical tests for natural selection, and reconstructions of population history to assess genetic variation and identify genes under selection in ancient and contemporary Indigenous peoples over a timespan of about six thousand years. These data will be used to shed light on possible parallel adaptation in extreme environments where cold temperatures and limited diets may have had similar effects on human populations. Additionally, this study will investigate adaptation after European contact when the introduction of novel diseases may have acted as a strong selective pressure.

"In nonhuman primate communities, between-species competition is hypothesized to dictate species diversity and community assemblages, but there is often a lack of fine-resolution data on species interactions. This doctoral dissertation project will use innovative methods to examine the relative influences of competition and niche differentiation on the structure of a community of four nocturnal lemurs from Madagascar. Species ecologies will be described in dietary, spatial, and temporal dimensions. The project will provide extant models for identifying driving forces in primate community evolutionary history as well as critical data for informed, targeted protection of endangered lemur species. The investigator will work with local NGOs to encourage sustainable development projects in the study region. Additionally, the investigator will engage women undergraduates, including from underrepresented groups, to work on arthropod curation and laboratory analyses and will visit high schools to give lectures about conservation and career paths for women in science.  

Competition is a primary mechanism underlying current community assemblages, particularly in sympatric, closely related species. The evolutionary history of lemurs was likely defined by such competition, resulting in pronounced niche differentiation, which allowed for coexistence in sympatric lemur communities. However, these concepts remain to be rigorously tested due to a lack of fine-resolution data regarding between-species interactions within lemur communities. To fully understand these processes, the investigator will combine innovative technologies, such as DNA metabarcoding, with traditional methods, such as transect surveys, to conduct a fine-resolution analysis of the relative influences of competition and niche differentiation on the structure of a sympatric community of nocturnal lemurs. Specifically, the investigator will evaluate: 1) niche differentiation and interspecific competition as governing forces of current cheirogaleid community structure, 2) which niche dimensions (i.e., diet, space, or time) most greatly facilitate coexistence and drive competition in this community, and 3) how niche differentiation shifts in response to seasonal variation (as some species exhibit hibernation/daily torpor during the dry season). Fine-resolution niche differentiation (i.e., differentiation that would have been undetectable using only traditional methods) is hypothesized to be responsible for the development and maintenance of the current assemblage of the study community.

"Insects rely on odor-guided flapping flight to mate and hunt for prey. They navigate by tracking odor trails in complex flow environments to detect and locate distant targets. During this odor-guided navigation, the flapping wings serve for force production and actively draw odor plumes towards the antennae via wing-induced flow. It is hypothesized that the “flapping” used by insects serves the same function as the “sniffing” in mammals for enhancing olfactory detection. Understanding how insects achieve the balance between aerodynamic performance and olfactory sensitivity is the stepping stone towards transforming this feat in engineering solutions for the navigation of miniature aerial vehicles in GPS-denied environments, with important applications for search in natural disasters, chemical leaking monitoring, and drug trafficking detection. To this end, the objective of this project is to establish a physics-driven understanding of the odor-tracking flapping flight in nature. The project also encompasses a variety of education and outreach activities to promote diversity in engineering and strengthen the future STEM workforce.

The underlying fluid dynamic principles of olfactory searching in nature remain largely unknown. This project will test the hypothesis that the enhancement of the olfactory sensitivity during navigation can be achieved by regulating the odorant transport in unsteady wing-induced flow through modulating flapping locomotion. A combined high-fidelity computational simulation and theoretical treatment will be used to examine the unsteady flow generated by flapping wings and its associated odorant transport process. The application of a novel computational fluid dynamics-informed simultaneous localization and mapping will be used to explore the odor-tracking algorithms in flying insects. The research will reveal the overarching fluid dynamic mechanisms of odor-guided navigation in nature after the completion of three specific aims: 1) characterize the unsteady aerodynamics and odorant transport in odor-tracking flights; 2) determine the influences of wing-induced unsteady flow on the spatiotemporal distribution of odor plume structures; 3) elucidate the interactions between the unsteady flow and odorant transport during navigation. The findings will advance the development of design principles for bio-inspired flying robots with superior aerodynamic performance and olfactory sensitivity.

"Microbiomes consist of diverse microorganisms and viruses that exist in every environment on Earth ranging from the deep ocean to human skin. Microbiomes are highly complex since they contain hundreds to thousands of members and change as a function of time, space and environmental context. By compartmentalizing functions in different organisms and coordinating these activities, microbial communities can perform bio-transformations more efficiently than single populations. Environmental perturbations can alter the composition and functions of microbiomes. Microbiome engineering aims to design targeted interventions to predictably alter microbiome properties or wire together interacting microbial strains with desired functions from the bottom-up for biotechnological, agricultural and therapeutic applications. It is within this framework that the 3rd International Conference on Microbiome Engineering is designed. The conference will occur December 7-8, 2020 making use of a virtual delivery platform. This international conference brings in experts in industry and academia worldwide to discuss the challenges in microbiome engineering and the future of the field. The conference is the third in the series, following the success of the previous ones held in 2018 and 2019. The 3rd International Conference on Microbiome Engineering provides a venue for: (1) Scientific presentations from a diverse group of researchers on an interactive virtual platform, (2) Encouraging active participation by graduate and undergraduate researchers who represent the future of the field, (3) Bringing scientists and engineers together to provide an atmosphere and venue to discuss their disciplines and approaches, and to motivate new research directions that would overcome barriers limiting the development of microbiome modeling and engineering. (4) Focus on increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.

The 3rd International Conference on Microbiome Engineering aims to create a platform for the sharing of groundbreaking knowledge in the field. The conference draws attendees from academia as well as industry to allow new knowledge from the laboratory to potentially be utilized to manufacture new products. The conference allows for active participation with question and answer sessions as well as a panel discussion. The networking opportunities at the conference allow attendees to exchange their ideas and fosters an environment for future collaborations.

"Non Technical Abstract: 

     This convergent research project seeks to create new advanced technologies to address the increasing demand for faster, smaller, more efficient integrated circuits by utilizing a protein-based fiber (termed a “PA”) for more effective electron transport. The results of such work will open the door for a new wave of electronic materials with advanced circuitry characteristics and capabilities, allowing many of the electronics used each day such as cell phones, televisions, and microwaves to become more efficient, compact, and powerful. Currently, in a simple electronic system, the wire’s only function is to serve as the highway for electrons between transistors or switches. This project will create a new type of electronics containing wires made from the biologically-based PA materials. Rather than just serve as a connector, this new ‘biological wire’ would be an active component of the circuit, directing electron flow between components while also processing information. This is of significant practical value as the additional functionality would allow us to scale down, reducing components and transistors, while saving power and costs. The educational component seeks to develop a pathway for scientists to use their expertise to affect change on a global scale by training them to be active in science-policy. Through a combination of coursework and internships within the federal government students will see how their science is used to improve people’s lives and how they can use their technical expertise to help the government more effectively carry out its goals. The award will support the careers and training of the PI (an early career scientist and former AAAS Science and Technology Policy fellow), and a diverse cross-section of students from high school through graduate level of study across various scientific disciplines. The PI and his group will also mentor local undergraduate and high school students through George Mason's highly competitive Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program, connecting a new generation of students to bench science. The project’s components will involve biochemistry, physics, engineering and policy, providing students with a thorough training regime.

Technical Abstract: 

The Solomon group proposes to use Peptide Amphiphiles (PAs) to study biological electron transport, which underlies a host of functions from mineral cycling to bioremediation. No sufficient biomimetic model systems exist to study these processes, but one is needed to isolate the core chemical and biophysical principles that drive these functions. PAs are short peptides connected to a lipid tail that polymerize into long fiber structures and bind the natural cofactor heme B. Due to their simple structure and polymeric character, minute changes are amplified and the core biophysical principles are readily observable, and their synthetic character allows those functions to be exploited in non-natural contexts. Aim one focuses on the peptide; the amino-acid sequence will be changed to measure how different cofactor environments affect electron transport. Aim two will focus on the lipid, which will be modified such that these PA fibers can self-assemble into discrete sections leading to electrochemical interfaces and gradients. In aim three, heme will be replaced with other redox cofactors to impart new electrochemical functions. Combining the results of these aims will produce a multifunctioning PA fiber that can uncover the core biophysical aspects of many biological electron transport functions. Additionally, these materials will be developed into electrical wires that incorporate decision-making peptide components and process information, which could lead to new types of bio circuitry with improved computing power. Dr. Solomon’s educational component aims to develop a science-policy curriculum for graduate students. This certificate program will be built around a combination of lecture material to explain the workings of the government and an internship component where students will apply their scientific training directly to the policy making process. This program will improve student’s understanding of how their work can be integrated into federal policy and improve the government by seeding offices with technical expertise not currently available.

"Primate species display a diverse range of adaptations for moving through their environments, and hypotheses about these locomotor patterns have long played a central role in models of primate origins. In this project, the investigators will use an integrative set of analytical techniques to (1) explore the correlation of “leaping related” skeletal traits with leaping performance and (2) assess the evolutionary implications of the resulting correlations in the primate fossil record. This approach is designed to provide validated evidence capable of supporting or refuting the hypothesis that selection for powerful arboreal leaping characterized early primate locomotion. Utilizing research facilities at the Duke Lemur Center and the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (CMZ), this study will contribute to the debate on the relevance of leaping behavior during early primate evolution by providing quantitative biomechanical data on leaping performance in 19 species of extant primates. The project will enhance K-12 education and outreach via the involvement of high school research interns at Northeast Ohio Medical University and Duke University, as well as public outreach efforts through the teaching of a short course on primate locomotor biomechanics at a local STEM academy and public science events at the CMZ, Duke University’s Darwin Day, and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Science. The project will also provide research training and opportunities for undergraduates, female graduate students, and a postdoctoral fellow. 

Differing hypotheses about ancestral primate locomotion have long generated strong debate about the predominant selective pressures acting during primate origins. Recent paleontological analyses have been interpreted to suggest that selection for improved leaping was particularly critical during early primate evolution. Hypotheses about the paleobiology of ancestral primates are constrained by a limited understanding of the functional significance of morphological variation in extinct lineages, as fossils currently provide only imprecise clues about behavioral capacity. Robust correlations between morphology and performance are needed to more precisely infer locomotor transitions during primate origins from the anatomical transformations revealed by fossils. Fortunately, leaping biomechanics are relatively easy to characterize, making this a particularly tractable locomotor behavior to study. This research is organized into two specific aims. (AIM 1) Investigators will use high-speed video and force plates to study leaping performance in a diverse sample of extant primates, squirrels, and treeshrews. These data will be combined with morphometric datasets to test hypotheses relating variation in leaping performance to variation in skeletal morphology. (AIM 2) Armed with a deeper understanding of the functional morphology of leaping performance, investigators will use phylogenetic comparative analyses and evolutionary modeling to investigate the selective importance of leaping at the origin of crown primates and during their subsequent evolution. This two-pronged approach will ground interpretations of primate “leaping” morphology with transformational functional specificity, permitting assessment of how morphological changes in the primate fossil record quantitatively affected leaping performance and informing long-standing debates on the ecological context of primate origins.  This project is jointly supported by the NSF SBE-BCS-Biological Anthropology and BIO-IOS-Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics programs.

"Primates depend heavily on plants resources for food in subtropical and tropical forests. However, the way in which overall forest structure and function is related to primate ecology and behavior is not fully understood. Tree species differ in their traits, some of which affect plant growth and survival (e.g., leaf mass), while others (e.g., fruit sugars) negative or positively affect primates. A ""trait landscape"" results from tree species' spatial distributions and traits, including phenological activity (e.g., flowering). This doctoral dissertation project examines how the constellation of plant traits in forests that primates inhabit affect primate diet, nutrition, and mating patterns such as monogamy. This project contributes to professional development and STEM education of undergraduates and assistants from local communities. International collaborators, including students and assistants, will obtain hands-on training in canopy access techniques, drone remote sensing, and programming using Python. The project will also support K-12 curriculum development and primate conservation in the study region. 

The goal of this project is to identify important ecological correlates of primate diet and monogamous mating system, by carefully considering and incorporating the bottom-up roles of plant traits and the spatiotemporal details of forest ecology and composition. Specifically, the project will examine the bottom-up effects of a tree community’s spatiotemporal distribution of functional and trophic effect traits on the nutritional ecology and mating pattern of Azara's owl monkey (Aotus azarae azarae). The researchers will (1) consider the owl monkeys' diet and nutritional ecology in a forest ecology context by considering the functional ecology/trait space of the tree community, and juxtapose their findings with those of traditional nutritional ecology analyses, and (2) assess how and why functional and trophic effect traits are equally distributed over space and time in gallery forests, with pair-living and a monogamous mating system as corollaries. The researchers will collect standardized plant samples and analyze these for functional traits, nutrients, and plant secondary compounds. They will furthermore assess the spatiotemporal details of species distribution and phenology through drone remote sensing, and statistically analyze spatial, nutritional, and community ecology parameters.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to predict a patient’s risk for developing an adverse and often lethal response to certain viral infections, such as COVID-19. This project proposes a fast and accurate test for the severity of COVID-19 infection.  The proposed assay has the potential to enable early intervention and save lives. It can potentially be used for many other infections and public health hazards beyond COVID-19.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will produce a new technology capable of diagnosing immune response dysregulation to any infectious disease (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, dengue, influenza, hepatitis C, etc.) that progress through an antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) mechanism. While infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus begins as a mild illness, some patients experience a sudden and rapid decline in health, precipitated by a massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e., a “cytokine storm,” Cytokine storms cause hyperinflammation of the lungs, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the leading cause of COVID-19 mortality. Unfortunately, there is presently no test capable of predicting this event. This project aims to fill this medical technology gap via the development of a highly multiplexed, rapid, sensitive, disposable immunoassay specific to COVID-19 infections to be deployed at scale. The effort will include designing, building, and optimizing a prototype immunoassay based on nanopore technology innovations and analytically validating the developed technology against industry standards.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the creation of a sensor system for cell-based manufacturing of such products as biologic therapies, food ingredients, and bio-based materials. These sensors will overcome current limitations for tracking critical cell growth data, which requires manual sampling with slow turnaround times.  This system will enable better predictive growth models for improved production process development and will lead to better decision-making on cell type and culture conditions to produce biologic material. Better performance at this stage leads to potentially significant savings during the manufacturing lifetime of the drug.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on developing a wireless sensor system to address the need of continuously monitoring viable cell density during biomanufacturing. Many industries use cells for production, but the initial focus is upstream development of cell therapies and biologics. Central to this development is tracking the growth of cells in a variety of small-scale, single-use bioreactors to determine key event points for feed and harvest. Current methods rely on infrequent sampling and off-line counting due to the volume required, risk of contamination, and cost. The central research objective is to develop methods for standardized sensor and reader fabrication and quality testing for calibration studies in commercially-relevant environments and systems.  The proposed project will develop: 1) sensor stickers that are applied to the exterior of culture vessels, 2) readers that interrogate the sensor, and 3) algorithms to convert the sensor signal to cell count and push notifications to operators.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable the discovery of new therapeutics targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GCPRs). GPCRs are expressed in nearly every organ system, are accessible due to their location on the membrane and potential to elicit almost every signaling pathway. Drugs targeting GPCRs make up 35% of all FDA approved drugs, generating sales of more than $200 billion annually.  Despite relative success in pharmacologically targeting GPCRs they remain vastly underexploited, largely due to the lack of technology that addresses the characteristics and signaling patterns of GPCRs. The proposed project will explore the potential of GPCRs to help develop new drug candidates. 

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project leverages genetically encoded fluorescent GPCR sensor technology to address several challenging but necessary characteristics of GPCR targeted drug discovery: selectivity despite close sequence and structural homology, precise signal modulation within the continuum of receptor activation/ deactivation states and downstream signaling, in many cases the absence of a known endogenous ligand, and the ability to monitor compound activity (pharmacodynamics) directly in vivo in real-time. The proposed technology reflects ligand-dependent changes in GPCR conformation in real-time and directly reports ligand-receptor interactions, the primary determinant of signal generation in continuum. The technology can be readily implemented in high-throughput formats and universally adapted for a broad exploration of all GPCR targets. GPCR sensor technology provides unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution critical for in vivo analysis and enables precise measurements of the dynamic changes of receptor conformation. Therefore, it is well suited for the exploration of functionally selective compounds. Furthermore, by harnessing the sensitivity and selectivity of GPCR sensor technology, compounds that activate allosteric receptor sites through heterodimerization can be discovered. Ultimately, compounds discovered using the GPCR sensor technology are expected to be more clinically efficacious and therapeutically effective.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to provide U.S. hospitals with a tool to help accurately predict the expected severity of illness for COVID-19 infected patients at the time of initial diagnosis. A simple interface uses Artificial Intelligence-based predictive algorithms to help hospitals make informed and accurate decisions about which patients require specific care and treatment interventions. This enhanced process allows hospitals better and faster decision-making on patient care and treatments, redirecting hospital resources (including staff, hospital beds, ICU) for maximum effectiveness. In the longer term, the platform can be adapted to predict illnesses related to other infectious diseases, and also scaled for countries where availability of hospital infrastructure is limited.

This Small Business Technology (STTR) Phase I project will develop a completely new category of medical diagnostic and prognostic tools via a novel approach that relies on analysis of a complex multi-variate signal, reflective of the patient’s entire salivary metabolome and proteome. Artificial intelligence tools will be used to see if signal clusters correlating with patient outcomes can be identified. This is a radical departure from traditional medical diagnostics which evaluate individual biomarkers for a clinical diagnosis. Such approaches are ill suited to the task of predicting future patient outcomes. The scope of this pilot phase work is the development of an effective algorithm and understanding algorithm efficacy and reliability in prediction and classification of outcomes for COVID-19 patients. The goals of the pilot project are to: (i) obtain COVID-19 patient bio-fluid samples, and (ii) develop machine learning techniques for an effective predictive algorithm. Multiple machine learning techniques and comparison strategies will be used for algorithm development and efficacy testing.

"The colobine monkeys, a group of primates closely related to apes and humans, are species-rich and widespread globally.  Despite an abundant fossil record demonstrating a greater ecological and geographic range in the past, their evolution remains poorly understood.  This project will first determine the evolutionary relationships between the fossil and living colobines, then use these newly understood relationships to test long-standing hypotheses about the evolution of colobine habitats, diet, distribution, and diversity. Using newer methods and including recently described fossil material will provide a much-needed update on colobine evolution from earlier analyses and contribute significantly to our broader understanding of primate evolution.  The methods used in this project will be evaluated for their applicability to other areas of primate evolution as well, including early human evolution.  This project will also provide multiple opportunities for mentorship and public outreach by using charismatic primates to discuss primate biology, human evolution, and evolutionary theory more broadly.  Outreach will continue at events hosted by New York City public schools, CUNY colleges, and the American Museum of Natural History and research opportunities related to this project for high school, undergraduate, and master's students will be provided, emphasizing broadly applicable skills in computer coding, statistical analysis, critical thinking, and research design.  All products of this project, including raw data and computer program scripts, will be made available in public repositories to encourage further work on these relatively under-studied primates. 

This project will explore the evolutionary history of the colobine monkeys, a widespread and diverse primate radiation.  In contrast to the primarily folivorous and arboreal extant colobines, fossil colobines are known from a wider geographic range and exhibit a range of inferred substrate preferences and ecologies.  However, the evolutionary context of this diversity is largely unknown as the relationships between the fossil and living colobines are still poorly understood.  This project will first conduct a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the living and fossil colobine monkeys and subsequently use the inferred tree(s) to explore long-held hypotheses about 1) the evolution of substrate use, 2) the number, timing, and route of dispersals between continents, and 3) the pattern and timing of colobine diversification in the context of Mio-Pliocene climatic events.  Fossil and extant colobines will be scored for phylogenetic analysis and a set of functional postcranial measurements will also be taken.  Parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses will be performed on both the morphological data only and in total-evidence analyses incorporating molecular data.  A Bayesian tip-dated tree will be generated and used to explore changes in diversity through time, examining possible correlations with major climatic events.  Biogeographic history and the evolution of substrate preference will be explored by mapping character state changes and inferring ancestral states using both parsimony optimization and Bayesian modeling.  Character matrices and program codes will be made available to allow the incorporation of this work into a broader understanding of Mio-Pliocene catarrhine evolution.

"The global glass manufacturing industry is a principal economic enterprise which was estimated by Global Market Insights at $238.39 billion in 2018 and is growing. Glass has specific and useful properties including its 100% recyclability embodying sustainable manufacturing. Multifunctional glass surfaces are essential in the areas of optics, photonics, electronics, biochemical sensing, micro/nanofluidics, optofluidics, and biomedicine. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to provide needed knowledge for creating self-cleaning, anti-fogging rough glass surfaces while maintaining good optical properties. This laser-based surface texturing technology is highly scalable with a potential throughput of over 10 m2/hour allowing for commercialization and application in industry. This technology could have a direct impact on society, by enabling cost-effective and fast manufacturing of self-cleaning and anti-fogging windows, vehicle shields, eyeglasses, electronic device screens, face shields for medical personnel, among other functionalized surfaces. The program supports interdisciplinary research and education opportunities to both graduate and undergraduate students. An “Art of Bio-Inspired Manufacturing” program will be developed for Artisphere Fine Art festival to inspire the younger generation’s interest in manufacturing. 

Ultrafast laser structuring of glass surfaces has potential to create surface texturing at multiple length scales. There are currently knowledge gaps including the formation process of newly discovered structures, unclear structure formation mechanisms, inability to fabricate hierarchical structures, and lack of structure geometry control. This CAREER project bridges these knowledge gaps by establishing the fundamental understanding of multiscale surface structure formation on glass by ultrafast lasers. Experimental studies will be conducted to elucidate the formation mechanisms of ultrafast laser-induced nano-ripples and newly discovered micro-ripples. A multiscale hybrid numerical model will be developed to gain further insights about the surface structure formation and be validated by experimental data. The underlying physics of creating hierarchical structures on glass surfaces will be explored by both experimental study and numerical simulation. A double scanning method will be created to fabricate both microscale and nanoscale two-dimensional structures on glass surfaces manipulating surface color effects. The optical and wetting properties resulting from different surface structures will be characterized, and the process-structure-property relationship will be disclosed for this technique. The outcome of this project will not only advance the understanding of surface structure formation in dielectrics and other materials, but also be readily transferrable to other laser manufacturing processes, such as laser ablation, micro/nanomachining, and laser-induced plasma.

"The recent discovery of the hominin species Homo naledi has introduced new complexity and new questions about human evolution. In this doctoral dissertation project, the investigator will use 3D scanning technology to quantify skeletal variation across a number of H. naledi individuals and situate the results in a broader comparative primate context. Beyond providing an evolutionary context for the variation in H. naledi, this project will highlight the relationship between genetic and skeletal variation at multiple scales, which may be used to identify related individuals within bioarchaeological, forensic, and paleoanthropological assemblages. The research will generate hundreds of 3D models of three primate species, which will be made available to the public, creating new educational materials that can be 3D printed and used for lesson plans and outreach. Additionally, through close collaborations with local and international universities, undergraduates with interests in 3D imaging will continue to engage in independent research projects using these scans.

It is not known whether the recently discovered H. naledi individuals represent part of a small, isolated population or a larger, geographically diverse species that may have interacted with modern humans. In this project, the variation between H. naledi individuals will be quantified using 3D geometric morphometric assessment of five postcranial elements. Comparative modern human and chimpanzee samples containing individuals of known and unknown biological relationships will be used as baselines to explore variation at multiple scales. To this end, this project has three objectives: 1) to test the hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between genetic and morphological distance at and below the population level in modern humans and chimpanzees; 2) to quantify the variation within H. naledi and compare it to the variation calculated for modern humans and chimpanzees; and 3) to contextualize this variation by determining the extent to which H. naledi resembles biological relatives. A number of evolutionary scenarios concerning population isolation and relative size will be evaluated to determine which scenario most likely produced the variation seen in H. naledi. In so doing, this project will shed light on H. naledi’s evolutionary history and the possibility of interaction between H. naledi and modern humans.

"This Biology Integration Institute will use the tools of remote sensing and spectral biology to develop new techniques for measuring individual plants and landscape vegetation so as to understand the causes and consequences of biodiversity change. Biodiversity loss and climate change are major global crises that threaten humanity’s life support systems and its ability to cope with major challenges. It has never been more important for us to bring together our knowledge of life’s diversity from cells to continents to better understand the causes and consequences of its change for the biological processes that impact our well-being. As the biological sciences have become increasingly fragmented, new ways to integrate biological processes across scales are needed to understand the basis of Earth's life support systems. Spectral biology takes advantage of the way that energy interacts with matter to reveal immense amounts of information about the chemistry, structure, function, and evolution of plants. The project harnesses the technology and platforms now available, such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)—and those emerging even at the global scale with forthcoming satellites—to quantify building blocks of life at every biological scale using the same currency: photons from the sun that are reflected by plants. While doing so, the Institute will train the next generation of diverse and integrative biologists, including the mentoring of young scientists from marginalized groups. It will focus on engaging Native American communities, K-12 teacher training, and public outreach through Market Science modules, Minute Earth videos, a museum exhibit and public engagement and educational activities through the Bell Museum of Natural History, the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve (CCESR), and the Wisconsin Tribal Conservation Association.

The Institute will investigate the causes and consequences of plant biodiversity across scales in a rapidly changing world, from genes and molecules within cells and tissues to communities, ecosystems, landscapes and the biosphere. The Institute focuses on plant biodiversity, defined broadly to encompass the heterogeneity within life that occurs from the smallest to the largest biological scales. A premise of the Institute is that life is envisioned as occurring at different scales nested within several contrasting conceptions of biological hierarchies, defined by the separate but related fields of physiology, evolutionary biology, and ecology. The Institute will emphasize the use of spectral biology and process-oriented predictive models to investigate the ways that biological components at one scale give rise to emergent properties at higher scales by addressing five themes: 
   Theme 1. The genetic and environmental (i.e., GxE) drivers of trait variation at the leaf and whole plant scale linked by transcriptomic, metabolic and morphological variation; 
   Theme 2. How evolution generates the functional and spectral variation across the tree of life and its utility for biodiversity detection; 
   Theme 3. How functionally and spectrally distinct taxa, sampled across the tree of life, interact locally, leading to the assembly and dynamics of communities at multiple spatial scales, under current and future environmental conditions; 
   Theme 4. The consequences of biodiversity for ecosystem functioning and its response to global change; 
   Theme 5. How to improve parameterization of tissue- to ecosystem-scale properties at various spatial scales and advance land surface models that incorporate plant functional diversity. 
The Institute will integrate biology in new ways by harnessing the potential of spectral biology, experiments, observations, and synthetic modeling in a manner never before possible to transform understanding of how variation within and among biological scales drives plant and ecosystem responses to global change over diurnal, seasonal, and millennial time scales. In doing so, the institute will use and advance state-of-the-art theory.

"This doctoral dissertation project examines how competition affects primate adaptive processes, testing the central hypothesis that primates respond to competition over food resources by focusing feeding on underutilized resources. Using measures of tooth shape to analyze traits, and stable isotope analysis to examine diet and canopy use, this project looks at differences between primate pairs by comparing populations that live together to populations that live separately. The study can provide new information relevant to conservation management programs to prevent further primate extinction by documenting the impacts of increased competition due to habitat loss. Data collected for this project create undergraduate internship opportunities and provide training in the protocols and procedures of conducting original research. Results from this research will be incorporated into learning modules based on the themes of primate diet and conservation. These learning modules will be utilized by a local non-profit educational programming group that provides scientific activities to elementary and middle school students. 

This project asks two research questions: 1) do closely-related primate species focus their diet on a few key food items when they live together compared to the same species when they occur separately? and 2) do closely-related primate species display morphological traits and isotopic signatures that reflect focus on fewer key resources when they live together compared to the same species when they occur separately? These questions will be tested using ecometric measures to quantify tooth shape and stable isotope data to represent diet and canopy use. By combining methods to analyze tooth shape and isotopic signatures related to habitual canopy level occupation, this project will provide new perspectives on how to reconstruct dietary behaviors and resource competition.

"This workshop convenes leaders in electronic materials, devices, and systems to discuss emerging opportunities in semiconductors and related materials and their integration within electronic and photonic systems. Semiconductors have long been at the core of electronic systems and permeate modern life. The versatility of semiconductor materials and devices has led to continuous opportunities for innovation and technology development. Semiconductors constitute a broad range of devices in computers, cell phones, lasers, lighting, solar cells, medical diagnostics, and the internet. Continued American leadership in semiconductor technology is essential to maintain national security and defense, and foster economic growth. This workshop is aimed to develop a vision for directed research in future innovations in semiconductors and related materials to promote continued U.S. leadership in this critical sector.

The Future of Semiconductors and Beyond Workshop will promote discussion around four topical areas with significant potential for innovation and future applications. These are: (1) Harnessing electronic phases and phase transitions, (2) Engineering heterogeneous semiconductor structures, (3) Extending device frontiers, and (4) Advancing organic/biodevices. Topic (1) builds on our increased understanding of how to control “phase transitions” in semiconductors that lend them new functionality such as superconductor or ferroelectric behavior, thus enabling new applications, and improvement in speed and energy efficiency. Topic (2) will explore new insights into forming heterogeneous semiconductor materials in ways that are not compromised by the traditional challenges of material defects, interfaces and surfaces. Topic (3) will address unsolved problems in signal transduction and optoelectronic devices in the far infrared and ultraviolet spectral regions. This is a space with broad applications extending from defense to medical diagnostics. Finally, Topic (4) will focus on the intersection of semiconductor devices and biological sensing and control. Themes of interest include flexible semiconductor form-factors and bio-compatibility.  The topical sessions will address both future visions and grand challenges, as these can serve to generate innovation and collaborations leading to rapid advances in science and engineering. The virtual workshop format will enable wide participation and stimulation of ideas across a diverse community and these will be summarized in a final report of the workshop findings.

"Unsteady flow fields are common in many underwater applications, such as during high sea conditions, in a propeller wake, during cooperative swimming or during tides, and waves. In such environments, hovering, station keeping, or performing any other dynamic maneuvers become extremely difficult for traditional autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) because they are typically designed with rigid hydrofoils within a fixed operational envelope. However, aquatic swimmers can aptly morph their fins and tails to control unsteady forces across all positions and orientations. Engineers can design highly maneuverable next-generation AUVs with bio-inspired morphing hydrofoils which can mimic such performance. But a major bottleneck has been the lack of knowledge of unsteady hydrodynamics that govern the fluid-structure interaction of such morphing lifting surfaces. Therefore, the principal aim of this project is to provide a deep understanding of the unsteady hydrodynamics of adaptive lifting surfaces. This project will also promote advanced education of marine hydrodynamics and underwater robotics amongst students at all level, including outreach activities at the Orlando Science Center and the Orange County Public Library.

The goal of this proposal is to develop new research and educational paradigm that will reveal and generalize the physics of morphing lifting surfaces to optimize its performance while encountering transient wake-inflow conditions. An integrated experimental and analytical approach is proposed to study the non-linear fluid-structure interaction (FSI) of adaptive lifting surfaces in such unsteady flows. The central hypothesis is that shape morphing can dynamically balance the unsteady loads on such adaptive lifting surfaces by selectively tuning the hydro-elastic response in a transient wake-inflow. The specific objectives are: (a) Unravel the complex non-linear FSI response of adaptive underwater lifting surfaces in a range of unsteady flows; (b) Decipher the spatial and temporal features of the vorticity dynamics and surface pressure through the time-resolved realization of the 3D flow-field and surface pressure; (c) Discover the changes in the above non-linear FSI response when the dynamically deforming lifting surface is subjected to a spatially varying inflow caused by periodic vortical disturbances; (d) Develop analytical models by significantly advancing the existing potential-flow-based framework.

"Academic fraud and failed attempts to replicate research have amplified concerns about scientists’ ethical practices. Registered reports are a new method of publication where peer review and guarantee of publication occurs before data collection. This project tests if registered reports can increase ethical research practices related to transparency and decrease questionable research practices among early career researchers. Lack of job security leaves early career researchers vulnerable to questionable research practices, and early career researchers in departments with publish-or-perish cultural norms may be particularly susceptible. Registered reports are hypothesized to be most effective for this group, as they align the incentives to publish with the value of ethical practices. The project will conclude by designing and evaluating an online intervention meant to help early career researchers understand the benefits and barriers of registered reports. The project will also produce a free online tutorial on submitting registered reports and the ethical implications of doing so, and a series of cross-disciplinary online and in-person workshops that will encourage a culture of ethical research practices through registered reports in a variety of STEM fields. 

This project explores the impact of registered reports on early career researchers’ research ethics related to transparency and their likelihood of engaging in questionable research practices. The mixed-methods research design uses cross-sectional and longitudinal data to assess the effects of registered reports. The first study tracks authors to assess if registered reports affect ethical research attitudes, values, and behaviors. The second study uses survey research to assess if those who complete registered reports use more ethical research practices. The third study uses data from focus groups to uncover barriers to adopting registered reports among early career faculty. The fourth study uses an online intervention across a range of conditions to assess if the intervention influences early career researchers’ intentions to use registered reports and to identify cultural factors that could modify the efficacy of the intervention. Overall, this project advances scientific knowledge related to research ethics by exploring whether registered reports can act as a mechanism for encouraging ethical research practices among early career researchers.

"Advanced control systems, such as self-driving cars, autonomous robots, and bio-reactors, exhibit complex behaviors, which do not follow simple proportional rules and linear relationships. Control of those non-linear systems remains a challenge for engineers in many industrial sectors. This research aims to reduce a complex, nonlinear system to a linear system while retaining the original nonlinear behaviors. Once converted to a linear system, control design becomes easier and computational complexity significantly reduces. This advantageous result is made possible by representing the system with more variables than we usually use. While a traditional description using a limited number of variables leads to non-linearity, this new method using more variables allows one to deal with non-linearity in a linear domain. With this new method, challenging non-linear control problems can be made tractable, and simple, and practical solutions may be created for a broad class of control systems and products.

According to Koopman, an autonomous, nonlinear dynamical system can be represented as a linear system in an infinite dimensional space. The theory guarantees the exact linearization, but it is not applicable to systems with active control inputs, and the number of variables must be truncated to a finite dimensional system for practical use. Furthermore, the original theory does not state how to find additional variables, called observables, to represent a nonlinear system in the lifted space, where the system behaves linearly. Here, we will establish a systematic way of finding effective observables based on physical modeling theory, namely, Bond Graphs modeling. Given the physical connectivity of system elements, a special class of observables, called auxiliary variables, are defined. Two linear state equations, one for state variables and the other for auxiliary variables, represent the nonlinear dynamics in the lifted space. This is known as Dual-Faceted (DF) Linearization. These auxiliary variables possess clear physical meanings, and use of these auxiliary variables for linear feedback can better inform the controller and outperforms its counterpart. If the auxiliary variables, or part of them, are physically measurable, the linear model can be identified through a data-driven sub-space method. The DF Linearization is particularly useful for nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC), where the linear model in the lifted space provides an accurate approximation over a finite time horizon and reduces the original nonlinear MPC to a linear MPC. The optimization problem becomes convex and the computation time drastically reduces.

"Animals move with superb agility, achieving exceptional athletic feats of endurance, speed and rapid maneuvering through complex terrain. This requires precise coordination of muscle contraction, sensing and neural control in response to rapidly changing interactions with the physical environment. Modern science has revealed increasing detail about the molecular mechanisms, growth and function of discrete tissues and systems such as muscle, neurons and bone. Yet a pronounced gap exists in understanding how these systems work together to achieve agile whole-body movement. The Integrative Movement Sciences Institute (IMSI) will bring to together 26 faculty from 21 institutions, with collective expertise across the spectrum of movement sciences from molecular biophysics of muscle to human rehabilitation and human-machine interaction. IMSI will create a nationwide collaboration network and training pipeline from undergraduate to faculty levels, to transform our field by integrating understanding of muscle function and movement from molecules to behavior. IMSI will train the next generation of scientists in effective cross-disciplinary communication, team-based science, mathematical modeling, data analysis and open data sharing. Research activities will focus on development of integrated models of movement with a wide range of applications for human exercise sciences, rehabilitation, and mobility assistance, including the design and control of prostheses, exoskeletons, and biologically-inspired legged robots.

A pronounced gap exists between ‘top-down’ approaches that focus on whole-animal behavior but lack insight into underlying mechanisms and ‘bottom-up’ approaches that identify molecular and biophysical mechanisms but lack insight into their contributions to behavior. Muscle forms a critical link in integrating mechanics and control of movement across scales. This project will fund communication, training and collaborative research development activities over 12-months to establish the Integrative Movement Sciences Institute (IMSI) at the University of California Irvine (UCI), with 26 faculty from 21 academic institutions. IMSI ‘Design’ activities include a workshop in Spring 2021 and a 4-week long Summer Research Institute in Summer 2021. Workshop activities will encourage thinking across disciplines and developing effective team-based collaborative approaches to overcome the challenges that currently inhibit integration across fields and organizational scales. The workshop will consolidate IMSI research themes and develop proposals for IMSI Summer Research Institute activities. The Summer Research Institute will be a 4-week event for enrolled trainees (undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs working in near-peer mentoring teams), with visiting PIs joining for one week to collaboratively lead seminars and short lab courses on topics designed to build interdisciplinary partnerships and integrate across scales. IMSI will focus on development of computationally tractable and predictive modeling tools for integrative neuromechanics of movement. These tools have potential to transform numerous fields— enabling neuroscientists, biologists, clinicians and biomedical engineers to ask questions about integrative whole organism behavior, sensorimotor control, musculoskeletal function and neuromuscular plasticity.

"Approximately one quarter of carbon emissions each year is taken up by the worlds’ oceans, which play a critical role in the global carbon cycle. As the oceans continue to respond to climate change, it is important to understand the carbon cycle and how it will change as well. In the surface waters of the ocean, phytoplankton take up carbon through photosynthesis, and a small fraction of this material then sinks to the deeper ocean in a process referred to as the “biological pump.” Current estimates of the global biological pump are similar in size to the amount of global carbon emissions, but uncertainties in these estimates are very large. This project will focus on understanding the role that marine phytoplankton in the North Atlantic Ocean play in the carbon cycle. The project will employ coordinated use of state-of-the-art, remote observational tools, namely biogeochemical profiling floats and ocean color observations from satellites. New techniques will be developed to maximize the information that can be glean from these observations and constrain biological carbon fluxes out of the sunlit upper ocean and through its deeper interior layers over basin-wide, seasonal, and annual scales. Finally, the performance of existing, satellite-based models of these biological fluxes will be evaluated in comparison with analogous estimates made from biogeochemical profiling float data, which can help to fill in satellite observing gaps below the surface and during periods of heavy cloud cover. The proposed effort will provide training and mentorship to a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher. Outreach will be conducted through the 2021 Education And Research: Testing Hypotheses (EARTH) Workshop: A successful, ~15-year collaborative effort between MBARI and the Monterey Bay Aquarium to assist educators with incorporating ocean science information and real-time data into the classroom. To enhance diversity and inclusion in ocean science, a first-generation college student will be selected to participate in the 2021 MBARI Summer Intern Program. 

Persistent and spatially-distributed in situ observations are needed to develop, and continuously train, more accurate models and remote-sensing algorithms to reduce the uncertainty (currently >100%) in estimates of the biological pump magnitude. The goals of the proposed effort are to develop, implement, and compare robust methods for quantifying biological carbon sequestration by leveraging the complementary information provided by bio-optical and chemical sensors on profiling floats deployed in the North Atlantic Ocean. This project will dovetail with several larger observational programs (EXPORTS, PACE, and pending Global Biogeochemical Argo) and leverage committed NOAA and NASA funding to deploy four biogeochemical profiling floats. Results from the analysis of float data will also be compared with estimates derived from satellite observations to assess the influences of 1) subpolar spring bloom timing and magnitude; and 2) more efficient subtropical carbon export processes, on the amount of carbon annually sequestered by the biological pump. Evaluating carbon production, recycling, and export from different perspectives (e.g., chemical, optical, and remote sensing), will capitalize on the strengths of different sensors and platforms using a combination of standard and novel methods. Quality-control of the data from ~300 existing and four newly deployed profiling floats in the North Atlantic will result in a valuable resource for other investigators. Data handling and processing tools developed during this project will be made publicly available to reduce barriers to entry for other scientists and students interested in analyzing large volumes of BGC float and ocean color data.

In the surface waters of the ocean, phytoplankton take up carbon through photosynthesis, and a small fraction of this material then sinks to the deeper ocean in a process referred to as the “biological pump.” Current estimates of the global biological pump are similar in size to the amount of global carbon emissions, but uncertainties in these estimates are very large. This project will focus on understanding the role that marine phytoplankton in the North Atlantic Ocean play in the carbon cycle. The project will employ coordinated use of state-of-the-art, remote observational tools, namely biogeochemical profiling floats and ocean color observations from satellites. New techniques will be developed to maximize the information that can be glean from these observations and constrain biological carbon fluxes out of the sunlit upper ocean and through its deeper interior layers over basin-wide, seasonal, and annual scales. Finally, the performance of existing, satellite-based models of these biological fluxes will be evaluated in comparison with analogous estimates made from biogeochemical profiling float data, which can help to fill in satellite observing gaps below the surface and during periods of heavy cloud cover. The proposed effort will provide training and mentorship to a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher. Outreach will be conducted through the 2021 Education And Research: Testing Hypotheses (EARTH) Workshop: A successful, ~15-year collaborative effort between MBARI and the Monterey Bay Aquarium to assist educators with incorporating ocean science information and real-time data into the classroom. To enhance diversity and inclusion in ocean science, a first-generation college student will be selected to participate in the 2021 MBARI Summer Intern Program. 

Persistent and spatially-distributed in situ observations are needed to develop, and continuously train, more accurate models and remote-sensing algorithms to reduce the uncertainty (currently >100%) in estimates of the biological pump magnitude. The goals of the proposed effort are to develop, implement, and compare robust methods for quantifying biological carbon sequestration by leveraging the complementary information provided by bio-optical and chemical sensors on profiling floats deployed in the North Atlantic Ocean. This project will dovetail with several larger observational programs (EXPORTS, PACE, and pending Global Biogeochemical Argo) and leverage committed NOAA and NASA funding to deploy four biogeochemical profiling floats. Results from the analysis of float data will also be compared with estimates derived from satellite observations to assess the influences of 1) subpolar spring bloom timing and magnitude; and 2) more efficient subtropical carbon export processes, on the amount of carbon annually sequestered by the biological pump. Evaluating carbon production, recycling, and export from different perspectives (e.g., chemical, optical, and remote sensing), will capitalize on the strengths of different sensors and platforms using a combination of standard and novel methods. Quality-control of the data from ~300 existing and four newly deployed profiling floats in the North Atlantic will result in a valuable resource for other investigators. Data handling and processing tools developed during this project will be made publicly available to reduce barriers to entry for other scientists and students interested in analyzing large volumes of BGC float and ocean color data.

"Environmental factors exert considerable influence over processes of growth and development, and stress experienced in early life can have long-term consequences for health and mortality risk. It is therefore critical to understand when individuals are most vulnerable to stress exposures. Sensitive developmental windows (SDW) are periods in early life when energy needs are high, and developing tissues exhibit greater plasticity in response to stress. This doctoral dissertation project will examine evidence of plasticity in the human skeletal system using a SDW framework, in order to better understand how the timing of stress exposures in early life influence patterns of disease susceptibility and mortality risk over the lifespan. The intellectual impacts of this project will be the production of a novel framework in which to more clearly define the relationship between early life environments, biology, and health outcomes across the lifespan. Insights derived from this project about the lifetime impacts of developmental stress may inform research in human development and public health. The project will also facilitate training of undergraduate and graduate students in non-destructive methods of skeletal analysis that are broadly applicable across modern, historical, and archaeological contexts. 

This project will improve existing methods of identifying and interpreting evidence of plasticity in the skeletal system by examining a set of asymmetries in skeletal elements that capture an extended period of early child development. Evidence for plasticity will be measured through the SDW framework by calculating asymmetry indices in three skeletal samples that represent human populations engaged in different modes of subsistence, social organization, and diet (early farmers, prehistoric agriculturalists, and historic preindustrialists). These asymmetry indices will be compared across populations and assessed using childhood mortality rates, age-at-death and adult stature as covariates, so that the impact of plasticity on mortality risk over the lifespan can be evaluated. The methodology employed in this project involves non-destructive analysis of skeletal elements, providing an accessible approach to examining plasticity.

"Humans, and the animals and plants around them, live in a microbial world. It is now well-known that microbes and viruses infect, interact and move through the genomes of every organism on Earth. Relationships among organisms, and with their microbes, can dramatically change the traits, behaviors, and functions of the host plant or animal. Sometimes these interactions are beneficial and sometimes they can be detrimental by causing disease. Many influence host function and can have hidden but important global scale impacts, driving the rates of responses to climate change, health and disease, antibiotic resistance, and more. Understanding how nested interactions within the microbial world occur and influence our ecosystems is critical to controlling their impact. The new Biology Integration Institute, Genomics and Eco-evolution of Multi-Scale Symbiosis (GEMS), focuses on the classical species interaction between clover and honeybee pollinators as a model to understand the impact and dynamics of the myriad of microbes nested within them. The project takes an integrative approach to understand how molecular interactions impact the ecosystem. As a $20 billion US industry, the outcomes of the project studying clover/honeybee nested genomes has practical value as well as being a model for addressing fundamental questions in integrative biology. The researchers in GEMS are collaborative, diverse, interactive scientists and educators who take an inter-disciplinary approach to answer critical questions about how nested genomes interact and affect the world. The project uses a shared leadership model with co-mentorship between trainer and trainee and multisite educational activities. The established institute is designed to integrate biological disciplines to understand how nested genomes respond to environmental change.

GEMS will address the fundamental biological question, How do symbioses unify biology, from molecule to ecosystem?  The goal of this project is to establish a framework for how the phenotypic variation generated by the mobility of nested symbionts influences the adaptability of traits and the strength and stability of species interactions. Ultimately, the Institute aims to understand how this variation impacts ecosystem responses to environmental change. The Institute is grounded in the canonical symbiosis between flowering plants and insect pollinators (clover and honeybees), expanding to include interactions nested in their microbial world. The research leverages the extensive knowledge in multiple nested interactions (plant–pollinator, legume–rhizobium, honey bee–microbiome) to build connections within and across systems from the molecular processes that govern establishment of symbiosis and extend phenotypic traits to define how they interact and evolve together in the natural world. Data are integrated with ecological and evolutionary theory to generalize beyond the focal systems to build predictive models. Computer science, statistics, and mathematics expand both the range of biological questions asked and the impact of their answers. Along with the traditional academic silos dividing researchers into molecular and organismal units that prevent a unified view of biology are many others, such as those separating microbe from macrobe, plant from animal, student from faculty, education from research, and diversity, equity, and inclusion from science.  Through K-12 education in Spanish and targeting excellence with Project Microbe and the Jim Holland program in three urban and rural communities in the Midwest, GEMS focuses on the intersecting goals of changing how biology is done and who does it, unifying biology by including the small but powerful so often overlooked.

"In nonhuman primates a range of male behaviors are observed that relate to male success in siring offspring. This doctoral dissertation research project examines reproductive payoffs of different male strategies (aggressive versus affiliative) in wild geladas (primates). Results from this study provide valuable insights about the evolution of male reproductive strategies and will enhance understanding about the adaptive significance of male-female social bonds in a long-lived primate species. While conducting the proposed research, the doctoral student will continue to work with K-12 students from underrepresented communities to foster excitement about science and research and give talks about primate behavior and evolution at local elementary schools. Additionally, the doctoral student will continue training undergraduate students in the laboratory throughout her dissertation research and mentor women from groups underrepresented in primatology.

This research investigates how different male behavioral strategies affect reproductive success in geladas. Male geladas gain reproductive opportunities by becoming the dominant leader over a family of multiple females and their offspring. Male reproduction is thus a function of the number of fertile females in the group combined with how long he remains the dominant leader (tenure length). The proposed project will use long term data (collected over 13 years) in combination with detailed behavioral, hormonal, and paternity data from individually known leader males to assess which factors contribute to male reproductive success. First, the investigators will measure reproductive success by assigning paternity through genotyping all leader males and infants in the project. Second, they will quantify physical attributes that could affect reproductive success in geladas. These include: i) body size (measured through laser photogrammetry), ii) chest patch redness (measured by comparing photos of gelada chest patch against a standard color checker chart), and iii) testosterone levels using fecal samples collected from individual leader males (measured through a biotin labelled enzyme-immunoassay). Third, the investigators will assess what social strategies males employ to increase reproductive success by quantifying male-female social relationships through behavioral observations and recording the occurrence of infanticide.

"Interactions between microbes and plants or microbes and animals are common. In many cases, both parties benefit from these interactions to the extent that they are dependent on one another and over time their interaction becomes irreversible. This project will bring together researchers working with a range of investigatory tools (such as measuring nutrient exchange, signaling and chemical communication, genomic approach, and mathematical modeling) in a range of systems (including plants and mycorrizal fungi, fungus growing ants, cockroaches with endosymbiontic gut microbes, carnivorous pitcher plants) so that they can lay the groundwork for developing a model that predicts the point of no return: that point at which the individual species in the system lose the ability to function independent of their partner. By seeking connections across the diversity of these systems, we hope to better understand the factors that lead to the development of partner dependence.  A major outcome of the project will be the development of training programs at three levels. Outreach and training will be developed for students at Metro High School in Columbus. This diverse urban school serves as a magnet for talented high school students with an interested in STEM fields. Training activities will include summer research projects in affiliated labs. A training program for undergraduate and graduate students at Ohio State University, and hold two workshops, one for faculty and students at regional universities in Ohio and one for people from HBCUs and HSIs. 

This project will develop a Biology Integration Institute application that seeks to determine the factors that push microbial symbioses past the point of no return to partner dependence. Partner dependence, which occurs when a symbiont requires an association with a partner for successful reproduction, represents a major evolutionary transition. Symbioses are complex adaptive systems, in which patterns emerge from the interactions and responses among partners and interactions between the partnership and other organisms. The development of symbioses relies on communication below the level of the organism and is often driven by molecules and cellular responses within the partners, but the advantages of the association may relate to community and ecosystem interactions, and the processes by which the partners adapt and respond are governed by evolutionary forces. Understanding and predicting the patterns of dependence and other phenomena within and across taxa requires understanding the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of these systems. While this Design proposal is focused on process instead of products, we expect to produce synthetic papers that will make connections across scales and lay the groundwork for future theory development and work in empirical systems.

"Pheromones are a prevalent volatile communication signal in nature, but their range and noise tolerance of information exchange are limited by the spatiotemporal decay of these signals. Using honeybees as a model organism, the researchers will study the communication network of honeybee swarms that locate their queen by tracking her pheromones. Specifically, how can honeybees that are far away from the queen locate her? Bees disperse information about the queen's location via a pheromone gland located on their abdomen. Importantly, bees not only passively diffuse these pheromones but also actively fan their wings, which draws air along their anteroposterior axis. The researchers will study the localized airflow, which the PI hypothesized that it creates a directional bias in the diffusion of the pheromones to ensure the signal reaches the rest of the swarm. As bees arrange in a specific spatial distribution where there is a characteristic distance between individuals and a characteristic direction in which individuals broadcast the signal, the researchers will study (1) how this dynamic network recruits new broadcasting bees over time as the pheromones traveled a distance which is orders of magnitude the size of an individual; and (2) how the swarm overcomes local obstacles such as solid objects as well as turbulent airflow and opposing chemical signals. Our world is full of living creatures who routinely exchange information with each other in order to survive and reproduce. Understanding these communication signals is not just a problem in biology, but also one in physics - given the energetic cost, compression, and detectability of the exchanged information. Since the energetic cost of signal production drives bees to push the envelope in terms of minimal signal design and maximal signal to noise ratios, these fascinating communication strategies could reveal new optimalities in signal design and signal processing. Harnessing these natural solutions - honed by eons of evolution, selection, and refinement - we can not only more deeply understand collective animal behavior, but also leverage that understanding to create bio-inspired system designs in the fields of swarm robotics and distributed communication, not to mention in agriculture.

Honeybee swarms hold an impressive skill-set when it comes to manipulating large length-scale physical fields such as mechanical strains and flow-mediated temperatures. But to become a coherent swarm in the first place, honeybees must locate their queen by tracking her pheromones that decay rapidly in time and space. Unlike the traditional isotropic chemical signaling (as seen in early embryonic development and aggregation of amoebae), bees use a new artifice to direct their communication signal - airflow. In this complex system, the individual building blocks (an insect) can sense their micro-environment and respond in a way that promotes survival; typically, the response changes the macro-environment the individual is embedded in, thus creating a perpetual coupling between the individuals, the group and the environment. When combined with quantitative analysis and computations, the researchers will integrate the sensing of the environmental cues (pheromone concentration and airflow) and convert them to behavioral outputs that allow the swarm to remain coherent. Hence, this work expands the traditional view of collective behavior via stigmergy (wherein organisms respond to local cues with little or no long-range effects) to establish long-range interactions mediated by physics.

"Synthetic biology (SynBio) is a revolutionary combination of engineering and life sciences. It empowers investigators to design and build from the ground up useful new biological systems such as metabolic pathways. SynBio can also uncover the deep operating principles that underlie biological systems – the ‘Rules of Life’. This is done by applying the build-to-learn philosophy, i.e. (i) design and construct biosystems based on current knowledge of the Rules; (ii) if the systems don’t perform as predicted, diagnose why and thus deepen knowledge of the Rules. Despite its intellectual power and practical potential in metabolic engineering, SynBio has been slow to reach plant biology and SynBio training has historically been concentrated in engineering schools where women and other groups are notably underrepresented. There is consequently an urgent need to bring SynBio into mainstream plant metabolism research and diversified training, and to use SynBio’s build-to-learn philosophy to define Rules for redesigning plant metabolism. This project will accordingly harness the complementary SynBio strengths of three leading plant science universities to design a tri-campus PhD training and research program to define Rules to guide engineering of novel metabolic pathways. The project will be designed in virtual workshops, one hosted by each campus. Design goals will be to (i) integrate basic engineering skills and internships in SynBio companies into PhD training, leading to an interuniversity graduate research certificate, and (ii) develop strategies to recruit women to redress the gender imbalance in engineering. The workshops will also help plan a major 2021 Plant SynBio Conference, which Co-PI Lenaghan will chair.           


Synthetic biology (SynBio) has the power to change biology from a descriptive to a prescriptive discipline and to transform plant improvement, particularly of metabolic traits. However, perhaps because its roots are in chemical engineering, the SynBio revolution has barely reached plant science yet. To address the critical shortage of SynBio PhD training for plant scientists, and the underrepresentation of women in the field, plant scientists and metabolic engineers at three major plant science universities (University of Florida, University of Tennessee, and Purdue University) have come together in this project to pool their complementary expertise to design a coordinated three-campus PhD training and research program in SynBio. The project will hold three virtual workshops (one hosted by each university) to plan a graduate certificate in SynBio and a concerted research plan to define Rules of Life that (i) predict how well enzymes and metabolic pathways developed in microbial SynBio platforms will transfer to plants, and (ii) enable the amount, stoichiometry, and timing of enzyme activity to be adjusted to assure efficient operation of new multienzyme pathways in plants. In the certificate program, online flipped-classroom courses will be given in their areas of expertise by each university and SynBio companies will be recruited to host internships for students. Courses will cover basic coding, engineering principles, metabolic engineering, synthetic regulatory circuits, and directed evolution. The workshops will also plan strategies to recruit women. Lastly, the workshops will help plan the American Society of Plant Biologists’ 2021 SynBio Conference, which Co-PI Lenaghan will chair.

"The concept of resilience - the ability of any system to return to a previous state after a perturbation – provides an ideal opportunity to unite different scales of biological research.  The ever-increasing specialization of scientific research has made it challenging for researchers in different fields of biology to exchange ideas. The study of system resilience, however, is common to all biological fields of study.  The overarching objective of this project is to use the theme of resilience to bridge cellular, organismal, and community-level scales of biology by synthesizing the tools, concepts, and approaches used by the different research fields. They will be integrated through 1) collaborative research that includes undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, and faculty, 2) curricular enrichment, and 3) outreach to other institutions, non-profits, and industry. Conserved mechanisms of resilience identified through these activities will be applicable to engineer and manage biological systems in medical, agricultural, industrial, and natural contexts.

This project will challenge scientists to span disciplinary, taxonomic, methodological, and other divides in biology to build and apply a unified framework for biological resilience. Many fields of biology have described resilience in their systems of study, but rarely are there integrative efforts to search for common patterns and processes of resilience across temporal and spatial scales. The first step of the project is to examine how existing models and metrics of resilience are implemented across biological scales. The second step is to determine if there are common mechanisms across scales that allow biological systems to maintain resilience. The final step will be to identify how the basic science of biological resilience can be used to design and manage cellular, organismal, and ecological systems. These areas of resilience will be examined through interdepartmental seminars in biological resilience, a regional symposium on biological resilience, a new graduate module on biological resilience, and graduate research fellowships in biological resilience.  The investigators will carefully examine and refine the existing lexicon for biological resilience that can be widely adopted by other biologists and integrative biology research institutions.

"The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis changed the trajectory of life on Earth. By about 2.4 billion years ago, photosynthesis began to cause accumulation of oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere. This oxygen eventually allowed multicellular animals to evolve. However, scientists do not know when or how oxygenic photosynthesis evolved. Understanding its origin requires integrating data and ideas from biochemistry, microbiology, evolutionary biology, and Earth history. This project will bring together individual scientists with the breadth of knowledge and diversity of skills to identify and address the key questions for understanding oxygenic photosynthesis. Specifically, researchers will design a cross-disciplinary Biology Integration Institute on The Evolution of Oxygenic Photosynthesis. The team will include university students and early career scientists who will learn cross-disciplinary techniques through participation in project-related activities and as part of a graduate level course that integrates appropriate sciences. Public outreach and education projects will show others how scientists work together on complicated problems. The researchers are committed to diversity, inclusivity, and academic excellence, and they will apply best practices for broadening participation and integrating educational components into the project.
 
The researchers will establish a cross-disciplinary collaboration at UC Davis to investigate the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. Through a series of workshops, they will: 1) assess current knowledge and hypotheses; 2) articulate outstanding questions that transcend subdisciplines and can be productively addressed by an interdisciplinary team; 3) identify additional key collaborators to address research questions; 4) build an interdisciplinary and interinstitutional research team to answer the target questions; and 5) host a writing workshop for all collaborators to construct an Implementation proposal with active participation from the full Implementation team. This project advances the mission of the Biology Integration Institute and NSF by linking researchers across biological and geological disciplines.

"The goal of this project is triggering cell-type-specific behaviors with rationally designed nano-environments. Cell behavior critically depends on the cellular microenvironment, i.e. the physical and (bio)chemical properties of the material surrounding the cell. The PIs have demonstrated that nanostructures in the environment elicit a unique and universal response across cell types. The response to subcellular scale nano-environment can drive unique cell behaviors, including guidance over large distances, control with subcellular precision, and, when combined with other cell guidance cues, cell behavior that is controlled on multiple scales. The research will yield quantitative insights and predictive phase-field simulations that will be validated and improved in feedback between experiments and simulations. This feedback loop relies critically on controlled cellular experiments with advanced image analysis, cutting-edge 3D phase-field modeling, and machine learning to link experiments and simulations and forge a path towards predictive understanding of cell behavior in nano-environments. Precise control of cell behavior with nano-environments holds great promise for a broad range of biological and biomedical applications that require precise steering of the migration and behavior of cells and tissues. The research project will allow the PIs to develop guiding principles for the design of such nano-environments for specific tasks, which will enable these materials to be applied to a broad range of tasks that are beneficial to society through medical and other technologies. The PIs will train scientists in the use of the image-analysis and modeling software that will be developed, which will be freely available. This training will be offered in the form of week-long, intensive bootcamps. The PIs will also use the research to reach out to the general public. The results of the project will be broadly disseminated to the academic community through publications, conferences and workshops.

Esotaxis, the guidance of cytoskeletal dynamics by nanotopography, is a phenomenon that was discovered only recently by the PIs. It is a highly conserved phenomenon in mammalian cells that opens up novel, cell-type-specific and spatially precise control opportunities, but it is not yet well understood. This project will lead to a predictive understanding of esotaxis and how it can be harnessed with rationally designed nano-environments. This understanding will be achieved through an iterative cycle involving materials design and fabrication, validation through cellular imaging and advanced analysis, and tuning and extension of the three dimensional phase field simulations. Machine learning approaches will allow the team to determine which cellular characteristics are the most important for determining esotactic phenotypes, as well as well as to correlate nano-topographic features with specific esotactic behaviors. Starting with initial results from 3D phase-field simulations that exhibit qualitative agreement with key experimental predictions, the team expects to develop a quantitatively predictive model that, as a second goal, will also incorporate realistic cytoskeletal dynamics, and enable simultaneous control of cell functions on multiple scales. The third goal is to demonstrate cell type specific control in a biologically relevant model.

"The human pattern of growth, development, reproduction and aging is unusual compared to that of our closest living primate relatives and distinctive among primates as a whole. Humans have exceptionally long lifespans, closely spaced births, an extended period of juvenile dependence and support in raising offspring by post-reproductive females. These unique life history traits have been linked to social (shared infant care) and cognitive (e.g. innovativeness) traits observed in modern humans. This doctoral dissertation research project will use state-of-the-art microscopy and chemical methods to advance current knowledge about how modern human life history evolved, by analyzing biological ‘histories’ in the fossilized remains of our extinct relatives. The study findings may inform clinical research on hard tissue diseases associated with age, reproduction and/or metabolic conditions. This project will involve the training of minority undergraduate students at NYU in the processes of lab work and data collection. The outcomes of this research will be presented to a wider audience through museum outreach activities and international collaborations.

This project will use cutting-edge technologies to investigate changes in bone and teeth related to reproductive physiology. Bones and teeth record physiologically impactful events affecting the organism in the form of altered growth-layers. The investigator will generate histological thin sections to examine these growth layers using both optical and electron microscopy. In addition, complete elemental analysis of the growth layers will be carried out and a library of “elemental fingerprints” of the various types of events (pregnancy, menopause, sexual maturity, as well as illnesses and other physiological stressors) will be constructed. Finally, since the fossil remains of our extinct relatives cannot be physically sectioned for preservation reasons, the project will utilize extremely high-energy and high-resolution microtomography (phase-contrast synchrotron radiation computed micro-tomography) to gain access to the internal structure of teeth in a non-destructive way.  The methods developed in this project will lay the groundwork for future application to the hominin fossil record.

"The need for secured computer and internet storage has seen a rapid increase over time. To address this challenge, this project will develop a DNA nanotechnology-based cryptographic protocol for writing and reading digital data. It will be developed to enable both high-capacity and highly-secured information storage and high-speed information retrieval. DNA nanotechnology will be utilized to encrypt information in molecular patterns formed upon DNA folding, which is uniquely determined by a set of DNA information strands and a special folding route of DNA strands that function as the encryption keys. The programmability of DNA nanostructures creates a vast design space for the encryption keys, making it practically impossible to intercept and break the encryption. The molecular patterns on DNA nanostructures will be characterized by a super-resolution imaging method and a low-noise nanopore device. These methods can enable fast readout speed at 1 megahertz with a high spatial resolution of smaller than 10 nanometers. If successful, this DNA-based storage has a potential to be implemented on a portable platform, thus strongly supporting the development of next-generation DNA-based memories with significantly improved security and storage density at a low cost. Consequently, the secured DNA-based storage will benefit the U.S. economy and society. This research involves several disciplines including nanofabrication, materials science, biochemistry, electronics, photonics, and data science. The project will engage underrepresented groups in the research and positively impact STEM education.

DNA has emerged as a promising candidate to store information that can rival semiconductor memory, due to its high stability, high information density, and accompanying readout technologies. However, the potential of DNA as a material for highly-secured information storage has not been fully exploited. Additionally, the readout of conventional DNA-based memories has been limited by DNA sequencing, which requires special instruments and personnel training. This research is to fill the knowledge gap by creating a significantly improved and high-security DNA-based molecular cryptography and establishing a high-speed, high-resolution, and potentially portable readout platform for DNA memory. The research team will embed encrypted information in three-dimensional DNA origami nanostructures in the form of nanoscopic patterns. A pool of DNA scaffold strands decorated with specific information strands (i-strands) of different sequences, lengths, and binding positions will be designed on the basis of a chosen DNA folding scheme out of many possibilities, which will be used later in decryption of the pattern of i-strands. The high spatial resolution of DNA-PAINT (DNA-based point accumulation for imaging in nanoscopic topography) (<20 nm) and sapphire-supported nanopore sensors (<10 nm) will support high-density information decryption of intricate single-molecule patterns on the DNA origami, while enabling a fast readout speed of up to 1 MHz. The fast readout methods will employ deep-learning classification techniques for automated decryption and improved accuracy. The encryption scheme, single-molecule characterization methods, nanopore sensor designs, and data analysis algorithms will be synergistically improved in this project to enable robust and effective information storage and transmission.

"The oceans play a critical role in the global carbon cycle, currently absorbing approximately one-quarter of the carbon dioxide emissions each year. This carbon is moved from the surface waters to the deep ocean by physical and biological processes. The first is by physical movement, or subduction, of water from the surface to the deep ocean. This is referred to as the solubility pump. The second mechanism, called the biological pump, starts with phytoplankton that take up carbon through photosynthesis in the surface ocean. A small fraction of this material then sinks to the deeper ocean. In a third mechanism, swimming organisms can actively transport material from surface to deeper waters. A current challenge is to understand how all three of these processes interact in smaller patches of the oceans, and to incorporate this knowledge into ocean and climate models. This project will examine these processes using a high-resolution ocean model and comparisons to real-world observations. The project will support early career female scientists, a graduate student, and undergraduate interns. The project will also contribute to the summer Questioning Underlies Effective Science Teaching (QUEST) hands-on program for elementary and middle school teachers, and to a course taught at Princeton University by the lead investigator that uses models developed in her research to teach students how to think critically about ocean and climate models. 


Observations show that the ocean carbon pump is modulated by eddies, fronts and filaments, but the integrated effect of these ubiquitous ocean features on the global carbon export is poorly constrained. The proposed effort will harness a high-resolution bio-physical model and existing observations to advance the mechanistic understanding of the biological and physical pumps occurring at small-scale. This project will add to previous works that studied small-scale subduction (from the PI and other groups) and examine how eddy-driven ecosystem patchiness and trophic interactions influence the subduction and sinking pumps (Objective 1). The project will also bring new mechanistic insights in the migration pump (Objective 2). Specifically, how eddy effects modulate the interplay between mesozooplankton abundance, grazing and diurnal migration amplitude. This project excludes the effects of migrations on seasonal scales, larger mesopelagic animals, and some biological factors (e.g. body-size). Yet it will provide a much-needed baseline for future work to explore this pump in more realistic cases, such as the interpretation of high resolution in-situ measurements and the analysis of global model results. This project will also provide, for the first time, a synthesis of the ocean carbon pumps response to small-scale dynamics in a regional framework over a full seasonal cycle (Objective 3). This project will use an idealized double gyre model but the contrasted regions will give a broad perspective, relevant to the understanding of the global ocean carbon pump and how it might respond to climate change.

"This award is made to Montana State University to acquire a uniquely configured Multi-Modality Multi-Photon Digital Fluorescence Microscope. The Center for Biofilm Engineering at Montana State University, where the requested instrument will be located, was originally established in 1990 as an NSF Engineering Research Center (ERC), and it has a central mission to advance the frontiers of health, energy, industry, and the environment through biofilm research, education, and outreach. From inception, the Center for Biofilm Engineering has taken a transdisciplinary approach to fundamental and applied research that continues today and that embodies the Montana State University land-grant mission for the integration of learning and discovery. Such research empowers students to apply fundamental knowledge to real-world challenges. Currently, one of the biggest challenges for engineering-based biological applications is the ability to noninvasively visualize highly replicated live bio-systems in real-time.

To overcome challenges with conducting physiologically relevant research in natural and engineered systems, the Multi-Photon Digital Fluorescence Microscope will enable unprecedented image acquisition speeds, significantly reduce phototoxicity, provide high resolution label free identification of single cells, and increase penetration depths producing images more representative of intact biofilms. All of these advancements are integral to maintaining cell viability during imaging and will support research projects of faculty, staff, and students across three colleges (Engineering, Science, and Agriculture). The acquisition of this instrument will allow cutting-edge, real-time, high-sensitivity imaging of intact, complex biological samples and is, thus, ideally suited for biofilm systems.

This project is jointly funded by CBET-MRI Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Program.

"This IRES project involves a collaboration between Montclair State University (MSU) and three partners in Japan: the National Institute of Genetics (NIG); the Institute of Transformative Bio-Molecules (ITbM) at Nagoya University; and the National Institute of Basic Biology (NIBB). The overarching goal of the project is to provide a rich international research experience for STEM students with the expectation that it will serve as a foundation for them to engage in the global scientific community. The mentors at these three institutes are world-renowned for their expertise on genetic and behavioral studies using medaka and have state-of-the-art facilities to support this research. The specific aims are to have students utilize cutting-edge gene editing techniques as they learn about the role of genes in behavioral sciences, improve their communication, teamwork, and cross-cultural skills, and contribute to a publication in a scientific peer-reviewed journal.  The project will engage a total of 18 U.S. graduate and upper-class undergraduate students over three years.  Students will be recruited nationally, with special consideration for the inclusion of students who typically do not have access to such research experiences. Each cohort of six students will participate in pre-program workshops on research techniques, cultural and language lessons, and professional development for two weeks before their eight-week research experience. Through its active recruitment of underrepresented students, the project will provide rich opportunities for students who typically overlook such experiences while at the same time contributing to the diversification of the scientific community at the global level.
 
Each Japanese Institute will host a pair of U.S. students, who will work within existing teams to study seasonal, physiological, and behavioral processes using Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) as a model organism. The scientific objective of their work will be to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in behavioral adaptations of animals to environmental changes. Each team will be using state-of-the-art CRISPR-Cas9 DNA editing techniques. The students at ITbM and NIBB will be working to characterize and elucidate the function of selected genetic elements and their contributions to behavioral and seasonal changes. These genetic elements, that have been identified through a global screening, have been found to be differentially expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland of medaka fish during long- and short-day conditions. The research focus of the two students at NIG will be to generate and characterize mutant fish either lacking the expression of a gene termed cAMP Responsive Element Modulator (CREM) or lacking the expression of a unique isoform of the CREM gene termed Inducible cAMP Early Repressor (ICER). CREM belongs to a family of CRE-binding genes that code for activators and repressors of transcription. Most activators and repressors of the CREM gene have similar and redundant functions with other genes like CREB and ATF.  ICER, however, is unique among the products of other CRE-binding genes because it is an inducible and dominant transcriptional repressor. CREM has been found to be involved in many physiological processes but the precise contribution of ICER has not been elucidated. After the initial year, the two students working at NIG will be joining the efforts on studying other genes or genetic elements of the group of possible targets identified by the ITbM and NIBB researchers. This three-year research project has the potential to inform new practices in industries that are sensitive to environmental changes such as farming, agriculture, and aquaculture. More generally, the research will add to the body of literature on the interactions between genes and behavior.

"This project will design a new institute to investigate why males and females of some species differ in how long they live.  In humans, like in many other animals, females tend to live longer than males.  However, this lifespan difference between males and females is not universal. In some species females live longer, and in other species there is no lifespan difference between males and females. Why there are differences in aging and lifespan between males and females is currently unknown.  This project will address this question by bringing together experts from diverse fields of biology to form the Integration Institute: Sex, Aging, Genomics, and Epigenetics (IISAGE).  IISAGE will develop a coordinated research plan to investigate the contribution of genome instability to differences in lifespan between males and females across species. IISAGE will also establish an interdisciplinary training program for participating students. The project will conduct outreach to the scientific community through conferences and a website, and will specifically recruit underrepresented groups to participate in the institute.

Genome instability increases with age in many species and is considered an important contributor to aging.  However, there is a significant gap in knowledge concerning how genome instability variably impacts males versus females in aging and lifespan, and whether this differs across species with diverse life histories and mechanisms of sex determination.  IISAGE will build a community of scientists with various expertise in molecular biology, physiology, ecology, and evolutionary biology to comprehensively address how genome instability impacts sex differences in lifespan across the animal kingdom.  Specifically, the goals of IISAGE in the BII-Design phase are to: 1) Refine the specific questions addressed and methods employed by future IISAGE research; 2) Develop an interdisciplinary training/career development program for the members of IISAGE; and 3) Establish the procedures necessary for efficient data management and information exchange between the members of IISAGE.

"Understanding how biological systems interact with and influence one another over time is a Grand Challenge of Biology. Resolving this challenge is essential to predicting ecosystem responses to changing conditions to inform human action and policy. Yet understanding has been hampered because the Biological research community spans many sub-fields, each with its own perspectives, approaches, and focus, and with little exposure to one another. The EMergent Ecosystem Responses to ChanGE Biology Integration Institute (EMERGE BII) will integrate insights across Biochemistry, Genetics, Molecular Biology, Physiology, Ecology, Evolution, and Ecosystem Science to develop a comprehensive framework for these dynamic interactions. Leveraging the power of 14 organizations and 15 scientific subdisciplines, EMERGE integrates research and training, field observations and laboratory experiments, and novel measurements at unprecedented resolution, to understand a climate-critical case study: how a rapidly warming Arctic is transforming permafrost into wetlands, accelerating cycling of carbon, and further affecting earth's climate. EMERGE will train a new generation of integrative biologists through a program of research exchanges, a Summer Institute and an undergraduate research program. To further extend its impact, EMERGE will communicate its work to the public and the scientific community through such activities as a TEDx-style event and development of high school Integrative Biology Workshops. Collectively, the EMERGE BII’s discoveries, tools, and cutting-edge trainees will help society to respond to, and manage, changing biological systems.

The EMERGE BII leverages a decade of integrated system characterization of a thawing permafrost peatland to produce a framework for evaluating multi-level responses to changes in natural and engineered ecosystems. This framework integrates and expands upon genes-to-ecosystems understanding via new measurements to increase phylogenetic breadth and resolution of microbes (strain-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics), viruses (dsDNA, ssDNA, RNA), and mobile elements (plasmids, introns, and diversity generating retro-elements), to study interactions among them and with the ecosystem. The study then completes the loop to assess how changing ecosystems in turn impact communities, populations, and genes, via processes of acclimation, assembly and adaptation. A decade of field observations of microbial populations and communities at different thaw stages will be complemented by newly-enabled strain-resolved analyses of adaptation signatures, while perturbation experiments will characterize how microbes in complex communities acclimate to change. These genes-to-ecosystems-to-genes measurements, many of which will be firsts for natural communities, will be coupled to extensive biogeochemical and ecosystem measurements to assess their influence on system outputs, and to develop predictive models of community- (BioCrunch) and landscape- (ecosys) scale processes. This project will improve understanding of how thawing permafrost systems respond to and cause changes, with a focus on carbon cycling. The resultant framework will provide a foundation for assessing microbial change in other systems, like the National Science Foundation’s Long-term Ecological Research sites and National Ecological Observatory Network, where such highly resolved systems-level data are increasingly being collected.

"When two immiscible liquids are subject to an oscillating mechanical field that is applied perpendicular to their interface an instability may arise. This instability is manifested by the sudden generation of waves and fluid motion at the interface and is termed the Faraday instability. The effect of gravity on vibration-induced instability at the interface between liquid bilayers will be investigated. Experiments performed on the International Space Station will test theories about the onset of the Faraday instability and its associated flow patterns. This study will be the first attempt to utilize the unique environment of microgravity to obtain information on the Faraday instability problem.  Addressing this question could impact important processes here on Earth, including microfluidic mixing in bio-separations, microscale heat transfer, additive manufacturing, atomization-fuel injection, and patterned substrate development. The project involves graduate and undergraduate students working with space-implementation partner engineers. The project also involves both high school and middle school students from rural schools through summer science programs, in-class demonstrations, hands-on experiments, and live displays of microgravity experiments.

The Faraday instability arises from resonance between the applied frequency of shaking and the natural frequency of a liquid system with an interface. The morphological patterns of the interface are dominated by gravity and insensitive to interfacial tension. It is hypothesized that, when gravity is absent, the length scales of the instability are much smaller than under Earth’s gravity bringing out the dominant effect of interfacial tension. This, in turn, ought to cause the interface to rupture in the absence of gravity for small frequencies, but not for high frequencies. This research project seeks to validate models for Faraday instability with defining experiments conducted in the absence of gravity on the International Space Station, comparing these to ground experiments. The project also seeks to determine when the interface saturates to standing waves and when it breaks catastrophically to rupture. Experiments involve direct imaging under frequency and amplitude control while the theory involves Floquet and nonlinear analyses that employ high fidelity spectral methods. Validation of models by irrefutable evidence gathered under a well-controlled, unique microgravity environment have the potential to be translatable to other important fields such as acoustic, electrostatic, and magnetic levitation and forcing of fluid interfaces.

"While mammals evolved some of the largest brains in the animal kingdom, fruit flies, despite their miniature brains, exhibit remarkably sophisticated capabilities. They can navigate and fly in most wind conditions, and maneuver directly towards or evasively away from stimuli while remembering their location, as well as rest or walk in any angular orientation even in the dark. The smaller brain of the navigationally agile fruit fly thus presents a good road map for studying the fundamental principles of spatio-temporal navigation. Recent studies have shown that a brain area called the central complex (CX) gives rise to the internal compass and spatial memory of the fruit fly. The CX also exhibits ``hardware'' simplicity, efficiency and robust operation matched by scalable integration of sensory information. The CX circuit architecture is a prime candidate for building biologically informed intelligent machines for spatial navigation. The overriding goal of this project is to create silicon hardware that can incorporate the essence of the spatial-navigation circuits of the CX into neuromorphic hardware. By interweaving the two research directions of computational neuroscience and computer engineering, the project has a strong potential to develop an intelligent machine prototype for spatial navigation meeting the most demanding requirements of autonomous vehicles.

The goals of this project are three-fold: (1) distill the foundations underlying the navigation circuits in the CX, (2) expand upon its principles of computation and (3) provide an implementation of the resulting functionality in silicon. Achieving these goals calls for (i) developing a comprehensive, biologically informed circuit architecture for vision-based spatial navigation, (ii) investigating the circuit mechanisms that encode and store spatio-temporal information, and (iii) studying the roles that different types of visual information flows play in shaping the decision making circuits of the CX. Informed by this bio-architecture, the investigators will develop a silicon CX prototype that will substantially enhance programmability, size, power, and accuracy over conventional neuromorphic architectures.

"With the unprecedented success of deep learning in pattern recognition tasks, the demands for computational expenses required to train and implement such Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have also grown beyond current capabilities. “Neuromorphic Computing” strives to reduce the gap in computational efficiency of AI platforms by exploring bio-plausibility in the underlying computational primitives and hardware substrate. This project goes beyond   the focus of current neuromorphic computing architectures on computational models for neuron and synapse to examine other computational units of the biological brain that might contribute to cognition and especially self-repair.  To this end, this EAGER project will forge new directions by drawing inspiration and insights from computational neuroscience regarding functionalities of glial cells and explores their role in the fault-tolerant capacity of emerging hardware enabled neuromorphic computing platforms. Graduate students and undergraduates from Penn State's Schreyer Honors College will be involved in the project. The highly interdisciplinary nature of the project will contribute significantly to the training of next generation students who will gain knowledge in the design of neuromorphic computing frameworks combining knowledge from hardware, neuroscience and machine learning. The PI plans to integrate the results from this project into the Electrical Engineering departmental K-12 summer camp.

Prior literature on exploring impact of astrocytes on self-repair has been primarily confined to small scale networks without any machine learning perspective. Further, self-repair has been studied primarily from a simplistic software simulation standpoint with stuck-at-zero faults. Neuromorphic hardware implementations for astrocyte functionalities have been also limited to Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology – which is highly energy and area inefficient due to the functional mismatch between CMOS transistors and glial functionality. To bridge this gap, the proposed research agenda explores a hardware-software co-design approach to incorporate glial cell functionality in neuromorphic platforms through the usage of spintronic technologies. The EAGER program focuses on the following research thrusts: (i) Exploiting astrocyte computational models to evaluate the aspects of glial functionality crucial for self-repair in the context of neuromorphic machine learning platforms, (ii) Exploring spintronic device and circuit primitives to design a coupled neuron-synapse-astrocyte network capable of self-repair where the underlying device mimics the astrocyte functionality through their intrinsic physics, and (iii) Combination of the above top-down and bottom-up perspectives to leverage astrocyte self-repair in the context of hardware realistic faults like resistance drift, parasitic effects, device to device variations, among others in neuromorphic AI systems. The proposed research agenda, would provide proof-of-concept results toward the development of a new generation of efficient neuromorphic platforms that are able to  autonomously self-repair non-ideal hardware operation.

Non-technical Abstract:
Type-1 diabetes affects over 1.25 million people in the United States and its incidence is increasing every year. The majority of type 1 patients are not successful in achieving target blood glucose levels and control has actually been worsening in recent years despite expanded use of technologies. Inadequately controlled diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attack and peripheral vascular disease possibly leading to amputation and in some cases death. Joint use of a continuous glucose monitor and insulin pump is considered the current gold standard for management of type-1 diabetes. Existing technologies, however, suffer from two well-established limitations: high user burden due to the need for manual “meal announcements” to estimate insulin doses and low adherence to glucose monitoring devices due to the inconvenience of constantly breaking the skin for sensor insertion and irritation from the sensor adhesive. Thus, there is an urgent need in public health for fully automated, closed-loop glycemic control for type-1 diabetes patients, which will be the focus of the proposed research.

Technical Abstract:
The proposed work aims to develop and pilot a joint multimodal sensing system that can provide continuous noninvasive glucose monitoring data in addition to automated meal detection with an estimate of meal intake. Both types of information are necessary to inform artificial pancreas algorithms for prediction of bolus (i.e. short-acting) insulin dose needs. More specifically, the proposed system is in the form of an ear-worn device, tackling key systems and algorithmic challenges to realize a fully closed-loop artificial pancreas system. The intellectual merits of the proposed work are following. First, it will develop novel system designs to realize fine-grained, robust dietary sensing by fusing three streams of signals (i.e., bio-electrical signals, motion, and acoustic signals); Second, it will advance existing optical-based noninvasive glucose monitoring by addressing challenges of skin scattering and mitigating the impact of confounding factors and user diversity; Third, it will present new energy-efficient machine learning models dedicated to enabling local execution at micro-controllers, dealing with the limited number of labeled training data, and ensuring data privacy and communication efficiency; Finally, it will characterize and validate biological and behavioral biomarkers most relevant to diabetes management for implementing an artificial pancreas systems and develop new approaches for adaptive sampling and noise handling to ensure accurate monitoring of target events.

"As products change over time, so do the processes that manufacture them. At the beginning of the twentieth century, most consumer goods were made from natural fibers, wood, ceramics, and metal. As the century progressed, petroleum-based plastics became the preferred materials for most consumer products. Replacing petroleum-based plastics in the economy is a serious challenge, and converting renewable raw materials to recyclable products is critical. One goal of this project is to synthesize monomers (the building blocks of polymers) from biomass sugars.  Another goal is to design monomers that make polymers that are easy to recycle. The third goal is to demonstrate a digital light manufacturing (DLM) process that produces high-quality 3D-printed parts using those monomers. The ultimate objective is to cycle the monomers through the product and back to monomers, creating a circular path for the material, thereby reducing waste.  Also, interactive activities will be developed for K–12 and public audiences to demonstrate the circular material flow. 

Chemically recyclable photopolymerizable cycloolefin resins with properties tailored for DLM will be designed. The ability to form reversible polymer bonds will guide monomer design. Enzymes and microbial cells for biomanufacturing DLM monomers from renewable feedstocks will be developed based on polyketide synthases (PKSs). DLM processes for photo-polymerization of cycloolefin resins will be developed and improved. Photocatalyst systems, resin rheology, and instrumentation will be co-developed to digitally manufacture precision parts from circular cycloolefin resins. An extensive suite of mechanical tests will be carried out on structures printed from candidate resin formulations for both hard and elastomeric 3D-printed products, based on volumetric 3D printing via tomographic reconstruction. The rigidity, strength, and fracture toughness of 3D-printed cycloolefin resins will be benchmarked against leading conventional photopolymer resins, to guide material and process selection and maximize their impact on future manufacturing.

This project is jointly supported by the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering Program (ENG/CBET/CBE), the Synstems and Synthetic Biology Program (BIO/MCB/SSB) and the Chemical Catalysis Program (MPS/CHE/CAT).

"Broadening Participation Research Centers provide support to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to conduct broadening participation research and serve as national hubs for the rigorous study and broad dissemination of the critical theories, structures and pedagogies, as well as culturally sensitive interventions that contribute to the success of HBCUs in educating African American STEM undergraduates. The project at Morehouse College, in partnership with Spelman College and Virginia State University, seeks to formally establish the HBCU STEM Undergraduate Success Research Center – STEM-US. The mission of the center is to “understand and tell the stories of HBCUs through convergence research for us and the Nation; thereby, documenting the legacy of excellence in STEM education at HBCUs and contributing to future educational innovation”. Among higher education institutions, HBCUs have a sustained record of consistently producing a diverse group of graduates in the STEM fields who are prepared for further education and the STEM workforce. Through research, education, knowledge building, and outreach, this center will have an impact on STEM education reform and broadening participation at all HBCUs, but will also allow all of higher education, and thus society, to benefit from the experience and lessons of HBCUs in broadening participation.

STEM-US will conduct a systematic and comprehensive investigation to elucidate how HBCUs with diverse academic cultures successfully graduate African American students at a higher rate than other institutions; produce a higher rate of African American STEM students receiving PhDs; and instill in students a greater sense of well-being.  STEM-US will take a comprehensive approach that includes: 1) a strategy integrating research, education,  knowledge transfer and outreach to understand and disseminate, at local, state and national levels, the contributions, impact, and positive legacy of HBCUs in broadening participation; 2) a common theoretical framework that exposes individual and systematic vulnerabilities while developing the  institutional supports necessary to promote success and retention of students; and 3) research to support  the development of evidence-based interventions that will inform education reform. Specific research projects will emanate from a core research hub consisting of three partner institutions - Morehouse College, Spelman College and Virginia State University - as well as fifty other HBCU participants.

"Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at Delaware State University satisfies the requirements of a catalyst project in that it promises to implement a novel approach to STEM education and research at the institution.  Moreover, the project provides the PI with the opportunity to obtain preliminary results for the development of a research project that studies the impact of his interdisciplinary and inter-institutional/community approach for developing next-generation, undergraduate student researchers. 

In this project, the PI proposes an undergraduate research, innovation and education, infusion program, connected with citizen’s science.  The project promised to empower and prepare students at Delaware State University for the next-generation STEM workforce. This infusion program will bring together next-generation smart sensing technologies for environmental and human health, and advance manufacturing. These novel technologies are generally low-power, lightweight, portable and able to be deployed on ubiquitous platforms, including residential, urban or agricultural, and industrial locations. Several such technologies may include sensing and continuous monitoring of required physical, chemical or biological environments. These sensing systems when coupled with advanced manufacturing technologies, e.g. high-precision 3-D printing for human skin-electronic interface, or bio-compatible wearable sensors, can shift the paradigm of our interaction, and understanding of the outside world.  The broader impacts of this project includes undergraduate research, education and DEL-AWARE Citizens Science program that will involve various stakeholders, including diverse participants from academia, local environmental agencies/organizations, community group of participants from academia, local environmental agencies/organizations, communities, schools, hospitals and health services in the State of Delaware.

"In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Mark Muyskens of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Calvin University, and his team of undergraduate students, are investigating the properties of a broad class of bio-protective natural substances known as coumarins. Widely found in plants, coumarins have been shown to  have antiviral, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties, some of which may be linked to their proton donating ability, more commonly known as  acidity, and their interaction with light. Planned research includes a combination of computational and experimental studies.  The main goal of this project is to measure the acidity of a selected group of hydroxycoumarins in their electronic ground and excited states. Ground states are the resting state for a molecule; excited states are produced by absorption of a photon of light and are short-lived.   Some types of coumarins are photoacids, meaning that they become much stronger acids once they absorb light. These substances  can show pH-dependent fluorescence, a process in which excited states re-emit a photon of light. The mechanisms by which coumarins react with light, the structure-property relationships, and the extent to which we can use computer models to understand and predict coumarin acidity are expected products  of this investigation.  Results of this research have the potential to explain the beneficial role of coumarins in plants, and possibly extend that role also to humans. Coumarins also have potential applications as biosensors to reveal what is happening inside living cells.  The project is well suited to provide research opportunities for undergraduate students. Outreach activities to high school and middle school students, particularly supporting students from groups underrepresented in chemical fields, are also part of the project activities. 

 
The main goals of this project are to measure the ground state and excited state acidity of a representative group of hydroxycoumarins. These results will be used to create a structure-activity relationship between acidity and photoluminescence function of the coumarin.  The project involves a comprehensive study using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques to determine the photoacid properties of the selected coumarins, which comprise three groups: mono-hydroxycoumarins, di-hydroxycoumarins and coumarins structurally similar to the natural substance scopoletin.  Full characterization of a photoacid involves determining both the ground state and excited state acidity. A novel aspect of the project is the approach to determine experimentally the excited state acid properties using fluorescence spectroscopy. Furthermore, time-resolved fluorescence provides direct observation of the photodynamics of excited state molecules as well as a means to determine excited state rate constants for the proton transfer process. Additional products of this study are the fluorescence quantum yield and excited state  lifetime measurements for the target compounds. The experimental observations coupled with computational modeling using density functional theory offer a more thorough understanding of the photoacid and fluorescence characteristics of coumarins.

"In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Marcin Ptaszek of the Department of Chemistry at University of Maryland, Baltimore County, is developing an understanding of roles of electronic coupling on photochemical properties in biomimetic arrays for solar energy conversion. Natural photosynthesis remains the main inspiration for designing artificial systems for solar energy conversion. The arrays of strongly interacting pigments are the key components in the initial process of photosynthesis, i.e. solar radiation harvesting and initial charge separation. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes in photosynthesis and to establish the key design principles for development of artificial solar energy conversion systems, with efficiency comparable to (or better than) that observed for photosynthesis, the series of model arrays are prepared and characterized. This project combines advanced organic synthesis, spectroscopy, photochemistry and computational chemistry, therefore provides diverse educational opportunities for students at various levels. Special emphasis is devoted to involve students from underrepresented groups in science, and students from high schools.   

Excitonically coupled photo- and redox active molecules are the key components in photosynthetic arrays responsible for light harvesting and charge separation. The extent in which excitonic coupling determines the photophysical mechanisms underlying the highly efficient charge separation in photosynthetic arrays, and therefore its potential benefits for artificial photosynthesis, is not fully understood. The goal of the proposed research is to determine structure-photophysics relationships in excitonically coupled hydropoprhyrin arrays in order to develop an understanding of the role of an excitonic coupling in natural and artificial solar energy conversion systems. A series of dyads, composed of hydroporphyrins, i.e. synthetic analogs of photosynthetic pigments, featuring various modes of electronic interactions, are prepared, and the effect of varied electronic coupling on the physical properties of resulting arrays are determined. Subsequently, it is determined to what extent strength and mode of electronic coupling in hydroporphyrin dyads affect the energy and electron transfer dynamics in multicomponent arrays. Four specific aims are realized: (1) Determination of how molecular geometry and type of electronic interactions affect photophysical properties in excitonically coupled hydroporphyrin dyads; (2) Determination of effects of redox properties, metalation, and vibrational properties of hydroporphyrins as well as electronic asymmetry on photochemical properties of excitonically coupled dyads; (3) Determination of the role of excitonic coupling in electron transfers dynamics; and (4) Determination of energy and electron transfer dynamics in bio-inspired reaction center models.

"In this RUI project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Arsalan Mirjafari and his students of the Department of Chemistry & Physics at the Florida Gulf Coast University are developing new type of organic materials called ionic liquids.  Ionic liquids are liquid salts comprised entirely of ions. The search for new ionic liquids is driven in part by efforts to address unmet needs in medicine and energy.  Salts of this kind can be utilized as alternatives for more conventional organic solvents in various applications, including electronic materials, new generation of rechargeable batteries, and gene delivery. The project is designed to advance the scientific enterprise in tandem with educating and training undergraduate students to become the next generation of chemists. The project brings together elements of chemical synthesis, computer modeling as well as advanced materials development and characterizations, providing undergraduate students with opportunities to experience faculty-mentored research. Since Florida Gulf Coast University has a large underrepresented minority population in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields, the project provides important opportunities to engage in the professional training of individuals from these communities. Outreach activities involving local middle and high schools is part of the funded project as well.  

Fundamental to the field of ionic liquids is the understanding that structure begets function. In this project, Professor Mirjafari seeks the development of functional ionic liquids that simultaneously have improved fluidity and amphiphilic character – a combination of attributes that, while frequently antithetical, is very desirable in many applications. Click reactions are utilized to incorporate a diverse array of functional groups into the thioamide-based heterocyclic cations structures.  The research involves efforts to understand the relationships between the chemical structure and physicochemical properties and the development of ionic liquids for specific functions including aliphatic/aromatic separation, liquid crystals, fluoride-ion electrochemistry, and gene transfer.  New strategies are being pursued to improve the chemical stability and toxicity profiles of ionic liquids.

The Soft and Hybrid Nanotechnology Experimental (SHyNE) Resource NNCI site is the Northwestern University (NU) led collaborative venture with the Pritzker Nanofabrication Facility (PNF) of the University of Chicago (UC). SHyNE builds on each institution's long history of transforming the frontiers of science and engineering. Soft nanostructures are typically polymeric, biological, and fluidic, while hybrid represents systems comprising structures and hybrid materials comprising soft-hard interfaces. SHyNE facilities provides broad access to an extensive fabrication, characterization, and computational infrastructure with a multi-faceted and interdisciplinary approach for transformative science and enabling technologies. SHyNE provides specialized capabilities for soft materials and soft-hard hybrid nano-systems. SHyNE enhances regional capabilities by providing users with on-site and remote open-access to state-of-the-art laboratories and world-class technical expertise to help solve the challenging problems in nanotechnology research and development. SHyNE covers non-traditional industries: agricultural, biomedical, chemical, food, geological and environmental, among others. A critical component of the SHyNE mission is scholarly outreach through secondary and post-secondary research experience and integration with course/curricula as well as societal and public outreach through a novel nano-journalism project in collaboration with the Medill School of Journalism. SHyNE promotes and facilitates active participation of underrepresented groups, including women and minorities, in sciences and utilizes Chicago's public museums for broader community outreach. SHyNE leverages an exceptional depth of intellectual, academic, and facilities resources to provide critical infrastructure in support of research, application development, and problem-solving in nanoscience and nanotechnology and integrates this transformative approach into the societal fabric of Chicago and the greater Midwest.

Technical Description:
SHyNE is a solution-centric, open-access collaborative initiative with strong ties with Northwestern University's International Institute for Nanotechnology (IIN), in partnership with University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. SHyNE open-access user facilities bring together broad experience and capabilities in traditional soft nanomaterials such as biological, polymeric or fluidic systems and hybrid systems combining soft/hard materials and interfaces. Collectively, soft and hybrid nanostructures represent remarkable scientific and technological opportunities. However, given the sub-100nm length-scale and related complexities, advanced facilities are needed to harness their full potential. Such facilities require capabilities to pattern soft/hybrid nanostructures across large areas and tools/techniques to characterize them in their pristine states. These divergent yet integrated needs are met by SHyNE, as it coordinates Northwestern's extensive cryo-bio, characterization and soft-nanopatterning capabilities with the state-of-the-art cleanroom fabrication and expertise also at UC's Pritzker Nanofabrication Facility (PNF). SHyNE addresses emerging needs in synthesis/assembly of soft/biological structures and integration of classical clean-room capabilities with soft-biological structures, providing expertise and instrumentation related to the synthesis, purification, and characterization of peptides and peptide-based materials. SHyNE coordinates with Argonne National Lab facilities and leverages existing super-computing and engineering expertise under Center for Hierarchical Materials Design (CHiMaD) and Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute (DMDII), respectively. An extensive array of innovative educational, industry and societal outreach, such as nano-journalism, industry-focused workshops/symposia and collaborations with Chicago area museums, provide for an integrated and comprehensive coverage of modern infrastructure for soft/hybrid systems for the next generation researchers and the broader society.

"Recent findings suggest that intermixing with now-extinct relatives like the Neanderthals may have helped humans adapt to new environments during their rapid expansion around the globe, and may still contribute to human differences in disease susceptibility today. However, the extent to which benefits to hybridization are also found in other primates is not well understood. This doctoral dissertation project will use a model for natural hybridization in primates to investigate signatures of beneficial transfer of genetic variants between species. It will also ask whether hybridization affects hair color and maturation timing in baboons, traits that may be important in mate competition, fertility, or survival. The research will provide novel insight into hybridization’s role in primate evolution and shed light on how hybridization may influence primate diversity in the future. It will also contribute to STEM education at the elementary, undergraduate, and graduate levels through the design of new educational activities, mentored research opportunities for undergraduate students, and support for the co-PI’s PhD training. Finally, this project will facilitate public engagement with science through free-to-the-public presentations that will also be accessible online.

To investigate the potential benefits of hybridization in primates, the project will integrate genomic and observational data from wild baboons. It will test the hypothesis that hybridization facilitates the transfer of a small number of advantageous genetic variants between yellow baboons and anubis baboons. To do so, genomic data will be generated for multiple populations spanning a baboon hybrid zone. These data will be subjected to three complementary methods to identify genetic variants affected by adaptive introgression. Cases of potential adaptive introgression will be investigated for overlap with genes that are also differentially expressed between yellow and anubis baboons. The project also will test the hypothesis that genetic ancestry predicts hair color and maturation timing in a well-studied baboon population at the center of the hybrid zone. It will assess whether ancestry effects on these traits differ in number and magnitude across the genome, based on evidence that hair and skin color traits tend to have a simpler genetic basis than life history traits like maturation timing. Finally, the project will test whether regions in the genome that contribute to ancestry-related differences in hair color or maturation timing are candidates for adaptive introgression.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to empower researchers to make bio-structure discoveries by eliminating computational bottlenecks to shorten drug discovery cycles and time-to-market, such as those needed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most modern drug discovery projects start with protein target identification and verification to obtain a 'verified drug target'. Structural vaccinology is a rational approach to generate an effective vaccine. For instance, knowing the structures of the proteins on the surface of the virus can guide vaccine design, and knowing the structures of viral enzymes can lead directly to drug treatments that inhibit replication. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a method to image important structures. The proposed innovation enables fast classification of images and creation of 3-dimensional structures by using advanced deep learning techniques.  This will accelerate analysis and discovery by more than 50%. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project delivers an autonomous image processing pipeline for Cryo-EM data sets in real time at benchmark accuracies. On average, each cryo-EM microscope produces up to 2 TB of data daily. High-resolution image sizes from Cryo-EM are typically on the order of 10k x 10k pixels, requiring specialized software to process, classify and convert these images into 3D structures. Traditional fully supervised deep learning methods fail due to diversity of biomolecules and lack of labeled images. The proposed approach utilizes large-scale “deep unsupervised” learning methods that can train AI systems and deliver accurate results without labeled data on full resolution image sizes by use of High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. The project involves development of cloud infrastructure software that eliminates GPU memory limitations. Further, the proposed machine learning approach dramatically accelerates and improves cryo-EM particle picking, both in 2-D images from single particle reconstruction workflows and in 3-D images of intact cells in electron tomography workflows at benchmark accuracies.

"The well-being of humans and ecosystems relies on biodiversity on Earth. Diversity emerged because animals and plants use a fantastic variety of methods to survive in all forms of habitats. In the case of animals, survival depends crucially on their ability to move around. Most animals use fins in water, wings in air, and limbs on land. But these appendages have extraordinary morphological diversity and can be repurposed for novel functions such as using fins to walk and limbs to swim. This project will establish the Evolutionary Morphogenesis and Biodiversity (EMBody) Institute to drive discoveries on how appendages are formed and used in animals. Complex and poorly understood processes, ranging across levels of organization from molecules through cells to populations and in speed from milliseconds to hundreds of millions of years, drive the diversity of appendages. The EMBody Institute will use multi-disciplinary collaborations to produce novel techniques and tools to study the processes that shape animal appendages. Additionally, learning how animals move over diverse environments can lead to improvements in the design of robots used in disaster relief by land, sea, or air. Importantly, the Institute will foster a culture of inclusivity to broaden participation in research, education, and public engagement with science.

A central question in biology is how biodiversity on Earth emerged from the complex, multi-scale interactions of biological processes with the physical and chemical environment. The Evolutionary Morphogenesis and Biodiversity (EMBody) Institute will focus on animal locomotion and the remarkable diversity of propulsive appendages, essential for movement and survival in diverse habitats. This Design proposal aims to establish a collaborative community that integrates the multiple disciplines needed for propelling breakthroughs in understanding the evolution of morphogenesis in vertebrate appendages such as fins, limbs, and wings. Appendages develop through morphogenesis, a dynamical process that integrates genetic patterning with biochemical and mechanical regulation. Form enables function but does not dictate it. Rather, physical interactions with the environment, governed by mechanical principles and neural control, leads to function. Ultimately, natural selection operates on function, and the evolutionary transformation of ancestral gene regulatory networks yields novel forms and functions. From genes at the smallest level to selection on populations at the largest scale, this inextricable loop is the central theme of the EMBody Institute. The Institute will integrate experts from multiple disciplines and multiple levels of biological organization: (i) development that drives the emergence of diverse morphologies from shared gene networks through regulation, (ii) biomechanics that generates function by neural, musculoskeletal, and mechanical interactions, and (iii) evolution that transforms ancestral gene networks to yield novel morphology and function. The collaborative activities will generate and test novel hypotheses, innovative measurement methods, and unique datasets to benefit multiple scientific communities.

"This activity is in response to NSF Dear Colleague Letter Supporting Transition of Research into Cities through the US ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations Cities) Smart Cities Partnership in collaboration with NSF and the US State Department. Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), an ASEAN city in Vietnam, is well-known for its traffic congestion and high density of vehicles, cars, buses, trucks, and a swarm of motorbikes (7.3 million motorbikes for more than 8.4 million residents) that overwhelm city streets. Large-scale development projects have exacerbated urban conditions, making traffic congestion more severe. Additionally, traffic congestion is one of the leading contributors to noise and dust pollution in the city. Altogether, traffic congestion poses major barriers to urban quality of life, but the solutions are complex. There are two main problems with traffic in HCMC. First, HCMC, like other dense urban areas, needs significant financial and technical resources to solve its traffic and infrastructure problems. Second, given that traffic monitoring is carried out by a limited number of staff who watch traffic activities from thousands of camera feeds on multiple screens, there are limits to the number and effectiveness of responses that personnel are able to offer in response to real-time traffic problems.

The goal of this project is to use visual crowd AI sensing for the HCMC planning simulator. The project will make use of the city camera system (crowd-AI sensing) for traffic analysis in real-time. It seeks to detect “anomaly events” such as traffic violations, traffic jams, and accidents, with reduced intervention from monitoring staff, allowing staff, in turn, to better respond to traffic problems as they arise. A city planning simulator will be developed upon the analyzed traffic data. The simulator will be used to support metropolitan transportation planning. Project findings will not only address specific urban challenges and the innovative technical solutions needed to solve them in HCMC, but also will provide models use in other contexts, including U.S. cities where traffic, congestion, and urban infrastructure challenges can benefit from AI.

The project will be validated by professionals in HCMC who can evaluate its effectiveness for detecting anomaly events with reduced human observation, who are better able to respond to traffic problems as a result of implementing aspects of the project, and who can make use of the project data for traffic analysis.

"This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of Texas Dallas is acquiring an ultra-performance, electrospray ionization, mass spectrometer (UP-ESI-MS) to support Professor Jie Zheng and colleagues Jeremiah Gassensmith, Xianming Dai, Sheena D'Arcy and Yanping Qin. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples. In the electrospray technique a high voltage is applied to a liquid to create an aerosol. This is useful to produce ions from large molecules by avoiding the propensity of macromolecules to fragment when ionized. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students with this modern analytical technique. It is also used in outreach activities involving students and faculty from the University of Texas at Arlington, the University of North Texas, and other activities involving local high-school students.

The award of the mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts the discovery of atomically precise gold nanoclusters that can be used to unravel nano-bio interactions in the sub-nanometer regime and the optimization of wetting and adhesion in surface-chemistry. The instrumentation is also used for developing methodology for the synthesis and assembly of symmetric aromatic building blocks and for developing bottom-up proteomics for self-assembling, self-healing electronics. In addition, it benefits studies of non-covalent transition metal-protein complexes and the development of activity-based imaging and proteomic tools for biological sulfurylation. The mass spectrometer is also used to develop bottom-up and top-down hydrogen-deuterium exchange of protein complexes and to design small organic molecules to inhibit protein-protein interactions. The ESI spectrometer is also employed in studies developing methodologies for selective carbon–hydrogen bond functionalization of aromatic and aliphatic molecules and for characterizing synthesized natural product derivatives which could eventually improve manufacturing processes.

"This doctoral dissertation project examines biocultural questions about how relocation affects young adults' dietary behaviors and physiology over time. Scientists have observed that elevated stress and diet change are each associated with poorer metabolic function for resettled populations in some urban settings. However, social conditions that induce these changes, and the interactive impacts of stress and diet change, are often underexplored. Using existing survey data, new data, and biological sampling, this research will advance fundamental knowledge about biosocial mechanisms that shape human biological variation. Outcomes of this project will assist with interpreting root causes of health disparities in diverse societies and may inform public health research and policy. This project will also support student training, international research collaborations, and science outreach activities.

Biocultural research in anthropology includes questions about the physiological consequences of the nutrition transition in which highly processed, nutrient-poor fast food supplants local food systems. Other research complements this body of work by illustrating the challenges of adapting to a new society, including a new food system. This project proposes that social pressure to integrate into a new society induces stress and accelerates diet change to negatively impact young adult physiological well-being. Investigators leverage previously-collected survey data from when participants relocated as children, and follow up with them in adulthood using surveys, interviews, and health assessments. With this mixed-methods approach, the project is uniquely positioned to trace and compare how diet and physiology interact and respond to new social conditions. Pairing these analyses with a health assessment can further clarify how social pressures ""get under the skin"" to stratify health outcomes over the life course.

"This Dynamics, Controls, and System Diagnostics award will support fundamental research into the analysis and design of fish-like swimming robots, enabling the use of passively articulated body segments to sense ambient flow characteristics and respond to hydrodynamic stimuli. This type of embodied sensing and control of locomotion is seen in swimming animals like fish, where sensory awareness of velocity and acceleration is used as feedback for control. The project will also incorporate active and passive internal rotors to extend beyond more familiar bio-mimetic approaches. The project incorporates ideas from several disciplines and combines theoretical models, numerical simulations, and experiments to translate these ideas to mechanical systems. The new capabilities for swimming robots will be particularly significant for power-limited underwater robots in sensory-deprived environments. The results of the project will enable the design of improved underwater robots for exploration, search-and-rescue, and inspection and maintenance of underwater infrastructure. The project will provide research training and career preparation to doctoral students, offer research and educational opportunities for undergraduate students through design projects, and will reach out to K-12 school students to attract them to STEM disciplines.

This project seeks to investigate the role of passive degrees of freedom (PDOF) in aquatic robots that can act as both sensors and controllers. The dynamics of PDOF can encode the hydrodynamic forces and thus act as sensors. At the same time the motion of PDOF can be influenced by the hydrodynamic forces; if such motion is harnessed by appropriately designed PDOF, they can act as controllers. The project will improve our understanding of how the swimming systems state in a potential well encodes information about gaits and propulsive efficiency and how transitions between potential wells can be triggered by environmental disturbances or inputs that lead to fast and agile motion. The project will use machine learning methods to understand how the kinematics of a swimmer encode hydrodynamic information and how this can be used as part of multimodal sensory suite. Such embodied sensing and control would greatly reduce or in some cases bypass the role of electronic information processing and computation.  The concepts of embodied sensing in aquatic robots can be applied to existing designs of robots by augmenting existing sensors for better sensor fusion algorithms. The modeling framework will also directly be applicable to several classes of terrestrial mobile robotic systems, where passive self-stabilization and agility could be improved by employing PDOF for embodied sensing and control.  The specific research goals and plans will combine cross disciplinary modeling techniques from nonlinear dynamics, fluid mechanics, machine learning and bioinspired robotics.

"This grant supports research that will contribute new knowledge related to an additive manufacturing process, promoting both the progress of science and advancing national prosperity. Additive manufacturing, often called 3D printing, plays a pivotal role in the rapid design and fabrication of technological devices without the need for expensive tooling and long turnaround times. However, high-performance 3D printing of functional devices, such as energy-absorbing materials, wearable electronics, and morphing structures, remains a major challenge. Such limitations in performance are largely attributed to the difficulty in extruding highly functional inks and actively controlling their properties. This award supports fundamental research to provide knowledge for developing a 3D printing process that extrudes high-performance inks with tunable properties. The new printing technology will improve the performance of current 3D-printed devices and unlock new designs in material fabrication, bio-manufacturing, and customizable electronic production. Therefore, results from this research will greatly benefit the U.S. economy and society. This research involves multiple disciplines including fluid mechanics, microfabrication, and materials science. This transdisciplinary approach will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and promote equity and inclusion in engineering education.

Functional inks in 3D printing are often extremely viscous due to the required high filler content, and they often exhibit shear jamming that leads to catastrophic nozzle clogging. Moreover, the inability to alter ink properties, such as rigidity, conductivity, and thermal response, constrains manufacturing and thus inhibits the potential of realizing many new designs. To address such a challenge, this research will develop an understanding of and strategies for controlling functional ink properties via ultrasonic acoustic fields during extrusion. The hypothesis builds upon recent advances in thickening suspensions, in which high-frequency perturbations can be used to manipulate the microstructure of viscous fluids and substantially reduce their flow resistance. Specifically, this project will investigate the relationship between the mechanical properties of a particle-based model ink and the ink’s acoustically altered microstructure. The integration of these findings will lead to the development of design principles and perturbation protocols for building printing platforms. The project will explore two perturbation approaches: first, the simple attachment of a piezoelectric to a printing nozzle, and second, the engineering of an acoustic patterning device that precisely controls the ink microstructure. Collectively, these experiments will provide a foundation for developing active control of ink properties for printing functional devices.

"This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a state-of-the-art nanoscale characterization system to empower basic research in smart materials, thin films, and biomaterials at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU).  The project’s research findings may enable advanced bio-materials for enhanced medical treatments, novel electronic and smart materials with new functional capabilities and enhanced energy efficiency.  The system will enrich research collaborations—both within the university and with R&D small businesses-- and establish a pipeline of skilled nano-characterization researchers from a large and ethnically-diverse pool of graduate and undergraduate students. Nanotechnology will be introduced to K-12 students through STEM programs including Girls in Engineering Math and Science (GEMS).  Public understanding of nanotechnology will be heightened through an exhibit at the Daytona Beach Museum of Arts and Sciences.

The research is grounded in a physics- based approach and many of the projects are focused on materials and structures behaviors in harsh environments. The instrumentation will enable researchers to map the properties of heterogeneous biomaterials, 3D printed smart materials, and nanocomposite materials to their microstructure. The instrument will also enable unprecedented simultaneous characterization and imaging of phase-changing materials at the onset of their transition temperatures.    The researchers will  integrate the high temperature measurements with simulation to advance fundamental knowledge of thin films structural stability -- in collaboration with researchers at the national labs and at other universities. The instrumentation will lay the foundation for needed microstructure-properties- additive manufacturing processing correlations to establish the durability of 3D printed thick-film dielectrics and electric conductors for antennas and electronics under harsh environments. The system will also help establish  the elastic and viscoelastic properties of novel synthetic arterial grafts and shunts to ensure structural compatibility, achieve optimal compliance, and prevent cardiovascular malfunction.  The system will also provide crucial tribological insights of 3D printed dielectric metal-elastomers composites and establish their deformation-electric current constitutive behavior.

"Wireless systems with different radio access technologies (RATs) are becoming packed tightly in the space of radio spectrum. The carrier frequency and channel bandwidth of these systems, however, are drastically different across the spectrum domain, e.g., the IEEE 802.11 family that operates at 900 MHz, 2.4/5 GHz, and 60 GHz (mm-wave) bands, the 3GPP 5G family that spans 6-100 GHz, and more. Therefore, radio spectrum, which has long been identified as a scarce resource, will be more crowded and diversified than ever. Swift and effective spectrum sharing requires enhanced capability and increased intelligence at the wireless devices, from innovative transmitter and receiver technologies at the physical layer, to multi-band spectrum sensing across physical and MAC layer; from mapping spectrum slices for each access request, to radical modification of medium access control (MAC) protocols. Altogether, there is a need to support a myriad of heterogeneous devices that run diverse communication standards over different frequency bands to achieve efficient spectrum and energy utilization in such huge, dynamic and disparate systems.

This project mitigates the incoherent and disassociated frequency bands of the multi-RAT coexisting environments by exploiting the potential of cross-layer design from the circuits of transmitter and receiver, to the MAC layer with an innovative MAC-on-MAC spectrum control plane. This project has four major thrusts: (i) design of innovative transmitter and receiver techniques for energy-efficient multi-band spectrum monitoring, by using custom single-chip ultra-broadband (1-8 GHz) bio-inspired spectrum sensors to create a multi-band sensing solution that includes both sub-6 GHz and emerging mm-wave bands; (ii) methods to acquire complete spectrum occupancy information with a limited number of measurements from the proposed multi-band spectrum sensing circuits by exploiting matrix completion for low-cost, accurate and scalable monitoring through a learning-based sequential scheme; (iii) algorithms of obtaining a sorted ranking of paths that map a data flow to a range of spectrum slips by modeling spectrum-flow-RAT domains, finding the set of unoccupied spectrum slices, sorting out multiple recommendations from neighboring SAP control entities; (iv) creating MAC-Flow, a flow based network protocol that is capable of handling networking demands from both upper and lower layer, for both traditional user frames and for MAC-on-MAC controller processed frames for system-level performance evaluation. A holistic system-level integration of advances in spectrum detection, sensing, mapping with data flows, and implementation of MAC protocols is critical to improving spectrum utilization and user experience in coexisting wireless systems.

"With support from the Division of Environmental Biology (BIO/DEB) and the NSF 2026 Fund Program in the Office of Integrated Activities, Professor Alison Patteson of Syracuse University is awarded this EAGER grant. This project addresses the NSF 2026 Idea Machine topic of Emergence of Complexity from the Bottom Up, focusing on a subfield of the biological sciences. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the underlying principles governing emergent collective behavior in the model bacteria Myxococcus xanthus. Bacteria are often thought of as single celled, but many species act as multi-celled groups. Behaviors such as aggregation, swarming, and predation require cells to coordinate their actions. We know that the capacity for these behaviors is genetically controlled, but it is not yet possible to understand the resulting patterns from genetics alone. Cells rely on complex signaling pathways to sense, integrate, and respond to a variety of signals from other cells and from environmental cues to coordinate their behaviors. This project will produce a publicly available video archive of swarming behaviors in genetically distinct bacteria. This will provide a unique resource for developing models of emergent collective action and provide insights into the evolution of multicellularity.

This project employs two approaches. The first is to assemble a large video database of collective fruiting body aggregation in wild-type and mutant strains using a high-throughput video microscope. The second approach is to develop and extend self-propelled particle models of Myxococcus xanthus aggregation based on the effects of genetic knockdown on the resultant collective behavior. Identifying how bacteria self-organize from interacting signaling networks would be a significant step forward in understanding emergence in living materials.

"Yams (Dioscorea species) are among the primary agricultural commodities and major staple crop in Africa, India, South East Asia, South America and the Caribbean. However, the crop is laden with serious production problems arising from factors such as anthracnose disease, pests, and declines in soil fertility. This project seeks to revolutionize yam production in developing countries through the development and field-testing of low-cost genotyping/phenotyping biosensors that contain an integrated paper-based biobattery.  These proof-of-concept devices will provide self-sustainable, field-tested sensing systems that can be used to detect the presence of disease causing pathogens by smallholder farmers in the developing world. The project will provide international interdisciplinary research training for students and postdoctoral researchers. All project outcomes will be available for use by the scientific community. DNA sequences will be available through GenBank.  Information about biosensors will be provided through multiple mechanisms that include peer-reviewed publications as well as organized field-testing by smallholder farmers using standard protocols and handouts. 

This project will address some of the fundamental research and constraint issues associated with decreased yam production in developing countries. This project aims to develop and characterize the next generation of low-cost biosensors that can be used to assess differences in virulence and inter- and/or intraspecific genetic diversity in fungal isolates that cause anthracnose diseases in Dioscorea alata and Dioscorea cayanensis, two species of yams. Specific objectives are to (i) conduct molecular and biochemical characterization of healthy and fungal-infected yam varieties to identify DNA markers associated with up to 150-180 field-collected fungal isolates; ii) use markers as the basis for designing a multiplex SNP paper-based bioassay to detect the presence of fungal pathogens; iii) attach biosensor that is powered by a novel microbial-based bio-battery to the back of a smartphone; sensor signals could be read visually or via custom-based applications (apps) to be developed for smartphones; and, iv) develop standardized protocols for screening yams for anthracnose resistance using the new biosensing tools as a first step to deploying the technology in the field.  It is anticipated that the proposed devices can serve as a model for transforming low-cost tools into precision agriculture to promote increased food production in developing countries in developing countries. In addition, the project can potentially shift the paradigm for flexible and stackable paper-based batteries by enabling, through their architecture and design, exceptional electrical characteristics and functionalities.","Newark","New Jersey Institute of Technology","47.074","1","BM Gates Foundation","2044563","sadik@njit.edu","Omowunmi","Sadik","08/18/2020","07/01/2020","06/30/2021","BREAD PHENO: Development and Field Testing of Paper-based Biosensors to Increase Productivity of Smallholder Agriculture in Developing Countries","BIO"
"A critical measure of human physical and psychological health is relationship success. Effective communication has been shown to be a critical determinant of healthy relationships, but that does not translate uniformly across different sociocultural groups. Researchers acknowledge a number of significant challenges: sampling bias; an overreliance on the use of standardized measures developed among demographically homogenous samples; and the limitations of laboratory settings where couples are studied in brief interactions, and as isolated dyads. Anthropologists conducting ethnographic investigations of human relationships across diverse cultural and sub-cultural settings have repeatedly demonstrated that there is no single healthy way to engage in long-term partnerships, further showing that couples might better be understood as always embedded in and affected by complex and heterogeneous social, historical, and economic processes over time. Ethnographic research has only recently begun to investigate the linkage between such conditions and moment-to-moment biological processes, however, though current work suggests that physiological patterns of coregulation emerging in isolated interactions cannot necessarily be generalized to either a single relationship or to relationships as a general category. The current research thus deploys the theories and tools of biolinguistic anthropology, which has been developed in both pilot and large-scale studies by the PI and colleagues as well as graduate students at the University of Alabama and integrates human biology with ethnographic approaches in anthropology, in order to investigate the ways in which culture, biology, and experience co-emerge in moment-to-moment interaction among diverse couples over time. By incorporating a multi-scalar, longitudinal, and community-based approach, findings will contribute to a generalizable understanding of the range of everyday relationship ideologies across different sites. The research will further flesh out the science of emotional and physiological co- and counter-regulation by attending to and identifying specific sources of intra-individual and intra-couple variability over time. These findings will undoubtedly impact the future design of large-scale biolinguistic studies that significantly expand on the validity of laboratory studies of interaction and physiology among partners. As a CAREER project, it further provides funding for the training of both graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis. Knowledge generated by the research will also be integrated into shareable pedagogy in biolinguistic anthropology; an ongoing, collaborative UA-wide weekly seminar in biolinguistic anthropology; and age-appropriate educational workshops for both UA and the general public, including K-12 educational programs dedicated to helping children learn about the science of communication in local communities.

With the support of a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award, the researcher will conduct a multi-phase, longitudinal project investigating everyday ideologies of healthy relationships of more than 100 individuals in long-term partnerships in both the U.S. and East Asia. The sampling strategy incorporates several common denominators in order to ensure comparability and generalizability. Specifically, participants must be between the ages of 30 and 60, must live in medium to large urban environments, and must include at least one person works full- or part-time in the high-stress field of civic engagement. The first phase of the project consists of a community-based participatory approach that includes both anonymous surveys and remote interviews with up to 100 individuals who meet these criteria and are currently in a long-term partnership. This portion of the project assesses participants’ ideas about healthy relationships and communication as well as it aims to build upon the knowledge and experience of participants in order to ensure that the remainder of the project is based in stakeholder interests. The second phase of the project further includes an in-depth bio-ethnographic investigation of the ways in moment-to-moment interaction between partners is associated with time-matched physiological arousal in a year-long intensive study of 24 couples across multiple locales. This portion of the research combines ethnographic data collection; video-recording of naturally occurring interaction; collection of physiological data; multiple interviews; and participant-driven mobile ethnography over the course of a year. Ethnographic, video, and physiological data will be analyzed in an integrated digital platform to yield an empirical understanding of how embodied experience and physiological processes co-occur with communicative encounters at multiple timescales. In combination with data collected in the first phase of the project, it will further provide insight into how this co-occurrence is mediated by both shared and divergent ideas about healthy relationships among participants. Findings will not only enrich existing studies on communication, emotion, and health in anthropology, psychology, and related disciplines, but will also contribute to the transformation of theory and method in anthropology through the further development of biolinguistic anthropology as an approach that can be applied to study multiple phenomenon in which researchers seek to investigate the multi-directional, diverse, and varying processes through which culture, communication, and physiological regulation co-emerge in interaction over time.

"An award is made to Brown University to develop a new biological imaging technology, “micro-XROMM.” This microXROMM instrument will have ten times the precision of current XROMM  (X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology). Greater precision will open up new research areas to study the bones, joints, and muscles of animals that are too small for current XROMM, such as mice, frogs, bats and birds. MicroXROMM will enable discoveries such as how small frogs can jump so far and how the shoulders of bats can allow the amazing range of wing movements in flight. Such discoveries offer fundamental insights into the biomechanics of the natural world, and also form the basis for biologically-inspired engineering designs. This project will provide training for the next generation of instrumentalists by including undergraduate and graduate students in microXROMM design and testing. Students will be drawn from diverse communities including historically under-represented groups, thus recruiting the best available talent into science and technology development. Technology development projects such as this one increase US economic competitiveness through home-grown innovation.

In the field of Comparative Biomechanics, XROMM has opened up whole new areas of research on the skeletal kinematics of animal movements (walking, chewing, swimming, etc.). However, more than half of all vertebrate species are too small for current XROMM precision. The microXROMM instrument will have ten times the spatial precision of current XROMM (improved from 0.1 mm to 0.01 mm), and temporal precision will be at least 1 ms (1000 frames per second). The addition of microXROMM will open the door for XROMM research on speciose small-bodied groups such as rodents, bats, songbirds, tropical frogs, skinks, anoles, coral reef fish, gobies and minnows. MicroXROMM will enrich basic research in comparative biomechanics, bioinspired design and organismal and evolutionary biology more broadly. For example, microXROMM will be suitable for studying gene knockout mouse strains, making it particularly powerful for genome to phenome studies.

"Army ants are unlike any other ant species. They are nomadic and therefore do not build permanent nests. Instead, between two episodes of sometimes daily migration, they build temporary nests called “bivouacs” by attaching themselves to each other. In this way they build functional structures solely out of their interconnected bodies. Army ants can assemble and disassemble bivouacs of up to a million individuals in less than an hour and can do so in almost any condition in which they find themselves. These incredible feats of constructions are of great interest for engineers looking to create swarms of robots that could autonomously assemble themselves anywhere into any desired shape. Similar swarms could, for instance, self-assemble into habitats on Mars or in disaster areas without human intervention and regardless of the state of the local environment. This collaborative research brings together biologists and roboticists to achieve two goals: understand the principles of self-assembling construction in army ants, and adapt these principles to create a new generation of robots capable of self-assembling into any desired functional structure, even in unpredictable environments. The project will also give students from K12 to Ph.D. an opportunity to learn how biological structures build themselves out of smaller units, and how fundamental knowledge of natural processes can lead to new technological developments and applications in engineering. 

The project has three complementary components. In Component 1, the researchers will perform field experiments to determine the rules used by army ants to self-assemble into functional structures. These studies will combine computer vision-assisted behavioral observations to measure the individual behaviors of the ants and high-definition 3D imaging using a custom-designed CT-scanner to characterize the organization and dynamics of the structure under construction. In Component 2, the result of the field experiments will be used to generate a multi-agent mathematical model and a physics-based simulation of the ant behaviors. The focus will be to design generalizable agent abstractions that allow for mathematical analysis to determine what forms of individual rules lead to correct and efficient collective outcomes as determined by the functional goal (e.g. formation of bivouac), and how modification of individual sensing and coordination capabilities affect the colony capability. Finally, in Component 3, the researchers will design a self-assembling robotic swarm with at least 30 robots. The swarm will be capable of building functional structures in unknown environments, through climbing and attaching to each other. These robots will use similar principles as army ants for collective control and allow complex 3D “organic” self-assembled structures. The goal is not to mimic ant morphology, but instead demonstrate novel robot designs that use embodied intelligence and bio-inspired control, to achieve similarly adaptive structures while also allowing simplicity and large-scale manufacturability.

"Breathing in mammals occurs regularly throughout life without the need for conscious control. This remarkably robust behavior results from the activity of networks of neurons deep in the brain that interact to produce coordinated, rhythmic outputs that drive breathing.  Although certain aspects of this process are well understood, experiments have revealed features that go beyond existing theories, and this project will apply new modeling and analysis approaches to investigate these effects. A first set of issues that will be studied relates to the ways that specific patterns of respiratory neuron outputs emerge, change across development, and are affected by feedback signals. A second direction of investigation will focus on how activity spreads and becomes coordinated across a population of respiratory neurons, as needed to effectively drive the muscles that initiate each breathing cycle.  Additional avenues for research will involve the mechanisms of system-wide coordination across multiple populations of neurons that interact to produce the full breathing cycle over a range of conditions. The work will be completed in collaboration with experimentalists, and results of the project will lead to improved models to explain results of respiratory experiments and will generate new predictions. In addition to enhancing understanding of respiratory function and dysfunction, this project will have broad implications: theoretical methods developed to study the spread of coordinated activity will be relevant to other neural networks and to the spread of disease, opinion and information, while approaches for analyzing processes that evolve at very different rates will apply to other settings as well.  Trainees contributing to this research will gain experience in using computational methods to address data-driven questions in neuroscience. Methods and findings developed will contribute to the training of students via local group meetings and courses and will be disseminated more broadly via publications, presentations, and model sharing.

Rhythmic activity of networks of neurons underlies a wide range of repetitive behaviors such as walking, scratching, and breathing. This project will address rhythm generation, coordination, and control via a focus on neuronal networks in the mammalian brainstem associated with respiration. In the rhythms that these networks produce, multiple populations of neurons take turns activating at specific relative times and with specific activity patterns within each breathing cycle, and the activity within each population rapidly synchronizes when it arises.  This work will analyze how activity with complex dynamic features, called bursting, arises in specific neurons and subsequently spreads across the population in a particular brainstem region during the inspiratory phase of breathing. Analysis of the bursting patterns, which will be done across multiple stages of development, will involve novel mathematical analysis of the dynamics of systems with components that evolve on several distinct timescales.  The resulting theoretical advances will have implications for the study of other biological and physical systems with multiple timescale dynamics. New results will also be attained, using mathematical and computational methods, about how the coordination of bursting across the network depends on the pattern of connections across the neurons involved and the properties of the synapses through which these neurons communicate.  These advances will also have broader applicability to other processes involving the spread of activity in a network from a small set of local initiation sites. Finally, this project will include investigation of coordination of activity across multiple neuronal populations to produce functional respiratory outputs, including issues of flexibility and robustness under changes in feedback signals due to environmental or metabolic demands. These steps will be guided by novel experimental data, will involve collaboration with experimentalists, and will result in advances in basic understanding as well as predictions about alterations underlying certain respiratory dysfunctions. The project will include diverse graduate students and undergraduates who will gain valuable research training, will impact educational efforts, and will lead to dissemination of results and model sharing.

"Given the proliferation of wireless devices, sensors, and computers in our world, the efficient utilization of the electromagnetic spectrum is of paramount importance.  This project will support the acquisition of a continuous-wave characterization instrument at Oklahoma State University (OSU) to address the well-known and longstanding gap in electromagnetics and communications research of the utilization of millimeter-waves and terahertz frequency waves. The MRI instrument offers unique capabilities that have the potential to tackle the fundamental research problems blocking the development of high-performance communication, sensing, and imaging technologies.  The MRI instrument will enable research on the fundamental physics behind novel magnetic materials which could speed up computer memory and produce more power-efficient architectures.  It  also has the potential to bring new ideas on next-generation wireless communication studies that may advance the current state-of-the-art in terms of speed and data capacity for air-to-air and air-to-ground communications with unmanned aerial vehicles.  Finally, it will likely advance the field of compact imaging systems, providing a means of developing new machine vision techniques that work when radar, visible, and thermal infrared do not.  Apart from these technological benefits, the instrument will enable unique educational opportunities for the next generation of engineers and scientists, including training and outreach opportunities for high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students, teachers, and scientists through the OK-LSAMP (OK Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation), the OSU National Lab Day, and the OSU Summer Bridge programs. The instrument will also underpin new lab modules in communication and microwave classes at OSU. Technology transfer and research progress based on the MRI instrument will be enhanced by a volunteer advisory committee consisting of the PIs and industry and university experts.
The MRI characterization instrument will enable  narrowband transmission/reflection measurements and wideband, arbitrary waveform measurements in the 0.11-0.50 THz range with sub-500 kHz frequency resolution and 120 dB dynamic range.    Specific goals include the use of the instrument to develop research contributions in the following areas:
•	Development of artificial materials with high quality factor electromagnetic responses based on anapole and bound-in-the-continuum concepts.  These will be experimentally explored with high frequency resolution leading to new and high-performance designs of mm-wave and terahertz chem/bio sensors.
•	The physics of high frequency quasiparticle dynamics in chiral and anti-ferromagnetic materials, spin-Hall auto-oscillators, and resonance spin-wave spectroscopy.  These studies will advance fundamental understanding of quantum materials and lead to faster and more power efficient computing architectures. 
•	Propagation channel emulators for 5G and beyond wireless communications using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).  These studies will provide new empirical channel models, providing the engineering foundation for UAV-based communication networks in unpredictable environmental conditions.
•	Realtime behaviors of multichannel transmitters and active radar transceiver arrays.  These measurements will validate the improved performance, efficiency, and reliability of mm-wave integrated circuits for high-bandwidth communications and active imaging.

The instrument will be set up for a variety of different measurement types by leveraging the existing millimeter-wave and terahertz infrastructure at Oklahoma State University and made available to both internal and external users.

"Imagine using microbe-killing materials, structurally similar to insect wings, on hospital and kitchen surfaces. Or generating cheetah-level speeds and power in robots as small as ants. Finding ways to apply natural principles to real-world problems is the goal of bioinspired design. The objectives of this proposal are to develop research, teaching and public engagement activities that will form the basis for creating a future Institute for Bioinspired Design. Specific goals include: 1. Describe and apply mechanical and material properties seen in nature to engineering principles for real-world problems; 2. Develop an educational model aimed at training interdisciplinary teams of scientists; and 3. Actively engage the public in all aspects of this work through public seminars, videos, and the development of K-12 curricula. The field of bioinspired design is highly interdisciplinary, and requires integrating distinct expertise in engineering, materials science, chemistry and biology. However, current training and educational models are often insufficient to prepare the next generation of scientists to work seamlessly across disciplines. This future Institute will serve as a home for interdisciplinary teams to come together quickly and solve societal problems and grand challenges by using best practices of bioinspired design while training the next generation of scientists active in bioinspired design.


Bioinspired design involves using nature as a guide to inform technological innovation. Successfully applying biological principles to innovative design requires integrating across all biological scales: from molecular and cellular processes, to whole organisms, and even ecosystems. The objective of this Design Proposal is to develop research, teaching and outreach activities that will form the basis for a future Implementation Proposal for creating an Institute for Bioinspired Design. The creativity required to identify real-world applications of biological analogs, or to recognize which problems can be successfully tackled with biologically inspired solutions, necessitates meaningful interdisciplinary exchange between those working across different disciplines including biology, chemistry, physics, art, design, engineering and business. For bioinspired design to be successful, we also need a novel educational model to train diverse teams of researchers to work together effectively, and to collaborate on creating original projects from discovery to design.  The planned future institute can address not only improvements and advances in bioinspired design but can serve as a model of integrated biological research that moves beyond biology to integrate with other disciplines facilitating both scientific and societal advances.

"In addition to health and safety concerns, the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had significant impacts on human behavior worldwide, from business and school closures to stay-at-home orders. As a consequence there have been unprecedented and precipitous drops in global travel for work, education, recreation, and other daily activities. The associated declines in fossil fuel consumption and pollution emissions have resulted in improved air quality. Reductions in atmospheric contaminants (particularly nitrogen, N) and deposition of pollutants must also be influencing nutrient cycling and impacting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem processes. The situation has created a completely novel and large-scale ""human experiment"" in how sudden changes in socio-economic behavior and mobility patterns may influence the environment. To better understand environmental changes associated with the pandemic, this NSF RAPID project will focus on studies of coastal and estuary aquatic habitats, which are known to be particularly biologically productive and diverse. Researchers will measure key biogeochemical (nutrient) and ecological (phytoplankton, bacteria) metrics using water sampling and satellite observations of an urban estuary on the east coast of the US over the COVID-19 shutdown and reopening periods. This project will also train postdoctoral scholars and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups in science, while enhancing the understanding of connections between societal activity and coastal ecosystems.

Steep declines in the concentration, thus deposition, of atmospheric pollution (particularly N), combined with shifts in wastewater effluent distribution associated with the COVID-19 shut-down are expected to influence the biogeochemistry and ecology of adjacent coastal waters. Since the dominant N-form, and stoichiometric ratios relative to other nutrients, shape phytoplankton and bacterial community structure, sudden changes in nutrient amounts, quality, and source distribution in an urban estuary could translate to regime shifts in microbial assemblages and biogeochemical processes. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that the sudden decline in human activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic will exert considerable and measurable effects on coastal biogeochemical and physical water quality parameters as well as phytoplankton and bacterial assemblages. While this hypothesis is broadly applicable to developed coastlines worldwide, this study will focus on Long Island Sound (LIS) because it (i) borders the greater New York City (NYC) metropolitan area, specifically the commuting corridor between NY and Connecticut (CT), (ii) is heavily urbanized, (iii) was especially hard-hit by COVID-19, and (iv) NY and CT were among the first states to mandate stay-at-home restrictions, leading to surrounding communities drastically downscaling transportation activity. The research addresses three questions: 1. Have recent changes in human activity (improved air quality and concurrent changes in wastewater inputs) been associated with shifts in key biogeochemical metrics (C, N, P, Si) and stoichiometric ratios? 2. What are the corresponding responses of phytoplankton and bacterial assemblages? 3. How do these changes relate to shifts in bio-optical properties? To answer these timely ecosystem-scale questions, the team will measure key water quality and biogeochemical parameters, as well as evaluate the abundances and composition of phytoplankton and bacterial assemblages. Work will leverage regional water and air quality monitoring and past and ongoing water sampling in LIS. Satellite ocean color imagery will be used to scale-up observations from point measurements to the larger ecosystem.

"Next-generation micro- and avian-scale unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) must navigate unsteady environments and undergo rapid maneuvers. During the same operational conditions that may render UAVs inefficient and unstable, birds and insects are not only able to remain aloft, but can also maintain their aerodynamic efficiency. Inspired by a system of feathers on a bird’s wing, this work will enable a flow control technique that can passively adapt to and alter unsteady flow phenomena. Current flow control strategies involve relatively heavy devices that must be actively powered and require costly, complex information about the flow. In contrast, the proposed feather-inspired effectors do not require additional power to be deployed, and their ability to passively respond to unsteady flow phenomena offers a compelling low-weight, adaptive, and simple flow control paradigm.  The fundamental flow physics that govern this effector system will be explained to enable its use in future aerodynamic vehicles. The bio-inspired nature of this work presents a prime opportunity for STEM training, recruitment, and outreach. Broader impacts of this work include university level training (via undergraduate and graduate student mentoring as well as course development) and K-12 outreach (via summer engineering workshops targeted towards underrepresented minority students).

High-fidelity simulations and detailed experiments of a canonical system involving an airfoil with effectors hinged at the root via a torsional elastic spring will be performed. This effector system constitutes a poorly understood fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem. The flap dynamics will be related to the shear layer and wake dynamics and quantify the impact of this interplay on aerodynamic performance for different flap parameters, airfoil angles of attack, and Reynolds numbers. Simulations will be carried out at low Reynolds numbers, Re = 1,000, relevant to micro UAVs and insect flight. Experiments will be conducted at higher Reynolds numbers, Re ≈ 200,000, relevant to avian-scale UAVs and bird flight. Over this range of Reynolds numbers, a single flap hinged with a zero-stiffness torsional spring will be first studied and the passive flap dynamics to the shear layer dynamics, near-body and wake vortex dynamics, and aerodynamic forces will be corelated. Then, it will be examined how these FSI physics are affected by a finite stiffness torsional spring and relate any changes to resonant and non-resonant mechanisms associated with the elastic flap system. Finally, a multi-flap system will be studied to determine how multiple flaps interact in this FSI setting to alter the resultant aerodynamic forces.

"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY
 
To effectively treat disease, drug molecules must accumulate in sufficient amounts at a specific site in the body. To achieve this, tiny vehicles called carriers are often needed, but unwanted interactions within the body often limit their effectiveness. This project uses knowledge of the molecular interactions between bacterial/viral pathogens and human cells during human infection to design bioinspired polymer coatings for drug carriers. The project will provide deeper insight into chemical structures that simultaneously limit biofouling on the carrier surface and enhance attachment of carriers to human cells. Longer term, these results will enable the development of nanocarriers that can provide better treatment of disease by decreasing the amount of drug required for treatment and limiting side effects. This project will have a direct impact on the educational experience of students at various levels. Two graduate students will perform research for their Ph.D. theses and several undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will participate in the research. Further, a K-12 outreach program in engineering and science will utilize concepts from the research during camps throughout the state of Iowa and provide graduate and undergraduate students with opportunities for teacher training. Research results and discoveries will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at local, national, and international conferences.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY
 
Current drug delivery strategies to target specific cells within the body are plagued by low levels of drug accumulation in the areas they are most needed. When drug carriers enter the body and interact with biological fluids, biofouling of the carrier surface occurs and new surface properties develop that control the carrier’s subsequent bio-interactions and fate. Our lack of knowledge of how to design drug carriers with appropriate properties to trigger and mediate their interactions within complex biological environments has significantly hindered progress towards efficient drug delivery. The goal of this proposal is to design a surface coating for nanocarriers to simultaneously address issues of biofouling and cell uptake in complex biological environments. Bioinspired polymeric ligands containing molecular structures that mimic the surfaces of respiratory pathogens known to efficiently penetrate human fluids and the lung epithelium will be developed. The ability of ligand-coated nanoparticle to target lung epithelial cells submerged in natural secretions will be experimentally observed and quantified. Two independent techniques will be pursued to evaluate the molecular recognition of the ligands. First, a high-throughput, optical biosensor technique will quantify the real-time cellular responses to receptor-ligand interactions in living cells. Second, a 3-D homology modeling approach will elucidate the ability of the ligands to dock into the receptor binding pocket. Results from these studies will provide insight into chemical structures that mediate the binding and activation of receptor-mediated processes. Through biomolecular mimicry, the proposed studies will lead to more efficient design of ligands that will enhance nanocarrier delivery.

This project is jointly funded by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Polymers Program in the Division of Materials Research.

"RNA nanostructure design has received unprecedented attention due to the number of emerging applications in different scientific fields, such as diagnostics, therapeutics, synthetic biology, biological materials, and molecular programming. However, the design and synthesis of long RNA molecules with improved stability, programmable geometries, and controllable functions is an incredibly challenging task. The difficulties of large RNA design are due to their long sequences and complex interactions between bases. In addition, once a structure is designed, conducting experiments is time-consuming and expensive. It is invaluable to develop a platform with effective design algorithms and tools for RNA design with high efficiency and accuracy. This project will advance national health prosperity and welfare, providing the required knowledge for the design and synthesis of long RNAs with the desired functionalities and improved stabilities. These RNAs will have an important potential impact in applications such as drug delivery and cancer therapy. The team will develop new computational methods enabling support to the discovery of next-generation nanostructure in a more efficient and informed manner. It will also improve the understanding and knowledge of fundamental rules that characterize the folding of large-scale RNA sequences. The project will involve algorithm development along with experimental activities. As a result, educational material will be developed across science and engineering programs bringing a diverse group of students together.

Most existing RNA-design algorithms focus on conserved, naturally evolved 3D RNA motifs. These algorithms employ the idea of a “block”, which consists of nucleotides (nts) at the scale of ~10nts, and investigate the possible bindings among nucleotides pairs within and between the blocks (block-driven approach). Current approaches suffer from the low accuracy for prediction of large RNA molecules folding (>200 nts). This is a critical issue because there is a compelling need to generate longer sequences to fully exploit RNA functionalities such as catalysis, gene regulation, organization of proteins in large machineries, and their use in material and biomedical sciences. Several challenges make the task of designing large-scale RNA structures hard. As an example, RNA compounds can be stable even when they are not minimum free-energy configurations. Also, experiments have shown how alternative configurations can exist for the same RNA sequence, with different associated levels of minimum free energy. It is therefore necessary to come up with approaches, experimental as well as computational, that can be agnostic to a reward function, e.g., embed data-driven information to determine the likelihood of an RNA configuration to exist. This multidisciplinary project will tackle two main challenges for the development of the design of RNA structures. (i) Perform optimization without explicit knowledge of a reward function. The concept of optimization driven by empirically developed experts will be developed in this project. (ii) Scale the methods in (i) to high-dimensional cases. A bio-inspired concept of tile is employed to create a computationally efficient algorithmic framework to generate and explore tiles, which will be evaluated using expert-driven rollout over chains of tiles. The produced algorithms will be subsequently validated using existing RNA databases. New RNA building blocks will be proposed and constructed through the algorithmic framework, to be validated as an assistant tool to the design of single-stranded RNA origami structures with increasing size and complexity that could potentially rival the natural RNA machineries or designer DNA nanostructures.

This project will advance national health prosperity and welfare, providing the required knowledge for the design and synthesis of long RNAs with the desired functionalities and improved stabilities. These RNAs will have an important potential impact in applications such as drug delivery and cancer therapy. The team will develop new computational methods enabling support to the discovery of next-generation nanostructure in a more efficient and informed manner. It will also improve the understanding and knowledge of fundamental rules that characterize the folding of large-scale RNA sequences. The project will involve algorithm development along with experimental activities. As a result, educational material will be developed across science and engineering programs bringing a diverse group of students together.

Most existing RNA-design algorithms focus on conserved, naturally evolved 3D RNA motifs. These algorithms employ the idea of a “block”, which consists of nucleotides (nts) at the scale of ~10nts, and investigate the possible bindings among nucleotides pairs within and between the blocks (block-driven approach). Current approaches suffer from the low accuracy for prediction of large RNA molecules folding (>200 nts). This is a critical issue because there is a compelling need to generate longer sequences to fully exploit RNA functionalities such as catalysis, gene regulation, organization of proteins in large machineries, and their use in material and biomedical sciences. Several challenges make the task of designing large-scale RNA structures hard. As an example, RNA compounds can be stable even when they are not minimum free-energy configurations. Also, experiments have shown how alternative configurations can exist for the same RNA sequence, with different associated levels of minimum free energy. It is therefore necessary to come up with approaches, experimental as well as computational, that can be agnostic to a reward function, e.g., embed data-driven information to determine the likelihood of an RNA configuration to exist. This multidisciplinary project will tackle two main challenges for the development of the design of RNA structures. (i) Perform optimization without explicit knowledge of a reward function. The concept of optimization driven by empirically developed experts will be developed in this project. (ii) Scale the methods in (i) to high-dimensional cases. A bio-inspired concept of tile is employed to create a computationally efficient algorithmic framework to generate and explore tiles, which will be evaluated using expert-driven rollout over chains of tiles. The produced algorithms will be subsequently validated using existing RNA databases. New RNA building blocks will be proposed and constructed through the algorithmic framework, to be validated as an assistant tool to the design of single-stranded RNA origami structures with increasing size and complexity that could potentially rival the natural RNA machineries or designer DNA nanostructures.

"Synthetic biology is currently used to develop advanced medical treatments using engineered bacterial consortia.  Bacteria are able to exquisitely fine-tune their growth rate to their environment, responding  efficiently to sudden environmental changes. Abundance of ribosomes in a cell correlates tightly with the growth rate, and growth rate is controlled by the abundance of ribosomes that translate mRNA into protein. This biopolymerization process is influenced by an interconnected web of both direct and indirect feedbacks that depend on both transcription of genes and translation of ribosomal mRNA. Transcription and translation rates play a key role in response time of the microbe to changing conditions. This research seeks to develop a comprehensive mathematical model to describe ribosome assembly and abundance control in bacteria. The project emphasizes the integration of a broad knowledge of molecular biology, principles of physics, mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis of a complex biological system.  Both undergraduate and graduate students will be trained to use tools from mathematics and physics within the broad field of systems biology, thereby contributing mathematicians with interdisciplinary skills towards the national goal of STEM workforce development.
 
A new continuum model will have the flexibility to describe three biopolymerization processes: transcription of ribosomal RNA, transcription of mRNA of ribosomal proteins and the translation of ribosomal proteins. The model for each process is referred to as an individual compartment within the full assembly model.  The prototypical compartment is a generalization of vehicular motion models, and it provides a mechanism for including inflow and outflow phenomena as well as torque-assisted transcription when appropriate.  The full ribosome assembly model is described by a system of ordinary differential equations whose variables are related to the outputs of the individual compartments. The full model also includes a set of feedbacks that regulate initiation and translocation rates governing the dynamics occurring within each compartment. Ribosome production rate is the key determinant of bacterial growth rate, and it depends on several fundamental quantities including the response time after a nutritional up-shift or down-shift, the combined time of transcription and translation, and the time to produce a ribosome. Several system parameters exhibit inherent uncertainties due to the stochastic nature of availability of various enzymes. The project includes a sensitivity analysis effort to quantify effects of the most crucial system parameters on each fundamental quantity. Examining these effects and their variability  allows one to determine the average community response of bacteria to its environment. The variability in microbial community response to antibiotic application is often an important determinant of antibiotic effectiveness.

"The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology-Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (CREST-PRF) track within the CREST program supports beginning CREST Center investigators with significant potential and provides them with training and research experiences that will broaden perspectives, facilitate interdisciplinary interactions and establish them in positions of leadership within the scientific community. This CREST-PRF project is aligned with the research focus of the CREST Center for Complex Materials Design for Multidimensional Additive Processing (CoManD) at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU). The goal of this research is to use 3D printed matrixes to study cells in an environment that mimics a natural environment. Using techniques at FAMU and Harvard University, the research will allow a study of cells in a controlled environment. Research techniques and results will be used to create course modules in engineering courses at FAMU.  The work will allow the researcher to build a foundation for an independent research career. The larger community will be impacted through demonstrations at middle and high schools to engage students in the community. 

Tissue regeneration/repair can often involve the interaction of multiple cell types with different characteristic extracellular matrices (ECM).  Such is the case for tendon repair where the tendon-to-bone interface is composed of a transition from aligned fibers in the ligaments to randomly oriented in the bone.  Extrusion printing hydrogel scaffolds allows the implementation of pore size, modulus, and even compositional gradients all in one scaffold to create complex cellular environments seen in the body.  Consequently, the goal of this work is to use the versatility of extrusion printing to probe tissue regeneration at complex multicellular interfaces.   Using a 3D bio printer with a novel microfluidic modified print head and mounted UV lamp, hydrogel scaffolds will be printed for tissue regeneration.  This work will focus on the tendon-to-bone multicellular transition demonstrating tunable structural, mechanical, and biochemical properties in a printed scaffold.  Extrusion printing and cell studies will present new insights into cell behavior in a complex matrix.  By studying this system in a 3D matrix we will be able to probe cell proliferation, migration, and viability in an environment with a closer resemblance to the native extracellular matrix. In addition, through the combination of confocal Raman spectroscopy and the microfluidic technique, this work will investigate and subsequently tune matrix stiffness, anisotropy, and permeability in order to effectively study growth and migration of cells with controlled physical and biochemical cues. The proposed work will serve as a model system for a variety of tissues/organs that require the spatial regulation of cells, nutrients, or growth factors for effective regeneration.

"The project enables the use of unique programmable wireless, optical, and edge-cloud network testbed infrastructure for international collaborative experiments. It builds on the interfaces of the PAWR COSMOS (NYC) and ORBIT (NJ) testbeds with the PEERING (US/International) and FABRIC (US) testbeds, and adds connections to international testbeds, including CPQD (Brazil), Kyutech/StarBED (Japan), OneLab/NITOS (EU/Greece), and CONNECT (Ireland). To support cross-layered international experiments, unique capabilities are developed, including optical and BGP extensions to the Mininet network emulator, and PEERING testbed tools for cross-layer BGP functions and controlled public Internet experimentation.

The project creates a powerful international experimental platform for networking research from applications down to the optical and radio physical layers. A few distinct example experiments that demonstrate various capabilities and motivate further experimentation include: (i) Artificial Intelligence for multi-layer Quality of Service over disaggregated infrastructure during remote scientific experimentation; (ii) cloud processing of latency- and capacity-sensitive mobile applications across network domains and testbeds; and (iii) interdomain routing, data security, and privacy across national boundaries.

A strong outreach component aiming at broadening participation in computing involves local Harlem middle and high school teachers in research and in development of educational components. Finally, the development of emulation-based sandbox capabilities for international experiments promises to make such large-scale experiments more accessible to a wide range of researchers. Therefore, and due to the availability of a unique international infrastructure, the project has the potential to support experimentation that enhances the performance of future networks and helps bridge the digital divide.

"This award will enable the Morton Arboretum to design a Biology Integration Institute that will take a multidisciplinary approach to understanding and predicting whole tree responses to rapid environmental changes, including emerging climates, biotic invasions, and urbanization, across organizational (i.e., from molecules to ecosystems) and temporal scales (i.e., from moments to generations). Trees shape terrestrial environments, both in natural and built environments, creating forests and woodlands and play a major role in global water, carbon, nutrient, and energy cycles. With their extensive root systems and expansive leaf canopies, they integrate above and below ground conditions, linking the soil and sky through a dynamic biotic system.  Tree responses to these emerging novel environments - be it an urban parkway or an increasingly dry woodland - also alter the environment they live in and generate biological innovations in traits, genes, behavior, community composition, and clades. A synthetic approach is necessary to understand these complex and contingent systems and tease apart questions of nature versus nurture and how we might best manage trees in the future. During the Design phase, the project will enhance the current undergraduate research and public outreach activities of the institution, especially with regard to individuals who are underrepresented in the sciences. 

Trees, as a growth form, are a great model system for integrative biology and the study of biotic response to environmental change. Not only do they dominate terrestrial ecosystems and form the fundamental ecological and evolutionary basis for many ecosystems, they possess numerous compelling biological characteristics making them particularly good integrators of environmental change. The researchers will design a Biological Integration Institute focused on the theme of “how trees respond to and shape novel environments.” They will leverage the unique research and training resources of a large public botanic garden encompassing urban, managed, restored, and remnant ecosystems. In the Design phase, the researchers in the Center for Tree Science will work with internal and external experts to: 1) Clarify a core overarching question, identify opportunities for synergy in existing projects, and prioritize new cross-disciplinary collaborative research teams and projects; 2) Create a management plan and strategies for data integration and collaboration that allow for interdisciplinary cross-talk, including designing an integrative database that builds on lessons from prior NSF investments; and 3) how to leverage the Arboretum’s existing integrated training and mentorship program in tree science, which prepares students and early career scientists for interdisciplinary, collaborative careers across a range of fields and agencies.

"This Design activity will result in a proposal to create a Biology Integration Institute that will synthesize recent advances in wildlife virology and pursue new insights about the ecology and evolution of the global virome. The pandemic emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is only the latest development in an accelerating trend of dangerous viruses emerging from wildlife. Global travel, urbanization, and increasing human-wildlife contact have all made it easier for these viruses to emerge. In the future, climate change and land use change will reassemble the global virome even further, forcing mammals to cross continents, meet in new ecosystems, and exchange viruses thousands of times more, potentially unleashing even more threats to global health. At least 10,000 of these mammal viruses might have the potential to infect humans, but most of the global virome is still undescribed: only about 1% of mammal viruses have been discovered, and a much smaller fraction in other vertebrates. With so little data, it is difficult to predict which viruses will pose a future threat, or where, when, and how they could emerge. Predicting the next pandemic threat will require new data spanning biological scales, from single genes up to deep evolutionary time, and new statistical methods from the cutting edge of computer science and mathematics. In addition, the project will host summer residencies for trainees  and develope new coursework that combines biology with hands-on computer science labs.

The project assembles a group of virologists, computer scientists, statisticians, and ecologists to explore cutting edge scientific questions about methodology, inference, and impact. The project has three aims: (1) synthesizing existing data about host-virus associations for all vertebrate clades; (2) developing novel approaches to predict host-virus interaction networks, using novel data streams like viral strain diversity characterized from genomes, or receptor data from immunological studies; and (3) developing frameworks for actionable science that will put viral ecology to use for global health science and security. These aims will be accomplished through collaborative workshops. In doing so it will establish a foundation for a full Implementation proposal to develop an Emerging Virus Institute.

"This doctoral dissertation project examines how habitat fragmentation affects wild female chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), specifically assessing the consequences of forest fragmentation and food availability on female behavior and reproductive performance. The project will advance fundamental knowledge about species responses to environmental change. In addition, as human land use rapidly alters  forests, understanding how primates cope with habitat loss and fragmentation is of paramount import to their successful conservation. Results will help stakeholders develop and adopt efficient management plans for forest fragments to ensure the protection of chimpanzees and related biodiversity. This project also presents opportunities for training through public outreach and by engaging undergraduate students in field data collection and analyses. 

This study will take advantage of two forest fragments which are similar in population density but differ in terms of food abundance and proximity to a larger chimpanzee population. Fragmentation usually co-occurs with substantial loss of food resources, as is the case for one of the forest fragments under investigation. However, the other fragment is still comprised of primary forest, presenting a powerful natural experiment through which to test the effect of fragmentation independent of food availability. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that female behavior will be more impacted by food availability and isolation than fragmentation. Alternatively, female chimpanzees may have sufficient behavioral flexibility due to their fluid social system to mitigate negative consequences of fragmentation. By integrating novel and existing ecological and behavioral datasets, this project will test how habitat fragmentation impacts female chimpanzee subgrouping patterns, dispersal and ultimately, reproductive performance. Subgrouping data will be collected through full day focal follow of adult females and monthly nest surveys along line transects. Female dispersal behavior will be assessed through genetic data, which will be generated from non-invasively collected fecal samples. Finally, female reproductive performance will be characterized from two metrics: the adult female-clinging infant ratio and C-peptide values measured through non-invasively collected urine samples.

"This project creates resources and a conceptual schema for developing informed policies that support ethical and responsible research and data practices at academic institutions working with Indigenous Peoples. Although public investment in science has led to numerous societal benefits, research has not always been conducted in ethical and responsible ways, especially in studies involving Indigenous populations. Moreover, efforts to address harmful research practices have tended to be reactive and superficial rather than systematic and collaborative. These issues are addressed by using an innovative Indigenous data governance framework to review institutional norms and practices that promote or inhibit ethical design, outcomes, and approaches across the STEM research landscape and address barriers to developing institutional policies and practices that are responsive to the ethical concerns and priorities of Indigenous Peoples. In so doing it provides research leadership opportunities for early career, women, and Indigenous scholars, and improves institutional guidelines and practices by providing tools to address historical barriers to inclusive and ethical research infrastructures.

This project develops an Indigenous data governance framework by drawing on international norms (i.e., the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples) and relevant data governance standards (i.e., the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance). These sources are used to form a normative matrix that guides project activities. Major goals include: (1) analyzing scholarly literature and institutional policies to develop indicators for assessing ethical research and data practices when working with Indigenous communities; (2) conducting surveys and interviews to identify strategies adopted in similar colonial contexts (e.g., New Zealand, Australia, Canada); and (3) identifying factors that support or inhibit ethical research and data practices with respect to Indigenous communities. A central feature of the project is bi-directional engagement of relevant constituents, rights-holders, and stakeholders in developing indicators, factors, and resources. Indigenous and mainstream experts and Indigenous leaders and community members will help inform the project’s early stages and participate in co-developing guidelines. These activities will advance knowledge of ethical research practices with respect to marginalized communities, outline methods for increasing ethical and responsible research more generally, and promote ethical and responsible research by engaging diverse knowledge systems and communities to increase research data relevance, quality, and reproducibility.

This project was co-funded by the BIO and CISE directorates.

"This project is a research practice partnership that bridges computer science and physical education. The research team and K-5 physical education and coding teachers will co-design and implement learning experiences that incorporate wearable technologies into traditional physical education and coding classes. These experiences will help learners see the broad implications of computer science on athletics and help them see how physical education can advance computational thinking skills. The experiences will also engage students in designing and inventing their own wearables. Finally, the project includes re-envisioning how to assess learning in non-traditional computer science classes. Collectively, the different components of this project help address three important concerns: 1) a shortage of trained computer science teachers, 2) limited time in the school day for additional course content, and 3) the need for computer science education experiences that broaden participation. This project will train approximately 30 educators who can sustain and grow this work beyond the award period. Additionally, the project will reach more than 600 3rd through 5th grade students and examine the impact that this project has on their short-term and long-term interests, perceptions and knowledge of computer science.

This project is informed by prior research on constructionism, embodied cognition, culturally responsive computing and practice-linked learning. These bodies of literature come together to create a generative learning space that sits at the nexus of computational thinking, physical computing and physical education. This integration will be realized through activities that involve testing, critiquing, and designing custom sports wearables. Teachers will design activities that encourage students to 1) collect multimodal data (e.g. indoor location tracking, accelerometers, and bio-physiological sensors) using commercial wearables; 2) use that data to answer questions about their athletic performance; and 3) design low-cost prototypes that enable further exploring and improving their physical performance. Methodologically, this project uses a design based implementation research approach to study the following questions: 1) What are the components of an authentic and generative in-school learning experience that connects computing and athletics? 2) In what ways do these experiences impact short-term and long-term student and teacher perceptions, interest, knowledge and confidence with computing? 3) How do we appropriately re-envision assessments of student learning within these expansive learning environments? These questions will be addressed using a combination of data sources and analytic approaches. Researchers will use repeated measure statistical analyses of periodic questionnaires to quantify changes in perceptions, interest, confidence, and content knowledge. Many of the questionnaire items are drawn from the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) guidelines, and the STEM activation framework. These measures will be complemented by bi-directional artifact analyses of student projects and in-session observations. This bi-directional approach centralizes and synthesizes learning processes and learning products. Finally, the project uses student interviews and logs from a community-wide remote learning platform (EL3) to construct rich long-term learning trajectories for student participants. These data points and analyses will help surface some of the different pathways students might take after engaging in expansive computer science learning opportunities. Moreover, they will elucidate important design principles that integrate learning sciences theory with the practicalities of school. This project is funded by the CS for All program.

"This project will conduct mathematical modeling, analysis and simulation for waterborne infections, which remain a significant public health burden despite tremendous efforts on prevention and intervention programs and a large body of theoretical, experimental, and clinical studies. A particular challenge associated with waterborne infections is to accurately predict the epidemic development and effectively manage the disease outbreaks in populations and environments with strong heterogeneity. The project will develop innovative mathematical models for a deep investigation into the complex, heterogeneous dynamics of waterborne diseases. The project outcome will not only build a solid knowledge base to better understand the transmission and spread of waterborne infections, but also provide useful public health guidelines for disease management and policy-making. Graduate and undergraduate students are involved in the funded research.

The project will establish a new mathematical framework for waterborne infections based on deterministic differential equations. A novel, adaptive cluster modeling approach will be introduced that will integrate and extend the classical Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches. This cluster modeling technique will optimize the balance between the homogeneity and heterogeneity in the quantification of disease dynamics as well as the balance between the individual needs and available resources in the management of disease outbreaks. Using this technique, the project will perform an accurate and efficient study on the dynamics of waterborne infections across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The project will also employ realistic epidemic and demographic data, particularly those related to cholera outbreaks, to validate model predictions and inform model refinement. Successful completion of this project will lead to a potentially transformative progress in the quantitative study of waterborne infections and related disease control strategies.

"With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Chemistry Division and the Genetic Mechanisms program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences are funding Dr. John Chaput from the University of California, Irvine to apply time-resolved X-ray crystallography methods to capture snapshot images as the DNA polymerase enzyme copies one strand of DNA onto another. DNA is the blueprint that directs the molecular basis of life on our planet. However, despite decades of research, there remains an incomplete understanding of how enzymes make new copies of DNA inside cells.  The collection of images is assembled to produce the equivalent of an animated movie showing the precise order of each step in the reaction pathway at the atomic level. The detailed insights into the chemical mechanism of these enzymes leads potentially to the design of new polymerases for applications in biotechnology. In addition, this project includes a significant educational component that is designed to attract and maintain student interest in the chemical and biological sciences. This includes pro-active engagement in a number of university-sponsored programs, including the Minority Science Program, aimed at improving the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in science.  

Time-resolved X-ray crystallography is a powerful method for studying the mechanism of enzymes by capturing intermediates that cannot be observed in the lowest energy states of static protein crystal structures. This project investigates the mechanism of DNA synthesis by collecting time-lapsed images of the Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) and the Klenow-fragment analogue of the Thermus aquaticus (KlenTaq) DNA polymerase. The objectives are to provide details of a tyrosine gating mechanism that prevents frame-shift mutations and a novel push-pull mechanism during elongation. In addition, the study probes an unusual alternative reaction catalyzed by Bst polymerase that uses non-canonical templates (RNA, 2-fluoro-arabino nucleic acid, or alpha-L-threose nucleic acid) for DNA elongation. The time-lapse structures are projected to identify conformational changes as they occur in the enzyme active site. The full collection of snapshot images is to provide unequivocal evidence for the precise order of each intermediate in the reaction pathway and may lead to the discovery of new intermediates not observed in previous DNA polymerase studies. Successful completion of this project is expected to illuminate the chemistry of one of life’s most essential processes—DNA synthesis.

"With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Dr. Chong Fang at Oregon State University to use calculations and sophisticated light measurement methods to guide the design and synthesis of fluorescent probes. Inspired by ""glowing"" biomolecules obtained from jellyfish and reef corals, the creation of new probe molecules that emit fluorescent light over a range of colors has enabled numerous chemical and bio-imaging advances. Although chemical synthesis allows for some level of control over the color and brightness of the fluorescent light emitted by new chemical probes based on these natural molecules, the current bottleneck for solving challenges in imaging applications is the lack of chemically-informed design pathways. This project provides new information about how to make fluorescent probes that are appropriate for imaging applications in biological environments. Training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral scholars is integrated into research activities to reach the project's aims to develop powerful ""molecular movie technologies"" that are key to the tailor-making and use of fluorescent probes. Lessons learned are made part of chemistry and biophysics courses, as well as K-12 student outreach programs, including an annual Juntos Chemistry Overnight Camp for Latinx high school students in Oregon.

The current development of fluorescent probes for imaging across disciplines is largely trial-and-error and lacks molecular insights because fluorescence is intrinsically an ultrafast process. The research in this project led by Dr. Chong Fang at Oregon State University aims to establish a powerful discovery and development platform to achieve rational design principles for redder, larger Stokes-shifted, and brighter fluorescent probes. The real-time tracking of correlated electronic and vibrational motions of protein-derived synthetic chromophores with various functional groups at strategic atomic sites, enriched by the newly proposed ""double-donor-one-acceptor"" strategy, is facilitated by tunable femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS), transient absorption, quantum calculations, and collaborations with chemical biologists. Such a feedback loop effectively bridges generalizable mechanistic insights to biomimetic molecular engineering, which leads to an emerging group of versatile fluorescent probes with diverse donor-acceptor scaffolds. This project at the interface of chemistry, physics, and biology has broad technological applications and science appeal to engage STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) learners at all levels. Strategies include implementing evidence-based instructional practices in physical chemistry, enhancing graduate student communication skills, and developing a Juntos Chemistry Overnight Camp for Latinx high school students across the state of Oregon.

"Biological cells sense and respond to physical forces, which can shape and guide their behavior. Cells can also actively generate forces, to probe and deform materials in their surrounding environment. These dynamic interactions between clusters of cells and their environment are critical to an immense range of activities including early development and cancer progression. In recent years there has been a growing interest to uncover what drives cells to escape from growing clusters, either independently or in collective streams. However, a thorough understanding of the biophysics governing such activity is lacking. To address these issues, a novel computational and experimental framework will be developed to investigate how the interplay between cellular forces, adhesion, and environmental physics drive cells to proliferate, escape, and invade distant regions of the body. The new tools proposed will impact many areas in biology, including normal and abnormal tissue development, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. The innovative mathematical models and methods will advance computing in biology as well as other fields of science such as bioengineering and biotechnology.

Current mathematical models cannot predict why cells invade from a proliferative cluster and migrate either independently or as collective strands, which determines the metastatic risk of invading cells during cancer progression. This problem will be addressed through a novel multi-scale framework that integrates computational models of highly non- linear matrix mechanics, force-mediated cell signaling, and active cell contractility. Such an approach will provide a new understanding of the mechanisms by which matrix properties promote or discourage cell invasion, and why cells tend to either move collectively or act alone. In particular, the critical role of cell-mediated matrix remodeling, long range force transmission, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) will be uncovered. The kinetics of cell invasion requires the formation of protrusions, assembly and dissolution of adhesions, and remodeling of contractile actomyosin fibers. These stochastic processes will be modelled using Kinetic Monte Carlo methods, that will explicitly account for fluctuations in the cell’s response to its environment. Additionally, a novel multi-scale bio-chemo-mechanical model of tissue growth will be developed to predict formation of arbitrarily shaped cell clusters and to quantify how complex patterns of cells emerge from such clusters. This research will lead to a paradigm shift in the mathematical modelling of cell invasion by explicitly including signalling, non-linear matrix mechanics and the two-way recursive dialog between cells and the matrix.

"Changing temperature and rainfall patterns globally will have  major effects on vegetation patterns, in some cases shifting the nature of ecosystems dramatically with consequences for wildlife, and for the services that natural systems provide to humans.  These “critical transitions”  are possible outcomes of environmental shifts in a wide variety of systems, including the savanna and forest transitions that this project will address, in which changes in frequency of fires can be especially important in changing the nature of these key ecosystem types. Building on previous work by the project leaders, this research will develop and apply state-of-the-art mathematical models, in concert with empirical studies, to predict how changing environmental conditions will mediate shifts in the savanna-forest boundary.  This project will also enhance education and training at multiple levels, including the training of a postdoctoral fellow; development of graduate and undergraduate research projects; and data visualization through collaboration with artist and educator Neil Goldberg.

The potential for multiple stable states, respectively forest and savanna, in vegetation systems has been previously demonstrated, combining empirical work with dynamical systems models.  The introduction of spatial effects leads to systems of partial-differential or partial differential-integral equations, including stochastic influences, which of course are more complicated to analyze, but are crucial for predicting the shifts of boundaries.  This project will develop and apply new methodologies drawn from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and will generate novel mathematical results, in particular in terms of fluctuations around the mean-field limit, developing new approaches to these stochastic systems, and applying a  novel landscape-flux approach. A key element will involve the training of a truly interdisciplinary postdoctoral fellow to be fluent both in the mathematical dimensions of the project and the ecological data analysis.

"COVID-19 is a complex disease. While sometimes there are no symptoms, many people suffer life-altering symptoms and side effects that can led to death. Age, gender, racial background, medical history, and lifestyle all can influence the rate of infection and its severity. To invade human cells, the virus attaches to certain macromolecules that are expressed at different levels in different tissues and organs. The local expression of these macromolecules can be influenced by the microbiome, i.e. the bacteria that grow in and around the tissues and organs. This project will analyze how the human microbiome affects the progression of COVID-19. Computational models will be developed that use microbiome compositions to predict outcomes of COVID-19 disease. Such models will provide a better understanding of the basic biology of SARS-COV-2 infection and lead to improved treatment and prevention strategies.  

The main hypothesis is that local microbiomes modulate niche-specific expression of macromolecules critical to COVID-19 development. These include the ACE2 receptor, TMPRSS2 serine protease, unidentified genes associated with SARS-COV-2 invasion and replication, and mediators of the excessive cytokine response. Further, we propose that these differences are associated with differential disease severity. The goal is to develop a statistical model for prediction of disease progression and severity of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 inpatients are enrolled and nasopharyngeal, stool, buccal, urine and blood samples are collected longitudinally. Blood samples are processed for cytokine profiles and a selection of the remaining samples are analyzed by 16S rRNA taxonomic profiling to characterize the local microbiome and by metatranscriptomic sequencing to characterize gene expression profiles and the virus genome sequence. Viral loads are measured. These data will be augmented with metatranscriptomic data from community-collected testing samples which provide only a single nasopharyngeal sample. This dataset will be used to construct models aimed at predicting risk of COVID-19 disease progression and severity. Associations of the multi omic factors with disease severity will be analyzed using multifactorial modeling techniques that leverage the temporal dimension of the data and also incorporate racial and demographic factors. The constructed models will inform risk stratification in screening and increase our understanding of the host-and-microbiome factors impacting the trajectory of COVID-19 disease. Development of the disease model for COVID-19 may also inform the future development of predictive models for other viral infections.

"Digital data are being generated at increasingly overwhelming rates both economically and for the environment, with data storage material and energy usages close to reaching the physical limits of what current technologies can provide. For over two decades DNA has been considered with only limited enthusiasm as a potential next generation medium for data storage, despite holding pronounced advantages of high density, stability, and low energy requirements. This is because executing the core operations of a data storage system including write, access, read, and protect using DNA currently requires multiple complex steps carried out in succession. Furthermore, they often require specialized processing and purification in between each operational step. This leads to practical barriers in speed, cost, scalability, and reusability. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that an interdisciplinary collaboration can completely reimagine and reengineer these core operations to be continuous, highly practical, and economically viable through creative integration of knowledge and technologies from disparate disciplines. Specifically, molecular biology techniques from the Biological Sciences will be informed and designed by models and simulations derived from the discipline of Computer Science and Engineering, while these biological components will be physically controlled and interfaced with nanomaterials developed with expertise in Materials Science and Nanoscience. This hybrid information storage system engineered from DNA directly interfaced with novel nanofibrillar substrates, will leverage dynamic processing by biomolecular manipulations, and will unlock direct and rapid readout of information with semiconductor-based nanopore technology. Biomolecular-based computational modeling will inform all aspects of both the design of the system and its operation, from molecular to systems level scales. The interdisciplinary nature of this project will also provide strong opportunities to advance education and diversity in the Science-Technology-Engineering-Math (STEM) workforce through several avenues. This interdisciplinary research provides opportunities for undergraduate researchers to experience directly working with peers and PhD students from very different disciplines on common problems. Undergraduate course modules will be created that bridge synthetic biology, nanoscience, materials science, computer science and engineering that present applied interdisciplinary examples including DNA storage as case studies. Hands-on kits will also be developed to facilitate in-person and virtual activities administered through partnerships with organizations that reach and support underrepresented grade-school students in STEM. 

This project aims to transform DNA storage systems from batch to continuous architectures. Each Aim addresses a unit process (WRITE, ACCESS, READ, PROTECT). WRITE: Rapid, scalable, and cheap DNA synthesis will be engineered by a combination of tree algorithms and enzyme-driven DNA assembly. ACCESS: Continuous and reusable access of information and files will be achieved by immobilization of a DNA database on dendritic colloidal particles with easily accessible high surface areas. This novel scaffold allows a transcription-based file access system previously developed by the team to rapidly extract information in the form of transcribed RNA through simple laminar flow through the DNA database. READ: RNA generated by the ACCESS technology will be directly read by nanopore sequencing, and fundamental experimental and machine learning studies will be engaged to inform the encoding algorithms of DNA databases and to optimize real-time base-calling. PROTECT: The unique physical and thermodynamic attributes of DNA and of these first three hybrid unit processes will be exploited to encrypt and obfuscate information. While fundamental thermodynamic findings, computational models, and physical technologies generated in each aim have strong and specific benefits in mutually informing the other aims, these unit processes will further be integrated together by two ongoing explicit Umbrella Tasks. End-to-end microfluidic devices storing protected data will be engineered by integrating all unit processes, informed by systems-level modeling to identify unit processes that are the bottlenecks for speed, cost, robustness, and longevity. This work will also generate important fundamental knowledge and models that will be generalizable to other types of biomolecular-based information storage systems as well as applicable to problems in each distinct discipline regarding DNA assembly and interaction specificity, nanoparticle engineering, and nucleic acid sequencing.

"Living cells are equipped with highly versatile built-in toolkits of DNA, RNA, and proteins for molecular communication, computing, storage, and sensing/actuation in response to environmental stimuli. Synthetic biology has been successful in developing engineered cells by harnessing the same biological toolkits with enhanced natural functions or new human-defined functions. These engineered cells can potentially serve as a biological frontend layer that naturally interfaces with the environment and acts as biosensors/actuators, molecular computing platforms, and molecular memory to provide revolutionary solutions for many global challenges such as environmental monitoring, and healthcare. In parallel, with decades of technological advances, semiconductor technologies, e.g., Complementary-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits (ICs), are being widely employed as a semiconductor backend layer to achieve various integration, communication, and computation capabilities. This project investigates the development of a hybrid programmable nano-bioelectronic system as a first proof-of-concept demonstration that harnesses both the exquisite synthetic functionalities of engineered bacteria as the ""biological frontend"" and the full functionalities of the ultra-low-power CMOS integrated circuit chips as the ""semiconductor backend."" The target application of such a system includes in-field biological sensor for environment monitoring. The project has potentials for long-term broader impacts on basic science, education, and technology. It brings expertise from synthetic biology, hybrid bioelectronics, integrated circuits/packaging, information theory, and computing. The project directly addresses three research themes of the solicitation: Theme-1, biomolecular memory and computation; Theme 2, interface of biology and semiconductors; Theme-4, hybrid semiconductor-biological microelectronic systems. It seeks to foster collaborations between industry and academia and hence facilitates technology transfer. The team of investigators will train graduate and undergraduate students at Georgia Tech and MIT, including minority and under-represented students. The project will also emphasize K-12 outreach to promote education of local minority high school students. In particular, the research team will recruit high school teacher interns to enhance their curricula and organize lab tours for K-12 students. The research results will be disseminated through high-impact journals, premier conferences, websites, and social media, and will be integrated into multiple related courses at Georgia Tech and MIT.

The project aims to advance the science in multiple fronts and develop an integrated hybrid programmable nano-bioelectronic system. In such a system, a variety of bacteria strains are engineered as sensing, storage, and computation biological frontends to (1) perform wide-spectrum chemical sensing, e.g., heavy metal detections for environmental monitoring, (2) provide in-bacteria DNA-based storage of analog/digital information, (3) execute molecular computation via stochastic computing and encode the signal for the DNA storage, and (4) support ""variable gain"" reprogramming of bacteria sensors by external optical and electrical stimuli. As the integrated semiconductor electronics backend, CMOS IC chips with on-chip pixelated massively paralleled arrays will be developed to provide two-way multi-modal interfaces with the bacteria frontends, i.e., for reading stored sensory information from the bacteria and writing control signals to reprogram the bacteria sensors. The bacteria strains and CMOS ICs will be integrated together in 3D-printed microfluidics structures and packages with separate chambers. The proposed components and systems will be demonstrated through in vitro experiments using the resources at Georgia Tech and MIT.

"Mineral weathering replenishes the supply of inorganic nutrients that sustains terrestrial life on Earth. The soil microbiome, including fungal communities, contributes to weathering by disrupting, dissolving, and extracting nutrients from mineral grains. Fungi seek out nutrients and water sources by spreading networks of exploratory hyphae across a soil landscape. However, identifying the mechanisms used by fungi to transform minerals to extract rock-derived nutrients remains challenging, especially in natural soils that span different climates, rock types, and ecosystems. The goal of the research is to understand how fungi interact with abiotic environments to initiate mineral weathering and form soil in Earth’s critical zone. This project will utilize recent advances in high resolution microscopy and mass spectrometry to examine fungi interacting with mineral surfaces at micro-to nano-scale resolutions. The results will demonstrate how new technologies can promote the progress of the earth and environmental sciences in combination with an Integrated Critical Zone Model. The project findings will bring economic and societal benefits with respect to soil preservation, agricultural activity, and bio-engineering given the ubiquitous nature of soil fungi in the environment. This research will be integrated with the educational goal to diversify, recruit, and retain community college students in the (geo)sciences academic pipeline by implementing: Soils & Outreach for Integrated Learning & Self-Efficacy (SOILS) Bridge. The bridge program will enhance academic and social resources for incoming college students through tiered mentoring, training in the field and lab, and K-12 outreach. 

This work will probe into fungal-mineral interactions across spatial scales to answer unresolved questions related to fungal impact on mineral transformations and contributions to nutrient cycling. The research objectives are to: 1) Assess weathering of natural soils and incipient transformation of mineral substrates buried in mesh bags across landscapes that span bioclimatic (desert to coastal rainforest) and topographic (summit to drainage) gradients, 2) Differentiate weathering agents and the initial stages of fungal-driven weathering in field systems using microscopy, mass spectrometry, and elemental analyses of deployed minerals, and 3) Quantify mass transfer rates of mineral elements normalized to mineral-fungi contact areas determined from field-deployed mineral samples and subsequently upscaled using soil process models.  The study will provide unprecedented insight into how fungi respond to climate, topography, and nutrient availability and will offer mechanistic insights into processes that upregulate weathering in natural soils.

"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a gas produced by microbes in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, and, like other greenhouse gases, it contributes to global warming. Furthermore, N2O can destroy ozone, a gas responsible for protecting the earth from dangerous ultraviolet radiation. In the ocean, N2O production is largely controlled by the amount of available dissolved oxygen, with more N2O being produced under low oxygen concentrations; however, when no oxygen is available, a scenario referred to as anoxia, microbes in the ocean switch from producing N2O to consuming N2O. In recent years, it has become evident that zones of low oxygen are expanding in some areas of the oceans, and this has raised concern that more N2O will be produced. If this occurs, more N2O will be emitted to the atmosphere, and will lead to further global warming and ozone destruction. Because of this, research has largely focused on understanding how much N2O is produced in the ocean under low oxygen conditions. If, however, anoxic zones also increase in size, this could act to balance out, at least to some degree, the predicted increase in N2O production caused by the expansion of zones where oxygen is present but in low concentrations. This study aims to simultaneously measure N2O production and consumption, in both low oxygen and anoxic zones and identify the microbes responsible for N2O production and consumption. Our results will: 1) lead to a much better understanding of how N2O consumption in anoxic zones could help to balance out an increase in N2O production if low oxygen zones in the ocean continue to expand, 2) help to inform models aimed at predicting oceanic N2O production and emissions to the atmosphere under future ocean conditions, and 3) allow us to better understand the microbes involved in N2O production and consumption. Our study will support a postdoc and undergraduate students who will work at the interface of marine chemistry and community genomics. The PIs plan to specifically consider applications from underrepresented minorities and students at institutions with limited opportunities. The PIs also plan a number of other educational/outreach programs ranging from teacher-training workshops, teacher internships, and academic and public lecture series. 


The oceanic production of the potent greenhouse and ozone destroying gas nitrous oxide (N2O) increases as dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations transition from oxic to hypoxic. Marine DO concentrations have decreased globally with climate change and oceanic hypoxic zones have expanded and predicted to continue expanding. This increase is cause for concern that N2O production in the ocean will increase in the future which would lead to higher emissions to the atmosphere. As a result, much research has focused on quantifying the oxygen thresholds that correspond to large increases in N2O production. In contrast, relatively few studies have aimed to quantify the capacity for net N2O consumption, resulting from microbial N2O reduction to N2 under anoxic conditions, to buffer against predicted N2O production increases if anoxic zones expand in conjunction with hypoxic zones. To this end, this study aims to simultaneously quantify N2O production and consumption from oxic-hypoxic-anoxic water column zones, in order to determine the potential for N2O consumption to counteract predicted increases in N2O production. Our field work be conducted in Saanich Inlet, a British Columbian fjord which is an ideal natural laboratory for our study, as it is characterized by a well-established oxycline and anoxic zone. Specifically, we aim to 1) measure bulk N2O concentrations, and, using 15N tracer techniques, quantify N2O production and consumption rates as DO concentrations decrease from oxic to anoxic conditions, 2) quantify the magnitude by which N2O consumption in the anoxic zone balances increased N2O production in the overlying hypoxic region, and 3) definitively link observed N2O production and consumption rates to the microorganisms mediating this process, focusing specifically on distinguishing N2O consumption via denitrifier (NO3- to N2) versus non-denitrifier (N2O to N2 only) taxa. Ultimately, our results will provide quantitative information on N2O consumption rates over fluctuating ocean conditions, thereby helping constrain models of oxygen effects on net N2O production and ocean-to-atmosphere greenhouse gas fluxes. Furthermore, this work will identify the taxonomic breadth of microbes capable of N2O reduction and their linkage to actual N2O reduction rates, thereby providing a quantitative understanding of whether or not the detection of specific bio-signatures is predictive of marine N2O dynamics.

It attracts a diverse group of scientists, including women, underrepresented minority groups, and persons with disabilities, from across the nation and trains future leaders at all academic and professional levels to address critical societal challenges. This MRSEC’s integrated activities—including novel materials research, partnerships with industry and national laboratories, entrepreneurial innovation, career development, and mentorship—are enabling a transformative long-term impact on fundamental science, advanced applications, and workforce development. 

Technical Abstract: The UCI MRSEC combines an experimental, computational, and theoretical framework pursuing atomic- and molecular-level design and control of structure and dynamic response through two Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs). IRG 1 investigates the atomic-level structure, chemistry, thermodynamics, and kinetics of interfaces in an emerging class of Complex Concentrated Materials (CCMs) that exhibit exceptional properties such as high strength, ultra-low thermal conductivity, and extremely large dielectric constants. Understanding their structure-property relationships guides design and processing of next-generation structural and functional materials. IRG 2 investigates dissipative self-assembly strategies to understand fundamental charge-matter interactions, with the goal to produce supramolecular “living” materials. Development of conductive active materials, where assembly is fueled by chemical, electrical, and other stimuli, provides the intellectual framework for a new class of living electronic materials for bio-interfaces and biological computing. The research team leverages state-of-the-art electron microscopy facilities within the Irvine Materials Research Institute and pursues instrumentation innovations to characterize atomic-scale structure and dynamic properties. Multifaceted education, outreach, and collaborations with industry, national laboratories, and nonprofit organizations allow this MRSEC to achieve significant, long-term impact with the targeted scientific advances. This impact includes technological innovation, workforce development, and boosting of the regional and national economy. Synergistic activities provide holistic training of diverse junior scientists at all stages, from K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students to postdoctoral scholars and untenured faculty, further fostering inclusive excellence in STEM.

"The big data revolution has turned statistics and machine learning into highly active and fast-pace research areas that have seen great progress over the last few decades.  However  uncertainly quantification with big data and complex models remains a challenge in the field.   In theory, Bayesian statistics solves -- elegantly and straightforwardly -- the uncertainty quantification problem. There is therefore a need for ideas and methods for constructing useful and computationally scalable Bayesian procedures. This research project contributes towards that goal. The developed methodology can improve decision making in areas such as autonomous driving, medical diagnostics, bail decision, credit worthiness, criminal sentencing, to list a few. This research will also include training for graduate students. 


This project contributes to the development of theoretically sound, and computationally scalable Bayesian methodologies for the recovery of high-dimensional parameters. Toward that goal, the PI will develop a novel and widely applicable quasi-Bayesian (semi-parametric) framework for learning high-dimensional parameters.  The project  will also contribute to the development of Bayesian asymptotic theory with the analysis of high-dimensional, non-identifiable models.  Several high-profile models (e.g. neural network models)  widely  used in the applications are non-identifiable.  By applying the new framework to canonical correlation analysis, this project will also contribute to the development of flexible Bayesian solutions for high-dimensional sparse canonical correlation analysis,  with wide applicability in bio-medical research. This research project will also contribute to the computational aspects of high-dimensional Bayesian statistics with the development of several novel MCMC and VA algorithms. Finally, this research project will also contribute more broadly to statistics and machine learning with the development of Bayesian generative adversarial networks (GAN).

"The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Division of Chemistry funds Professor Nathan Boland at Whitman College. Professor Boland and his students study chemical reactions that affect the availability of metal ions in living organisms. Metal ions can be essential nutrients or toxic contaminants depending on identity and concentration. The chemical form of a metal ion affects how readily the metal is absorbed into an organism. Researchers use chelating resins, which are synthetic compounds that also absorb metal ions, to estimate bioavailability in particular natural waters. This project studies the chemical reactions where chelating resins capture metal ions bound by different organic molecules. The goal of this project is to better understand these reactions and build better predictive tools. The project provides a unique opportunity for undergraduate students to participate as researchers, collaborators, and co-authors of presentations and papers.  The project will immerse Whitman undergraduate students in cutting-edge environmental chemistry research. The project will contribute to a growing network of research-active faculty at Whitman with interests in environmental chemistry and transition metal chemistry. This project will enhance Dr. Boland's ability to integrate teaching and research by informing his courses with current and relevant issues in the field. Dr. Boland is committed to continued involvement with Whitman-based science outreach and educational activities engaging local elementary and middle school students and teachers.

Multidentate ligand exchange reactions are important in controlling transition metal ion speciation and biouptake. However, there is limited mechanistic understanding of how reaction pathways affect reaction kinetics. The technique of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) was designed to mimic bio-uptake and is a useful tool for evaluating metal ion bioavailability in situ. The project uses the adjunctive-semijunctive-disjunctive framework for classifying multidentate ligand exchange reactions to evaluate common assumptions in both DGT and biouptake models. Initial rates of nickel uptake into a suite of DGT chelating resin layers are quantified under varied reaction conditions. Results are used to evaluate new combined kinetic-mass transfer models for each multidentate ligand exchange pathway. Additionally, the project evaluates the effect of low molecular weight organic acids (e.g. oxalate) and the common constituent ion calcium on rates and pathways of metal ion uptake.

"The NSF Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology (CSN) seeks to understand how nanoparticles, particles that are at least 10,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair, transform and interact in and with water and biological systems. Nanoparticles can vary in elemental composition, structure, and properties, which makes them useful for industries ranging from electronics, to batteries, to cosmetics. As nanoparticle use becomes more widespread, however, they are appearing in the environment.  When nanoparticles are incorporated into biological systems they may induce unusual behavior that is beneficial or harmful, but is as of yet poorly understood. For instance, due to their small size, some nanoparticles can easily pass through some cell membranes. With very high surface area to volume ratios, nanoparticles can also be highly reactive, which may trigger chemical changes in the environment or to the nanoparticle itself. The CSN applies a ""make, measure, model"" strategy to develop new functional nanomaterials with increased sustainability and reduced biological impact. Expertise with synthetic methods, in situ analytical techniques, and computational methods is leveraged to understand, predict, and control nanoparticle properties and their chemical interactions with the environment and biological systems. The CSN addresses key knowledge gaps in the areas of nanoparticle properties which will result in better prediction of specific nanoparticle chemical properties and their biological interactions. This will ultimately serve the national interest by allowing for the design of more effective and more benign nanoparticles for many applications. Some of the systems the CSN investigates include: transition metal oxides and phosphates and two-dimensional quantum materials; gold, diamond and silicon based nanoparticles with defined organic and inorganic surface coatings; and as well as emerging nanoparticle compositions that exhibit fundamental new science and utility, such as those based on polymeric carbon dots, and nanovacancies in nanodiamond. This integrated, multi-institutional, and collaborative team involves researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Minnesota, Boston University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, Augsburg University, University of California-Riverside, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, University of Iowa, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and the Connecticut Agricultural Experimental Station. The Center has a strong innovation component that involves the translation of research results into intellectual property, as well as other collaborations with several industrial partners. The CSN has an inclusive and transparent management approach that enables a positive Center climate and facilitates the integration of student learning across Center activities. Students broaden and deepen their technical expertise and grant writing through student laboratory exchanges and seed grant opportunities. The CSN places special emphasis on communication training. Example mechanisms to develop student communication skills are the popular Sustainable Nano Blog, http://sustainable-nano.com/, and the Spanish language-based Nano Sostenible Blog, http://nano-sostenible.com/. These are key components of the Center's informal science communication efforts, and students have ample opportunity to participate in these educational websites. Webinars on fostering technical innovation, internship opportunities, and opportunities to serve on the advisory board are mechanisms through which students further develop their professional skill sets. The CSN is committed to broadening participation efforts and incorporates summer research experiences for undergraduates and veterans, and relationships with minority-serving institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions, and community colleges as ways to address inclusivity. The strong focus on the CSN climate helps to ensure all participants feel welcomed, valued, and supported. Partnerships with the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey and Rio Piedras, the University of Texas Rio Grand Valley, Tuskegee University, and Georgia State University help to ensure that a diverse group of students can participate in the CSN where they develop not only the skills mentioned above, but also an understanding of the need to approach questions in chemistry with an awareness of sustainability, inclusivity, and interdisciplinarity. The CSN experience will prepare participants to make unique future contributions as members of the chemical workforce. 

The CSN organizes their goals along four focus areas. One area focuses on establishing nanoparticle structure–function relationships. Chemical composition, size, shape, and organic or inorganic surface modifications are investigated with a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Transition metal oxides, nanoparticles comprised of earth-abundant elements, and nanoparticles that demonstrate novel properties or new utility are focal points. A second area of investigation centers on understanding nanoparticle transformations that occur in the environment and in biological media. Chemical changes in the nanoparticle core, the roles of inorganic and organic ions to impact nanoparticle stability, and surface structure are some of the areas explored. The third CSN thrust area explores nanoparticle coatings, referred to as coronas, formed by their exposure to the environment or biological systems at aqueous interfaces as a function of time. Analytical and computational approaches are developed to characterize and model the chemical nature and formation mechanisms of nanoparticle coronas. The fourth area is a chemistry-focused investigation of the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles and their interactions with biological systems. Nanoparticles with well-defined composition, structure, and surface chemistry are used to correlate, better understand, and predict nanoparticle physicochemical properties, spatial and temporal interactions at biological surfaces, and the direct or indirect effects on molecular interactions in cells and organisms. The CSN enriches the chemistry community by providing new tools for characterizing chemical processes at nanoparticle surfaces and by developing experimentally validated computational methods to predict the molecular-level behavior of complex materials in aqueous media. CSN participants are engaged in activities aimed at facilitating the creation and dissemination of knowledge, enhancing innovation and translation of research products and outcomes to the commercial sector, and providing unique education and training opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds.

"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the lack of human cell culture models available for studying this virus, and the devastating consequences of this shortcoming as it relates to human health and disease. The proposed project, known as “CLEARED” for Culture of Living-biopsies for Emerging Airway-pathogens and REspiratory Disease, combines cutting-edge technologies in 3D-printing, soft tissue engineering, artificial-intelligence-enhanced imaging, human lung biology, and virology to understand the spread of COVID-19 in lungs. This will increase the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 biology and transmission. The researchers have developed the technology to grow portions of lung into living 3D-printed tissue structures that resembles the architecture found in the lung in a liquid-like-solid matrix. Thus, this system more closely resemble the environment in living humans versus standard cell culture. After infecting these samples with SARS-CoV-2 virus, advanced imaging of these “living biopsies” will be used to study virus spread from cell to cell, and the efficacy of therapeutic treatments. Outcomes of the proposed research include: (i) Validating a standard model system using human lung biopsies and known diagnostics in response to SARS-CoV-OC43 infection; (ii) Determining how the disease develops and spreads in biopsies infected with different human and bat coronavirus strains. It is expected that this system will allow scientists to better understand virus transmission and prevention. This project also supports the training of three graduate students, leading to an increase in future workers to drive the bioeconomy.

The proposing team hypothesizes that controlled perfusion of SARS-CoV-2 in 3D culture models of human respiratory microtissue explants can recapitulate early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. To test this hypothesis, PIs will establish a 3D model of viral infection using living microtissue explants of human bronchus and peripheral lung, quantify the early responses to viral infection using a novel 3D tissue culture platform, and determine the spatiotemporal pathogenesis of different human and bat coronaviruses strains. Preliminary data show that SARS-CoV-2 indeed infects the micro-tissues of bronchus and peripheral lung. This is a transdisciplinary team of investigators from Astronomy, Chemistry, Medicine, Engineering, Virology and lung biology.  The proposed work is organized by two tasks. Task 1 will validate a standard model system using human lung biopsies and known host-response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Readouts will include viral titer, cytokine production and spatiotemporal imaging of viral replication in response to coronavirus infection. Task 2 will determine the spatiotemporal pathogenesis of human lung biopsies infected with different human coronavirus strains (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV-2) and one bat strain (btCoV-HKU3). The heterogenous nature of biopsies will alter the viral titer and cytokine production of biopsies compared to measurements in cell lines, and will provide superior information about progression and virus spread through tissues than standard cell culture technology. This RAPID award is made by the Physiological and Structural Systems Cluster in the BIO Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

"The United States works to ensure that the research it sponsors is conducted ethically by requiring oversight of certain kinds of research, such as that involving humans or animals. However, do-it-yourself (DIY) scientific research conducted by individuals in their homes, garages, or community labs often is not subject to these research ethics regulations. The ethical challenges that participants in DIY communities may encounter are particularly salient in the COVID-19 pandemic, which has spurred an international group of DIY researchers to come together in pursuit of diagnostics and treatments. Because DIYers participating in these efforts are primarily communicating via publicly accessible online outlets, the pandemic offers an excellent opportunity to learn more about ethical issues in DIY research in a concentrated and accelerated setting. The project aims to assess how unregulated DIY research communities negotiate ethical challenges during an ongoing pandemic. It will lead to a better understanding of how DIY scientists identify, approach, and resolve ethical issues in their work in crises, and to practical understanding of what barriers or facilitators of ethical research exist in unregulated domains. 

Through online observations and interviews, this project examines how participants in open-source COVID-19 projects negotiate three central ethical issues: biosafety and harm, validation and replication, and authorship and credit. Phase 1 consists of analyzing digital communications amongst project members on an international DIY science platform called Just One Giant Lab (JOGL), where thousands of individuals are collaborating on open-source COVID-19 projects. Phase 2 involves conducting follow-up interviews with approximately 40 JOGL participants to probe participants’ ethics-related comments, how ethical challenges were resolved or were unable to be resolved, and whether there was agreement with and satisfaction about eventual outcomes. The interviews will explore participants’ views regarding barriers to—and facilitators of—unregulated ethical research, and what tools they would have found helpful in that context. This research will significantly advance our understanding of how and where ethical issues arise in unregulated research during times of crisis, and how participants in open science communities negotiate these challenges. This project will result in recommendations for developing better tools and approaches to help ensure the ethical conduct of DIY research, and will assist regulators and policymakers with the development of more informed approaches to ethics in unregulated research.

"This interdisciplinary team of three investigators will integrate mathematical modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments to investigate key fundamental issues surrounding the mechanosensory roles of primary cilia. Primary cilia are solitary (one per cell), immotile, antenna-like microtubule-based organelles extending from the surface of nearly every mammalian cell. Mechanical stimuli (such as blood flow) cause deflection of the primary cilium, initiating downstream signaling cascades to the rest of the cell. Defects in primary cilia have been associated with atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, and cancer. Yet the biochemical signaling pathways from primary cilia bending to cellular responses remain a complex and unsolved problem that will be addressed by the three PIs. Results from the proposed research will further our understanding of subcellular mechanosensing of primary cilia, and will lay the foundation for designing therapeutic strategies to treat various human diseases due to defected primary cilia. The PIs will engage both undergraduate and graduate students to conduct interdisciplinary research, and results from the proposed research can provide new approaches in mathematical biology, biophysics, biomedical engineering and medicine. The methods and techniques to be developed in this project will go beyond the context of primary cilia and extend to other problems featuring mechanically induced cellular functions, for example, in the regulation of vascular tone. 

Long speculated to trigger intracellular calcium release as a second messenger for subsequent cellular biochemical signaling and responses (such as change in patterns of cytoskeleton or altered ion and solvent transport), recent experiments using genetically-coded calcium indicators refuted the calcium-responsiveness of primary cilia for a range of cells. Thus it is imperative to establish fundamental understanding of the role of primary cilia in subcellular mechanosensing. One main challenge to identify the pathway(s) from cilium bending to subsequent bio-chemical signaling is to isolate primary cilium contribution from the rest of the cell responding directly to the same mechanical stimuli. By using an optical trap, PI Resnick is able to bend a single primary cilium without exerting force on the rest of the cell, thus providing a great opportunity for insight to the missing pathways. Combining this experimental technique with mathematical modeling (PI Young) and numerical simulations (PI Peng), the team aims to (1) characterize the mechanical properties of the primary cilium, (2) qualify the coupling between cilium and cytoskeleton, and (3) identify the time scales and characteristics of signaling activation to quantify ciliary-mediated flow sensing. Results from these three aims will advance the mathematical modeling of the primary cilium and how it couples to the intracellular signaling pathways.

"This project targets the design of heterogeneous catalysts for the conversion of biomass to chemicals and fuels. The researchers will study catalyst structure and performance aspects related to catalyst stability, activity, and product selectivity.  The project will support transition to a clean-energy economy by improving the design of catalysts for manufacturing fuels and chemicals from bio-renewable feedstocks rather than fossil sources. The project will involve an educational outreach component that will seek to increase participation of women and underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.

Specifically, the project will investigate the synthesis-structure-reactivity of aminosilanes immobilized on heterogeneous silica supports for the isomerization of glucose to fructose. A series of heterogeneous catalysts containing different aminosilane designs will be tested to determine how the structure of the aminosilane can be modified to increase catalyst stability. Identifying a stable aminosilane structure will have broad implications for catalytic materials for all liquid-phase chemistry. Further, the work will examine how the reaction selectivity can be increased through modifying the reaction conditions, including the concentration of glucose. The complex reaction mixtures will be analyzed using advanced mass spectrometry techniques to determine how glucose concentration impacts the species formed. Finally, spectroscopy techniques including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) will be used to investigate amine-silanol interactions. These amine-silanol interactions have been implicated in reducing the activity of aminosilica materials. The spectroscopy will provide insights on how the structure of the aminosilane impacts amine-silanol interactions. The impact of the project can be substantial since it has the potential to provide new methods to create heterogeneous catalysts for aqueous phase reactions. The project involves a  diverse team of students that will be trained in advanced catalytic material synthesis, characterization, and testing. More broadly, the project will broaden participation from underrepresented groups in STEM programs through interfacing with several existing programs at Ohio State University to demonstrate a classroom module to elementary school children to inspire future generations to pursue education in STEM-related fields.

"This research will address prediction and control of fracture in concrete, with implications in other heterogenous materials such as rocks, fiber composites, ceramics, sea ice, rigid foams, shale, various bio-, biomimetic and printed architectured materials. Concrete fracture is a serious safety concern generally, and particularly during earthquakes. Fracture is always accompanied by cracking which, in the long term, leads to environmental degradation as well. Realistic fracture predictions based on standardized laboratory tests and computer simulations is therefore critical to strong and durable civil infrastructure. Recent research reveals that crack tips in quasibrittle materials are surrounded by a wide zone of visually undetectable microcracking damage, which controls crack growth yet is very sensitive to stresses that are parallel to the cracks. The effects of these crack-parallel stresses are currently unknown. This research will devise a new type of laboratory test, which can measure the changes of energy required for fracture growth at various crack-parallel stress levels. Testing will be conducted to better understand the effect of crack-parallel stresses on normal and high-strength concretes as well as fiber-reinforced concretes, and the results will be used to formulate a new mathematical model for quasibrittle fracture. 

The crack-parallel stress effects have gone unnoticed because they do not appear in the currently standardized fracture tests and are not thermodynamic variables in existing linear elastic fracture mechanics and cohesive crack models. The key idea of this research is a modification of the notched three-point bend test with four crucial features: 1) plastic support pads at notch mouth introduce constant notch-parallel compression; 2) the end supports installed with gaps engage only when the pads are yielding; 3) the test setup switches from one statically determinate configuration to another, allowing unambiguous interpretation; and 4) the size effect method, most effective for fracture energy testing, is made possible. A finite element crack band model with a tensorial damage softening law will be developed and calibrated by optimal fitting of the test results. Finally, a multiscale model that incorporates mesoscale mechanisms of frictional slip, microcrack opening, interlock and splitting causing the crack-parallel stress effects will be devised. The results are expected to transform fracture mechanics of quasibrittle materials.

"This research will investigate a new self-healing concrete enriched with bioinspired multifunctional microbial polymeric fibers to improve durability and resilience of civil infrastructure. Concrete, the most commonly used manmade material on earth, suffers from long-term durability issues due to formation of cracks under sustained loading and in harsh operating environments. Using nature-inspired concepts of self-healing and microbial calcium carbonate precipitation (MCCP) coupled with principles of fracture mechanics, this project will investigate science-based design strategies for a new bioinspired fiber reinforced concrete composite (BioFRC). BioFRC can intelligently and autonomously heal its cracks at early stages and prevent formation of major defects, thereby increasing durability of concrete structures. The research outcomes will be integrated with diverse educational and outreach activities on sustainable bio-engineered solutions for civil infrastructure. K-12, undergraduate, graduate and underrepresented students will be engaged in research workshops on self-healing infrastructure and interdisciplinary teaching modules, and lectures will be developed during the course of this project.

The specific goal of the research is to discover process-structure-property relationships for autonomic microbial self-healing concrete. The research will investigate (1) damage control mechanisms to limit crack growth, (2) autonomic self-activation near damage zones for damage-responsive healing activation, and (3) effective materials to heal the damage. By coupling principles from polymer/fiber engineering, fracture mechanics and microbiology, and through integrated experimental and numerical work, fundamental understanding of two crucial mechanisms and their interactions will be achieved: harmonizing fracture processes, and balancing MCCP with crack volume creation. The research activities and methodologies will pursue three specific objectives: (i) to understand mechanical, bridging, and breaking mechanism and morphology of microbial polymeric fibers, (ii) to understand microbial polymeric fibers’ performance and bacterial survivability before occurrence of cracks, and MCCP activation/kinetics after occurrence of cracks in BioFRC, and (iii) to test the robustness of the research approach and potential durability and resilience enhancements in concrete.

"All aspects of society have been upended by COVID-19. While most research has understandably focused on clinical applications, how the ancestors of SARS-CoV2 survive and circulate in nature is vital to both prevent future epidemics and help health professionals develop therapeutic treatments. Because some bat species are natural carriers of many coronaviruses, including the closest known relatives of SARS-CoV-2, the team supported by this award will identify consistent differences between bats and other mammals likely involved in moderating infection by regulating virus entry and mounting an effective immune response. This project will address how bats escape illness despite carrying a wide range of viruses. As part of this work, the research team will develop educational displays related to the bat immunology for public display at the Museum of Texas Tech. Results for the study will also be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, and posted to shared data repositories.

Researchers supported by this award hypothesize there are consistent differences in the genes involved in the immune response pathways of bats compared to other mammals, such that: a) bats show disproportionate numbers of unique genomic adaptations; b) there is higher expression of immune system genes in bats than in comparable mouse and human tissues, and c) expression of genes involved in coronavirus cell entry in bats differs in RNA profile, limiting the extent pathogenesis when compared to humans and mice. To test these hypotheses, the team will analyze genome structure across diverse bats species, and differential expression analysis of different tissues, in the context of viral tropism and immune response. Resulting data will inform researchers and clinicians as they anticipate and treat these respiratory syndromes.

"Anthropogenic factors, including climate change, are increasing the prevalence of low-oxygen zones in oceans around the world (i.e., ocean deoxygenation), and this is especially true in the northern Gulf of Mexico where large seasonal oxygen minimum zones are common. Deoxygenation of coastal waters has serious implications for marine life, including the economically and ecologically important fish species endemic to these regions. It is hypothesized that the long-term survival of species subjected to this type of environmental change depend in part on their ability to acclimate by altering their physiology, a concept known as phenotypic plasticity. This proposal will use a combination of molecular biology, biochemistry, and whole-animal physiology to explore the ability of an economically important fish species, the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), to enhance respiratory oxygen uptake following exposure to prolonged periods of reduced oxygen availability. Results of this work will be incorporated into public education initiatives targeting K-12 students. The goal of these efforts will be to increase the scientific literacy of youth and the general public with an emphasis on understanding the core principles of ocean health, climate change, and the importance of healthy oceans and fish populations for coastal communities. In addition, mentored research training in integrative physiology will be provided for several undergraduate and graduate students and a post-doctoral fellow. 

The primary objective of this work is to explore the physiological mechanisms and ecological significance of respiratory plasticity in a representative marine fish, the red drum, exposed to prolonged environmental hypoxia. These exposures will occur above the critical oxygen threshold for the species, and the capacity of red drum to maximize aerobic scope, which would increase the capacity for ecologically important activities, will be assessed. This work integrates across multiple levels of organization by first exploring plasticity in the red blood cells, heart and red muscle using gene expression and biochemistry, after which whole-animal performance will be measured. The project addresses the following hypotheses related to hypoxia exposure: 1) fish will exhibit an altered pattern of hemoglobin expression coincident with elevated red blood cell and plasma accessible carbonic anhydrase that will work cooperatively to enhance oxygen offloading in the heart and muscle; 2) the heart and muscle will exhibit reduced mitochondrial proton leak, thereby generating more energy per unit oxygen; 3) acclimation will result in increased swimming performance and aerobic scope at the organismal level; 4) red drum exposed to reduced oxygen levels at early life stages will exhibit rigid phenotypic plasticity that results in altered phenotypes later in life. This comprehensive evaluation will provide invaluable insight into the ability of marine fishes to offset the deleterious effects of ocean deoxygenation on respiratory performance. These activities will also contribute to graduate and undergraduate student and post-doctoral training, and results will be integrated into public education initiatives focused on implications of climate change and ocean deoxygenation on marine life.

"Conversion of lignin and cellulose from trees and plants into valuable products could reduce our reliance on non-renewable feedstocks such as petroleum and natural gas. Pseudomonas are species of soil bacteria with robust and varied metabolisms. As a result, they can produce a variety of potentially important molecules. This project will develop a detailed map of the pathways involved in processing lignin and cellulose by Pseudomonas. The regulation of these pathways will also be studied. The project will extend research opportunities to undergraduates and will engage women with STEM outreach activities at a local high school. 

The project aims to understand the mechanisms of the metabolic networks in wild-type and engineered Pseudomonas putida strains. Mixed-substrate utilization of sugars from cellulose and hemicellulose, and aromatic substrates from lignin will be the primary focus. There are three specific objectives. First, elucidate the metabolic architecture for simultaneous processing of carbons derived from cellulose and lignin monomers. Second, analyze the metabolic network fluxes towards relevant biosynthetic pathways quantitatively. Third, identify the metabolic nodes under regulatory control in the network. The project will employ a combination of stable isotope-assisted metabolomics, proteomics profiling, genome-scale quantitative flux modeling, and in silico predictions of optimal metabolic programming. The long-term goal of this research is to unravel metabolic pathway limitations to converting lignocellulosic feedstock derivatives to value-added building blocks.

This project is being supported jointly by the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering (ENG/CBET) and the Systems and Synthetic Biology (BIO/MCB) Programs.

"Dr. Marco De Jesus and his group at the University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez will adapt bioinspired replicas of naturally occurring and engineered metal nanostructures to gain a deeper understanding of how bacteria interact with nanoscale surfaces whose morphologies are smaller than microorganisms.  The investigators will perform an assessment of the structural parameters which influence bacterial adhesion and colonization to devise new materials with controlled bio-adhesive properties for biomedical and environmental applications.  In collaboration with the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the team will assess the performance of cellular adhesion and colonization onto metal nanoparticle arrays.  Results of these studies have the potential to impact areas of national interest including the construction of advanced biosensors, medical devices, and cellular grafting applications. The project will provide interdisciplinary training and research opportunities to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students in nanotechnology, chemical sensing, and bioanalytical chemistry. The project will involve at least two graduate and six undergraduate students.

This project will  improve our current understanding of how bioactive agents interact with nanomaterials at the liquid/solid interface. Specifically, in collaboration with the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Dr. De Jesus and his team will assess how surface morphology and packing density influence the ability of bacterial cells to attach and colonize nanostructured surfaces.  The team is particularly interested in the impact of these properties on the sorption and effective binding of bacterial agents towards the development of scalable and transferable nanostructures. These nanostructures  can be used to inhibit pathogen proliferation in medical devices and implants and to improve bacterial binding for biosensing and controlled cell adhesion applications. Using competitive binding experiments and multivariate Raman analysis, the team will identify the structural dependence of surface interactions of mixed chemical agents to elucidate surface selectivity and trends for practical quantitation of mixtures. The successful completion of this project will provide new advances toward the rational design of nanomaterials with tailored properties for specific biological applications.  The project will provide research and training opportunities for a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez in nanotechnology applied to biochemical systems, with direct exposure of the graduate students to state-of-the-art facilities at the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences.

"Enzymes are special proteins inside cells that hold chemical reactants in precise positions to accelerate bio-chemical reactions. While they are involved in chemical reactions, enzymes are not used up in the reactions. Studying these reactions at a fundamental level is particularly challenging, because it requires detecting individual enzymes. With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Jeffrey E. Dick at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is advancing electrochemical methods for studying single enzymes. Working with his students, Professor Dick is creating tiny electrodes that can characterize chemical reactions catalyzed by a single enzyme in volumes smaller than a single cell. The project has the potential to offer new ways of studying chemical reactions in cells and impact the development of ultrasensitive biosensors. In addition, the activities provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students who will become the next generation of electrochemists and biotechnologists. The group is also developing electrochemical instruments for use in high schools around the United States, broadening the impact of the project beyond the research laboratory.

With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program is funding Dr. Jeffrey E. Dick at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to develop electrochemical methods to detect and quantify single enzyme molecules. The amount of current a single enzyme produces depends on its maximum turnover rate. Common enzyme turnover rates are on the order of 1000 Hz, implying the amount of current generated by a single enzyme is under a femtoampere. This tiny current cannot be detected and quantified with reasonable bandwidth. With his students, Dr. Dick is developing potentiometric-based methods to address this fundamental limitation. Potentiometry is a powerful technique in that it requires a very small, variable bias current to produce a potential measurement, and the measurement itself is independent of electrode size. The amplification of a single enzyme’s turnover is achieved by trapping a single enzyme molecule within a sub-attoliter volume, synthesized as an emulsion or fabricated via nanofabrication. In these small volumes, effectively a single enzyme biosensor, a single enzyme’s physicochemical properties are rigorously evaluated using novel electrochemistry-based measurement methods developed in this research project. The project also focuses on methods that hold promise to specifically and rapidly detect single virus particles such as COVID-19.

"In recent years a number of infections have passed from non-human animals to humans causing numerous different diseases and creating significant burdens on public health and the economy. In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus whose ancestors likely evolved in a non-human animal. In general, bats host a wide diversity of coronaviruses. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2, like its relative SARS-CoV, the virus that causes SARS, is hypothesized to have its origins in bat hosts. The proposed research seeks to understand how the natural hosts of viruses respond to these infections with a specific focus on bat immunity. Bats are a hugely diverse group that have been linked to numerous emerging human infections but also provide critical ecosystem services such as pest control, seed dispersal and pollination. The research will clarify how bat immunity has shaped the evolution of these viruses. This will yield insights into how to potentially prevent, manage or treat infections in people, as well as protect and better understand bats. The research will also facilitate the training of undergraduate students in genomic laboratory techniques and bioinformatic analysis, training the next generation of scientists. 

Currently, there is a limited understanding of bat immunity, hampered in part by the diversity of bat species and lack of immunological reagents for studying them. In particular, most research has focused on innate immunity in a few species; almost nothing is known about the immunoglobulins and T cells that form the basis of adaptive immunity. The proposed research overcomes these obstacles by using genomic methods to understand adaptive immunity in multiple bat species. Specifically, the proposed research will 1) analyze the germline and rearranged immunoglobulin and T cell receptor repertoires in multiple, diverse bat species, including known coronavirus hosts, using a mix of gene capture, long-read sequencing, and targeted amplification and sequencing; 2) characterize the cells involved in adaptive immunity using single-cell transcriptomics; and 3) test for coronaviruses in wild bats and compare the immunoglobulin repertoire between infected and uninfected bats. The results will provide foundational knowledge of adaptive immunity of an important reservoir group, clarifying the bat-pathogen relationship in multiple species. These findings can be leveraged by others to characterize the responses of bats to specific pathogens, to predict whether certain species are better equipped to respond to infection, and to guide prevention and intervention efforts for zoonotic disease.

"Many organisms use specialized adhesive pads, claws, and similar features to achieve reliable and repeatable attachment to substrates. Ants are the dominant animal in the tropical forest canopy. Worker ants do not have wings, thus effective adhesion is essential for survival. This project will provide the first detailed, comparative evaluation of the mechanisms and consequences of adhesion in tropical ants. Field work will be conducted in lowland forests of Panama and Peru, and the results will have broad implications for ant behavior and ecology globally. This project establishes a formal collaboration among five professionals with complementary skillsets working in distinct fields, from ecology to mechanical engineering. The results will be unprecedented in scope; data collected for more than100 species will provide the most comprehensive evaluation of adhesive performance and behavior in any animal group to date. This project will also provide a framework for the development of advanced industrial adhesives that mimic the chemical, material, and physical properties of ant adhesive pads. These adhesives may be used for medical and industrial applications where strong but reversible adhesion in dynamic conditions is required. Results of this project will be made publicly available in multimedia formats. Project participants will coordinate with Panamanian tour guides to present results to international tourists who visit the field site each year. This project will also improve public understanding of science through formal and informal outreach efforts aimed at K-12 students and their teachers. 

The principal objectives of this study are to quantify the fundamental physical and chemical properties of tarsal adhesion in tropical rainforest canopy ants, and to relate adhesive performance to ant behavior and ecology. The central hypothesis is that adhesive failure determines interspecific differences in ant foraging behavior, local distribution, and frequency of falling. This work will integrate information from field ecology, functional morphology, chemistry, and materials science to answer three basic questions: 1) How do ant adhesive morphology, material properties, and chemistry differ among species, trophic groups, and clades?; 2) Does adhesive versatility (sustained functionality over a range of local environmental conditions) shape ant behavior in the tropical forest canopy?; and 3) What are the ecological patterns and consequences of adhesive failure in tropical arboreal ants? This work will provide the foundation for understanding the ecomorphology and evolution of the ant adhesive system by quantifying adhesive performance under a broad range of natural and experimental conditions. This research employs the latest high-technology chemical, material, and biomechanical analysis methods. As a whole, this project will provide the first comprehensive evaluation of the functional morphology of adhesion in any taxon, with a focus on the ecological consequences of adhesive failure in a lowland tropical forest. During this research, the PIs will provide cross-disciplinary, international education and training for a postdoctoral associate, and undergraduate and graduate students. The results of this work will be used to inform the general public about the ecology and bio-inspired application of ant adhesion.

"Nontechnical Description
This project focuses on the interface between a class of molecules which are magnetic, but where the magnetic properties can be turned on and off, and a different group of molecules whose properties are easily altered by voltage. The overall research goals are to better understand the mechanisms that dominate the voltage manipulation of an unusual class of molecules that can be flipped between being magnetic or not magnetic. There are good reasons to pursue this better understanding. Suitable combinations of molecules, that can be toggled between a state acting like a very small magnet and one having no magnetism, with molecules whose intrinsic properties can be controlled by an applied voltage make it possible to fabricate a molecular ""switch"" that requires very little power to turn on and off. By choosing the right molecule from each class, novel, low cost and extremely low power electronic devices can be made, that can be switched on and off billions of times without degradation. These are devices that can be reduced to the size of a virus particle, or even smaller, which could lead to super high dense computer memories. The cost is low since molecular films can be printed on a wide variety of surfaces. The investigators, having developed this new technology, intend to explore the principles for designing novel and even better molecular materials where magnetism and voltage are intertwined. Student training will include direct international experience in science. Other activities involve both undergraduate and graduate students, including visiting undergraduates, in cutting edge research at the interface of chemistry and physics and outreach activities where the students learn how to communicate cutting edge research to a nontechnical audience.  

Technical Description
This research team has demonstrated voltage controlled nonvolatile transistor-like devices that use molecular spin crossover complexes as the conduction channel. In these systems, the molecular spin state can be tuned by the gate voltage, altering the magnetic properties and the conductance by orders of magnitude. This success opens the door to obtaining deeper insights into possible magneto-electric coupling in molecular systems. This research focuses on a better understanding of the mechanisms that dominate the voltage manipulation of the spin state of these metal-organic complexes. The ultimate aim of investigating suitable combinations of ferroelectric and local moment molecular systems is to find systems with super-large (large electric response to a small magnetic field) or super-small (large magnetic response to a small applied voltage) magneto-electric coefficients. But the core of this research is how intermolecular interaction affects intramolecular configurations, resulting in changes to the ligand field, the molecular dipole, and ultimately the spin state. To accomplish this goal, the investigators will  (1) identify what determines the changes in spin crossover phenomenology with molecular film thickness; (2) determine the energy barriers to spin state switching; (3) learn how a heteromolecular system, where the spin state of the molecular overlayer is altered by an applied electric field, reacts to competing processes; (4) identify the smallest controllable domain size within a continuous film; and (5) identify whether or not a spin orientation anisotropy barrier exists. The combined molecular systems will be characterized by a variety of spectroscopic techniques, magnetometry and scanning probe techniques to determine spin state, ferroelectric polarization, as well as spin crossover activation energies, while thin film heterostructure conductance and magnetic moment will be characterized in the presence of applied magnetic and electric fields at various temperatures.

"Plastics have transformed our lives, largely for the better by providing light-weight, durable materials that can be shaped and stretched.  This said, plastics have generated a significant waste problem, with most plastics sent to the landfill after only one use. These end-of-life outcomes negatively impact our planet and are unsustainable. As such, there is an urgent need to develop new methods to reuse plastic waste. With funding from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Anne J. McNeil of University of Michigan Ann Arbor is utilizing ring-chain equilibria to recycle polyethylene, which is one of the most widely produced plastics in the world. Ring-chain equilibria is a method for polymer recycling in which, under dilute conditions, linear polymers are quantitatively transformed into macrocyclic compounds. When the concentration is increased, linear polymers are regenerated via the reverse process. In this research, a series of chemical reactions are developed to depolymerize different polyethylene scaffolds into cyclic compounds. The developed methodology is utilized to convert post-consumer polyethylene waste into virgin-quality polyethylene. Polyethylene is also repurposed into value-added block copolymers containing important functional chemical groups. The primary goal of the team's outreach efforts is to increase the local community's understanding of the lifecycle of plastics, ranging from petroleum-derived and bio-sourced monomers through their different post-disposal fates. To accomplish this goal, the research team is developing and implementing hands-on activities for children on the plastics lifecycle. In addition, an interactive display for a local children’s museum is being created. Venues such as NerdNite and online publishing are implemented to reach adults. This project enables the participating graduate and undergraduate researchers to gain highly interdisciplinary training in organic and inorganic chemistry, as well as polymer synthesis and characterization. The training also prepares them for careers in teaching and in the chemical industries. 

The research team is developing alkane metathesis for reversible cyclodepolymerization of polyethylene (PE). Research activities include the evaluating of alkane metathesis conditions in the cyclodepolymerization of PE, and the elucidation of the impact of unsaturation levels on cyclodepolymerization rates.  The research group identifies optimized dehydrogenation catalysts for each PE scaffold and generates new PE macrocycles that may exhibit unique properties.  Finally, the group convert post-consumer PE waste into virgin-quality PE, and repurposes PE into value-added block copolymers containing halogen, polar, or alkyl functional groups. This work tackles the grand challenge of polyolefin recyclability and has the potential to have a significant impact on society, both within the scientific community and in the general public.

"SARS-CoV-2 originated from a bat, likely passing through another animal before it infected people. The objective is to determine if two North American native wildlife species can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, which to date has not been evaluated. Skunks and raccoons are closely related to other species that are known to be susceptible with this virus, and are highly abundant in human environments, frequently consuming human refuse. Both species are also handled frequently in wildlife research and rehabilitation settings—creating situations where spillback of the virus from people to them is likely. Further, this study will investigate whether skunk-to-skunk and racoon-to-raccoon transmission is possible, needed to forecast what would happen if this virus spilled into our native wildlife; the worst case scenario is that these species become reservoirs of the virus for people. Skunks and raccoons will be inoculated with two doses of SARS-CoV-2 that represent doses they might encounter the environment, or when in close contact with people. Nasal and fecal samples will be collected after inoculation and tested using two detection methods. Blood will also be collected at intervals to determine if these species create antibodies against the virus. In addition to rapidly disseminating this information to wildlife management agencies, presenting and publishing the results, this work will train three graduate and two undergraduate students on animal husbandry, experimental infections, and various laboratory analyses.

The objective of this study is to identify if two North American native wildlife species that represent a high likelihood of susceptibility and ecological opportunity—skunks and raccoons—are susceptible to infection with SARS-Cov-2. Current phylogenetic evidence indicates a spillover event from an animal host prompted the COVID-19 pandemic, thus, understanding susceptibility of animal species is paramount. Researchers will assess clinical outcome, duration and route of virus shedding, and seroconversion and pathology to understand the: 1) potential reservoir status of these common and abundant, peridomestic, mammalian wildlife species and, 2) likelihood of virus spillover from humans to these species. Results will guide proactive actions to manage contact between humans, domestic animals and wildlife—crucial to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Animals will be acquired from a captive breeder and housed in BSL3 facility. Three pairs of each species will be intranasally inoculated with one of two doses of SARS-CoV-2 (103 and 105 plaque forming units). To determine direct contact transmission, at Day 1 post-inoculation, we will add one animal to each pair of inoculated animals. Post-inoculation, nasal and rectal swabs for qrtPCR and virus isolation and blood samples from both inoculated and direct contact animals will be collected up to 21 days. All animals will be monitored for clinical signs daily by a veterinarian and humanely euthanized, whereby a complete post-mortem examination will be conducted.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the low-cost, high-purity biobased production of glucaric acid, a compound with a broad range of applications.  This production of glucaric acid will enable a broad change from petroleum-based sources for everyday materials, such as nylon in clothes or PET in two-liter bottles, to a bio-based product generated from renewable resources. Similarly, this technology will allow an evolution beyond the traditional phosphates used in water treatment systems to a safer, cost-effective alternative.  

The proposed project will develop a strain, fermentation process, and scalable downstream separation workflow to produce low-cost, high-purity glucaric acid from glucose as a feedstock. Microbial fermentation represents an attractive option for the production of fuels and valuable chemicals from renewable resources, such as cellulosic sugars. Microbes are well suited for the conversion of carbohydrate feedstocks; several examples of their metabolic engineering have been demonstrated to direct these feedstocks to non-natural chemicals and materials of industrial value, often as drop-in replacements for petroleum products. On the other hand, products derived from sugar oxidation pose a new, less explored challenge because of the need to direct glucose into the product pathway rather than the competing path to catabolize the sugar for biomass and energy production. Initial methods, such as deletion of glycolysis and other competing pathways, result in poor glucose uptake because of the cell's complex regulatory circuits. This project proposes to develop strains of E. coli that can efficiently take up glucose while also directing it to the glucaric acid pathway.

"The broader impact/commericalization potential of this I-Corps project is to explore translational opportunities for biomolecule storage, transportation and delivery. The proposed solution, Capture and Release Gels for optimized storage (bioCaRGOS), is capable of storing sensitive biospecimens at low temperatures for long periods of time. Bio-CaRGOS eliminates use of cryo-preservation, freezers, dry ice shipments, and emergency power requirements. The technology will transform the logistics of procuring a biospecimen from a patient in remote locations.  The proposed technology offers several advantages over current techniques including ease of synthesis (only one chemical), fast immobilization (start to finish: 5-minute process), no need of sophisticated equipment (standard microwave), self-sterility, and requirement of minimal technical expertise.Furthermore, it enables delivery and storage of drugs at room temperature, extending shelf life. With CaRGOS, samples could be retrieved, stored and analyze across the globe. 

This I-Corps project is to investigate applications for stabilization of biomolecules. The proposed solution can store sensitive biospecimens, including nucleotides and proteins, at 4, 25, and 40 degrees C for long periods of time. It is a benchtop preservation process, where a hydrolyzed solution of silica precursor (TMOS) is obtained via 30 s exposure to microwave radiation and is subsequently added to a specific biospecimen. The long-term stability of a highly sensitive miRNA21 as well as hemoglobin have been demonstrated; miRNA21 maintains 100% integrity at room temperature and 40 degrees C for up to 3 months, and hemoglobin has shown to be stable for up to 6 months at refrigeration temperature and 1 month at room temperature.

"The goal of this proposal is to increase the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission amongst naïve, recovering or vaccinated individuals. The current COVID pandemic is a stark illustration of the global interdependence between people and other animals. Resumption of normal societal function in the current COVID crisis will require immunity to SARS-CoV-2 either through natural means or through vaccination on a global scale. The rate at which unexposed people (currently most of the human population) become infected or ill is affected by many factors, including the potential for partial immunity (following natural exposure or vaccination) and subsequent reinfection. Use of naturally-occurring related coronaviruses in other animals to emulate this process is a novel and practical approach, and that is the goal of this proposal here. Rat sialodacryoadenitis virus (SADV) has transmission features that closely approximate those of SARS-CoV-2 and a similarly rapid disease course. Animals can be partly protected using another rat coronavirus (RCV) thus emulating vaccination. These characteristics allow researchers to perform rapid transmission studies to produce real transmission data that can be used in predictive models. Broader impacts include that these models can more accurately guide regional preventive measures such as social distancing, to minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread.  An additional broader impact is the training of several junior scientists, and an all-female set of investigators, broadening participation of science. 

This proposal will use sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), a rat coronavirus with transmission features that closely approximate those of SARS-Cov2, to generate in vivo transmission estimates in rats informing a data-driven core SEIRS (Susceptible - Exposed – Infected – Recovered - Susceptible) simulation model. In Aim 1, rates of infection and recovery will be determined in susceptible (naïve) rats following exposure to SDAV. Thus, this models the current global dynamic of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. In Aims 2 and 3, the rates of infection and recovery will be determined in convalescing rats from aim 1 who receive a second near-term or long-term exposure to SDAV, respectively. This assesses the potential for individuals with recent naturally-acquired immunity to shed virus and models the near-term dynamics of SARS Cov-2 (aim 2), and the potential for individuals with waning naturally acquired immunity to shed virus and models the near to long-term dynamic of SARS CoV-2 (aim 3). Aim 4 will determine rates of infection and recovery in rats vaccinated with a related rat coronavirus (RCV), a vaccination known to provide partial immunity against SDAV, following exposure to SDAV shedding rats. This aim assesses the potential for individuals developing variable vaccine acquired immunity to shed virus and models the long-term dynamic of SARS CoV-2. Estimates obtained in Aims 1-4 will be used to construct a core mathematical model in NumerusMB. This will allow simulation of complex scenarios testing the effects of vaccination and social mixing on the susceptible population.

"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has now infected more than 6,000,000 people worldwide, 370,000 of whom have died. Coronaviruses are notorious for jumping into new host species; indeed SARS-CoV-2 originated via spillover from a wildlife reservoir species, most likely a species of Old World bat, into humans. Arrival of SARS-CoV-2 in the Americas has created an opportunity for the virus to jump into New World bats, which could severely complicate the current public health emergency and threaten bat conservation. A major barrier to identifying which North American bat species are at greatest risk of SARS-CoV-2 “spillback” is the current lack of knowledge about the distribution of coronaviruses in North American bats.  To close this knowledge gap 17 target bat species in the Southwest U.S.A. will be characterized for their “viromes” with an emphasis on coronaviruses, and also their the sequence of their cellular receptor, ACE-2, to which SARS-CoV-2 binds. Within species, bats of different sexes, ages and breeding status will be sampled. Molecular data will be combined with information on bat behaviors, migration, group size, and tendency to live near humans, to predict risk of spillback of SARS-CoV-2. Per the NSF-DCL, the results of the project will be used to model and understand the spread of COVID-19. As an additional broader impact, training of a graduate student will be supported by these funds.

This project focuses on characterizing the susceptibility of North American bats to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Specifically, two hypotheses will be tested: (i) that susceptibility of New World bat species may be based on genetics, behavior and life stage of each bat species, and (ii) that bat species with a high prevalence and diversity of native coronaviruses may be intrinsically resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to competitive exclusion. Serum, rectal and oral swab samples, wing punches and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), will be collected from 17 bat species across a spectrum of behaviors (sociality, migration, peridomesticity). Within each species, fifty individuals, including, when possible, both sexes and all age and breeding stages, will be sampled in sites of human-bat overlap in New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado. Samples will be processed for virome characterization using metagenomics based on next-generation DNA sequencing, incorporating recently developed methods that enrich clinical samples for coronaviruses and enable rapid whole-genome sequencing of known and unknown coronaviruses. Additionally, ACE-2 will be sequenced from a subset of individuals in each species. Associations between virus occurrence, prevalence and mean load and behavioral traits and life stage will be analyzed using phylogenetic generalized mixed models and information theory. This study will shed light on how bat behavior, ecology, infection, and ACE-2 sequence may enable or prevent spillback of introduced viruses, with SARS-CoV-2 serving as a critically important study system.

"This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) award supports research to understand virus-host interactions that may lead to increased morbidity in COVID19 patients with pre-existing inflammatory conditions. Current data suggests that of all US patients with COVID-19, 74% had pre-existing hypertension, and 30% had diabetes. A key feature COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is caused by the infiltration of monocyte/macrophages (MOs). Monocyte/macrophages are key members of the innate immune system that maintain tissue homeostasis. This is because they phagocytose foreign pathogens and dying cells, and this stimulates with the adaptive immune system to make antibodies. However, it is not well-understood how monocyte/macrophages are affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, the causative agent of COVID-19. The goal of this study is to understand how SARS-CoV-2 exacerbates monocyte function in monocytes from healthy individuals as compared to individuals with diabetes. Results from this research may identify therapeutics to minimize COVID-19 disease. This research involves several disciplines including immunology, virology, and biomedical engineering. This multi-disciplinary approach will help broaden participation of under-represented groups in research, as well as contribute to the immunological study of COVID-19 health disparity populations. This proposal also supports the training of a post-doctoral fellow, a graduate and undergraduate student. 

There are clinical observations of high monocyte/macrophage activation observed in COVID19 patients. However, the intracellular events that lead to this activation are unknown. This project will build on existing measurements of SARS-CoV-2 infection from other cell types, and now provides vital missing information about monocyte/macrophage functions and responses to infection. The objective of the research is to determine (1) the contributions of healthy and diabetic monocytes to SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytokine release storms, and (2) the global role of virus-host interactions with key receptors on monocytes that are dysregulated (upregulated or downregulated expression compared to normal physiological function). The study will increase the knowledge of how impaired macrophage functions from diabetic people may affect outcomes of COVID-19 disease. Results from this study can help aid the development of desperately needed therapies for COVID-19.

"This research will increase our understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between species, focusing on bats, hamsters, and deer mice. This knowledge is urgently needed because the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is causing the COVID-19 pandemic and is being spread rapidly and globally by humans. It is therefore coming into contact with many potential novel hosts. This is problematic for a number of reasons: (1) novel hosts could serve as intermediate or amplifying hosts in which viral mutations occur that impact efficiency for zoonotic transmission or pathogenesis, (2) novel hosts could become new reservoirs for the virus, (3) there could be a heavy disease toll on the hosts with major economic ramifications if they are livestock, or with ecological ramifications if they are wildlife, and (4) infection of more hosts, including potential spillback to bats, increases the chances of genesis of yet more novel coronaviruses. It is known that SARS-CoV mutated over the 2002-2004 epidemic to become more virulent. It is likely there will be recurrent waves of SARS-CoV-2 with altered virulence as it spreads globally. It is therefore critically important to increase our knowledge about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between species. Knowledge of routes of infection will help prevent transmission and can influence the clinical outcome of diseases. This research also will provide an exceptional interdisciplinary training opportunity for a postdoctoral fellow.

This research will examine why transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs by a fecal-oral route in some animals, such as bats, but can be airborne in others, such as hamsters, deer mice and humans. The project will lead to a better understanding of why the lungs of bats remain uninfected when the respiratory system is exposed to the virus by inhalation. Insufflated particles may be filtered in the upper airways, lung cells may lack the cellular machinery required for viral entry [angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors and the serine protease TMPRSS2], or the virus may enter cells but not replicate within them. The following experiments will be conducted in bat, hamster, and deer mice that are inoculated by direct contact or by insufflation of viral laden aerosol: (1) Regions within the respiratory system where insufflated aerosolized particles are most likely to be deposited during breathing will be modeled using computational fluid dynamics. (2) Maps of cells that express ACE2, TMPRSS2, and viral RNA within the respiratory system and the small intestine will be generated using RNAscope. (3) These maps will be compared to measurements of viral protein assayed with immunohistochemistry. In addition to new knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 transmission, this project will provide basic information about lung physiology and cell biology in three mammal species, and will provide interdisciplinary training for a post-doctoral fellow.

"Understanding the complex behavior and interaction between extremely tiny particles (nanoparticles) and living organisms is of crucial importance in advancing the science of drug delivery, as well as proactively preventing the environmental, health and safety ramifications after inhalation of noxious gases and/or infectious airborne particles. Once inhaled, nanoparticles immediately adsorb biological molecules normally found in the surface lining of the lung, enveloping the nanoparticle with a unique biomolecular corona that defines its subsequent cellular interactions. To date, little is known about the biological and physicochemical driving forces regulating the formation of the biomolecular corona. It is also unknown what potential deleterious effects may result from the interactions of these corona-covered particles on the human lung. Thus, the goal of this research project is to develop novel experimental methods for understanding the thermodynamic driving forces responsible for the formation of the biomolecular corona of inhaled nanoparticles. Understanding the dynamics of these pulmonary/nanoparticle interactions will provide novel insights into the mechanism of pulmonary toxicity of inhaled nanoparticles. By collaborating with local healthcare providers, the overarching goal is to apply the knowledge gained from this research to elucidate the environmental risks of a library of nanoparticles, particularly those that are likely to adversely affect the lungs of infants and children. Through the unique location of the University of Hawaii, the investigator is dedicated to promoting participation in this research with Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and students from underrepresented minority groups.

The objective of this research project is to test a novel hypothesis that the surface free energy of nanoparticles regulates the structure and chemical composition of the pulmonary surfactant biomolecular corona, using a combined experimental and computational approach. Although it is well known that the hydrophobicity of nanoparticles plays a critical role in defining the structure and chemical configuration of the biomolecular corona, the biomolecular events have never been elucidated or systematically studied. This is largely due to the lack of quantitative methods for characterizing the hydrophobicity of nanoparticles. The PI will fill this gap by developing a novel optical method for determining the surface free energy of nanoparticles as a quantitative measure of its hydrophobicity. This method relies on an innovative measuring principle of manipulating the intermolecular forces between nanoparticles across liquid media. The methodology is both unique and innovative, and distinctly different from existing methods. Once developed and validated, it has the potential to offer a standard, low-cost, and easy-to-use method for quantitatively characterizing the surface free energy and hydrophobicity of particulate matter. The PI will experimentally study particle-size dependent surface free energy, and the energetic effect of the biomolecular corona utilizing a library of pristine nanoparticles. Knowledge from this study will provide insight into the thermodynamic driving forces at play in the formation of the biomolecular corona. This research will also advance the current understanding of the nano-bio interaction in the lungs and bridge the gap between the available biophysicochemical data and nanotoxicological data. Broader implications include a translational research methodology and approach in designing nanoparticle-based pulmonary drug delivery systems and in furthering an understanding of the pathophysiology of respiratory injury caused by noxious air pollutants and other environmental respiratory hazards. Ultimately, the developed technology offers the potential for widespread usage in many platforms, both in the laboratory and in studies performed on humans to improve respiratory health.  The PI is actively engaged in the Native Hawaiian Science & Engineering Mentorship Program (NHSEMP) and the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) at the University of Hawaii. The PI will support one graduate student  and several undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups.

"Why are bats so likely to carry coronaviruses, yet seem little affected by them? Many studies have focused on their immune system, but there is much to learn about the cells viruses attack upon entry. Acute respiratory symptoms, as well as the curious loss of the sense of smell in human patients with COVID-19 hint that cells in the nasal passage are afflicted first. Indeed, cells that produce mucus in the nose, known as goblet cells, have been shown to be “ground zero” for viral entry. Since these cells are also present in bat noses, there must be a difference in how coronaviruses attack goblet cells in bats versus humans. However, virtually nothing is known about immune-related proteins in bat goblet cells. This project proposes a new approach to understand how bats are resistant to respiratory viruses such as those related to SARS-CoV-2. By generating a multi-dimensional study of the anatomy and physiology of the upper respiratory tract —nose and pharynx— of bats, the proposed work will enable researchers to better understand how viruses enter the body and infect or fail to infect their hosts. This project will also allow health agencies around the world to better survey bat populations and prevent future pandemics similar to COVID-19.  In addition, this proposal supports a graduate student and post-doctoral fellow to increase training in STEM fields.  

Researchers supported by this award will test the hypothesis that bats with nasal anatomy similar to humans have a specific composition of the lining of their respiratory tract, evolved to prevent viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, from infecting them. To understand how the lining, or epithelium, is modified in bats compared to humans, this grant will compare the proteins, DNA, and histology of bats to humans and mice. The proposed work will highlight the role of goblet cells, which do not only produce mucus, but also have immune and inflammatory functions, as critical for infection from- versus resistance to viral attack. The team will also integrate layers of data, from 3D imaging to proteomics, to build a complete picture of the inner and outer workings of the upper respiratory tracts of bats. By visualizing the anatomy in high resolution and uncovering which specific proteins are produced by the lining of the bat’s nasal passage, this project will produce the most thorough study of the upper respiratory tracts of bats yet. This will be critical for humanity’s fight against zoonotic viruses, and surveillance of wildlife populations.

Researchers supported by this award will test the hypothesis that bats with nasal anatomy similar to humans have a specific composition of the lining of their respiratory tract, evolved to prevent viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, from infecting them. To understand how the lining, or epithelium, is modified in bats compared to humans, this grant will compare the proteins, DNA, and histology of bats to humans and mice. The proposed work will highlight the role of goblet cells, which do not only produce mucus, but also have immune and inflammatory functions, as critical for infection from- versus resistance to viral attack. The team will also integrate layers of data, from 3D imaging to proteomics, to build a complete picture of the inner and outer workings of the upper respiratory tracts of bats. By visualizing the anatomy in high resolution and uncovering which specific proteins are produced by the lining of the bat’s nasal passage, this project will produce the most thorough study of the upper respiratory tracts of bats yet. This will be critical for humanity’s fight against zoonotic viruses, and surveillance of wildlife populations.

"Why are bats so likely to carry coronaviruses, yet seem little affected by them? Many studies have focused on their immune system, but there is much to learn about the cells viruses attack upon entry. Acute respiratory symptoms, as well as the curious loss of the sense of smell in human patients with COVID-19 hint that cells in the nasal passage are afflicted first. Indeed, cells that produce mucus in the nose, known as goblet cells, have been shown to be “ground zero” for viral entry. Since these cells are also present in bat noses, there must be a difference in how coronaviruses attack goblet cells in bats versus humans. However, virtually nothing is known about immune-related proteins in bat goblet cells. This project proposes a new approach to understand how bats are resistant to respiratory viruses such as those related to SARS-CoV-2. By generating a multi-dimensional study of the anatomy and physiology of the upper respiratory tract —nose and pharynx— of bats, the proposed work will enable researchers to better understand how viruses enter the body and infect or fail to infect their hosts. This project will also allow health agencies around the world to better survey bat populations and prevent future pandemics similar to COVID-19.  In addition, this proposal supports a graduate student and post-doctoral fellow to increase training in STEM fields.

"With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Professor Eugene Chen in the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University. Professor Chen is designing catalyst systems for the synthesis of advanced polymeric materials that are biodegradable and chemically circular (can be deconstructed back into their component parts). The central goal of this program is to develop polymerization catalysts that can directly convert mixtures of monomer diastereomers (molecules that have the same bond connections but different three-dimensional structure) into new high-performance biodegradable materials with defined three-dimensional structure. Deconstruction of the polymers into fragments that can be joined back together into monomers is also being studied. This work is developing new catalytic processes for the atom- and energy-efficient synthesis of polymeric materials. The proposed research encompasses diverse areas of the chemical sciences, materials engineering, and sustainability, thereby providing an excellent opportunity for the training and teaching of students, including underrepresented and undergraduate students. This project also addresses the critical need to improve polymer recyclability and Professor Chen is emphasizing the importance of this sustainability issue in workshops, lectures, and presentations. 

New catalysts that can polymerize diastereomeric mixtures of monomers at any rac/meso ratio into stereo-sequenced polymers have the potential to transform the synthesis of high-performance crystalline materials. Diastereoselective polymerization not only avoids the material loss and added energy costs associated with diastereomeric pre-separation and purification required by traditional stereoselective polymerization methods, but also utilizes all of the diastereomers in a mixture to modulate material properties. This study is advancing diastereoselective polymerization catalysis to achieve direct polymerization of diastereomeric monomer mixtures into isotactic/syndiotactic stereo-sequenced biodegradable crystalline polymers. The approach involves designing diastereomer-selective and earth-abundant catalysts as well as examining catalyst structure–selectivity relationships via a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Furthermore, catalysis-enabled chemical circularity of the synthesized polymers is being developed to transform these materials back to their monomers, thus closing the loop of their life cycles. This program uses a rational catalyst/monomer design approach to advance polymeric materials and methodologies by emphasizing fundamental concepts related to ditacticity and diastereoselectivity. These studies serve as an excellent training ground for aspiring undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral chemists of diverse backgrounds.

"Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused two serious epidemics in humans (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) and the current COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV2). There is evidence suggesting that although these CoVs originated from bats, other mammals could have been intermediate hosts that transmitted the virus to humans. Research supported by this award will help to identify animal populations that are likely susceptible to the current pandemic CoV (SARS-CoV2) and could potentially act as viral reservoirs and initiate new disease outbreaks. Determining the animal receptors that enable SARS-CoV2 cell entry will benefit both human and animal health by directing future studies of CoV tropism. This knowledge will also focus surveillance efforts to species most likely involved in zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV2 and other CoVs. This proposal will train undergraduate research students in computational and laboratory skills during the proposed project.  Results from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, posted to shared data repositories, and also shared through social media.

Research supported by this award will employ computational modeling and empirical laboratory research to identify animal angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptors that confer susceptibility to SARS-CoV2. Researchers will test the hypothesis that certain amino acid residues in animal ACE2 are essential for coronavirus (CoV) spike protein interaction and cell entry. A computational pipeline will be developed to model and simulate the docking of the SARS-CoV2 receptor binding domain to the ACE2 cell receptor from hundreds of divergent animal species. We will also empirically test the capacity of SARS-CoV2 spike protein to utilize ACE2 through heterologous expressions systems and in vitro cell culture studies. The research has the potential to identify a wide spectrum of animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV2. This will aid in the understanding of the relationship between ACE2 genotype and SARS-CoV2 cell entry and allow the prediction of ACE2 residues that are critical for determining CoV susceptibility.

"Bats appear to have co-evolved with coronaviruses (CoVs) for millennia. The CoVs that bats carry include the closest relatives of SARS-COV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. The relationship between the bat host and CoV virus appears to have selected for immune tolerance that enables bats to control CoV replication and yet avoid immune damage. Although some novel CoV hosts (humans) are able to manage and clear the virus without significant consequence, many do not, falling victim instead to a pathological inflammatory response that results from overly-exuberant immune signaling. Understanding how bats avoid this deleterious path may provide insight into new disease mitigation strategies. The researchers supported by this award will leverage a large existing set of bat samples to better understand how bats respond to infection with CoVs. Beyond these direct COVID-19 societal benefits, this project will benefit society by training young scientists in disease ecology and in bioinformatics, preparing them for future careers in the transdisciplinary STEM workforce.  Data from this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, and shared through public data repositories.

The purpose of this study is to identify immune mechanisms associated with tolerance of Coronavirus (CoV) infections in bats. Gaining information on bat responses to CoV infections will shed light on the mechanisms of effective immune control. Parallel study of (1) the CoV virome, and (2) the accompanying gene up- or down-regulation in response to infection will reveal immune system signatures of viral tolerance and advance fundamental understandings of antiviral immunity. By comparing responses in the African little epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus labiatus), which host beta-CoVs, and the North American little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus), which host alpha-CoVs, the common mechanisms of tolerance to both alpha- and beta-CoVs will be determined. A powerful dual RNA sequencing approach will be deployed to simultaneously sequence the virome and the host transcriptome. Using weighted gene correlation network analysis, gene expression counts will be used to determine gene networks in the host that are most tightly correlated to each CoV infection. These correlated gene networks will be analyzed functionally to determine which immune pathways are associated with CoV tolerance by either blocking inflammation and immune activation or by dampening tissue damage. Finally, the functions of these co-regulated genes will be compared to those documented in novel hosts (human and other animals).

"Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) in electronic systems has been widely recognized as one of the key enablers for several emerging applications. However, the energy efficiency and the learning capabilities of state-of-the-art AI systems is far from that achievable by human brains. This research undertakes a cross-layer exploration spanning novel devices, low-power neural networks, and new learning schemes. The exploration will exploit Ferroelectric Field Effect Transistor (FeFET) technology with intrinsic neuro-mimetic features to achieve energy-efficient neural hardware and adaptable learning. The low-power hardware solutions and adaptive-learning algorithms have the potential to impact critical applications such as computer-aided diagnosis, robotics, speech/face recognition, and data classification, thereby directly benefiting areas such as healthcare, defense, security etc. Moreover, power savings should translate to longer battery life for edge devices and energy-efficient data processing for applications like wearable health-monitoring platforms. The project will leverage outreach programs at Purdue University and develop a summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program to involve undergraduates and minority students in the project. The broad nature of this project will provide opportunity for undergraduate students to get introduced to the field of AI based on emerging technologies.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), due to their self-learning capabilities, show promise in introducing adaptability in learning for AI systems, but suffer from low accuracy. Improving SNN accuracy and performance not only necessitates novel learning mechanisms that support adaptable lifelong learning, but also an intrinsically suitable technology for low-power scalable hardware. To address this critical need, this project will carry out a comprehensive devices-to-algorithms exploration of multi-domain FeFET based SNNs. The main objectives include (a) design of low-power neurons and synapses using FeFETs, and (b) development of adaptive and sequential learning algorithms utilizing the unique attributes of the neuro-mimetic devices. To enable bio-plausible features in FeFETs, physics-based device optimization will be carried out to utilize the multi-domain effects and domain dynamics of ferroelectrics. To facilitate cross-layer exploration, a devices-to-systems simulation framework will be developed capturing the rich dynamics of the neurons and synapses, their interactions in an SNN, and the impact of new learning algorithms on system performance/accuracy.

"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY

The current COVID-19 pandemic is a severe threat to human health leading to unprecedented social and economic disruption all over the world. All scientific organizations in different disciplines are fully mobilized to combat this terrible pandemic in various capacities. 
This award focuses on the fundamental understanding of the nature of this virus and how it attacks the human cell, leading to means to mitigate its detrimental effects. The research targets the structure and properties of a crucial COVID-19 protein using large-scale computational modeling. The objective is to obtain highly accurate and reliable structure data and investigate both inter-molecular and intra-molecular binding mechanisms at the atomic scale.
The supported research is critically important in understanding the modification of the human cell under virus attack, providing insights for vaccine development and antivirus drug design at a much reduced cost by supplementing experimental data with computation. The fundamental understanding of the COVID-19 virus will have a profound socioeconomic impact domestically and internationally.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY

This award supports the computational modeling and structure refinement of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The research is challenging because of the structural complexity, the large number of atoms to be dealt with, the accuracy required for meaningful interpretation and the urgency associated with COVID-19 pandemic.  

This research includes the calculation of the electronic structure and interatomic bonding using first-principles density functional theory based on methods uniquely suited for this purpose.  The spike (S) glycoprotein (S-protein) in SARS-COV-2 is the key element in understanding the anatomy of the virus, since it makes the first contact with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) in the human cell. The structure of the S-protein was determined by cryo-EM technique with a resolution of 3.5 Å. This resolution is not sufficiently fine for detailed calculations aimed at drug design.  This research addresses that deficiency computationally. The S-protein consists of three chains (A, B, C), each consisting of four structural domains: receptor binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), and subdomains S1 and S2. This project will mostly focus on the RBD, which has 144 amino acids with a total of 2100 atoms. The structure of the entire Chain A in the spike protein has 959 amino acids and 14482 atoms. Refinement of the structures of these domains and investigation of the electronic structure and interatomic bonding, including hydrogen bonding, of the spike protein in both the pre- and post-fusion conformations provides the urgently needed information lacking in prior research. The structural data obtained here are to be deposited in an appropriate data bank and made available to the scientific community. 
This award supports the research using large-scale ab-initio computation, in conjunction with experimental verification, to identify the salient features in novel complex virus systems. Such a strategy is increasingly popular with the use of high accuracy cyro-EM measurements. The tightly coupled feedback between computational modeling, formal theory and experimental exploration is important for fundamental research in biomaterials and physical virology. 

The supported research has a wide range of broader impacts. First, novel insights generated from the research paves the way for applications in vaccine development and drug design. Second, the planned research aligns with educational goals by involving a postdoctoral fellow, graduate and undergraduate students, and external collaborators. This awarded project emphasizes the inclusion of women and minorities, where students work as a team in a boundary-free environment of modern science and engineering.

"Proposed in response to a “Dear colleague letter” to fund research to fight the coronavirus pandemic, this project will study the impact of obesity, diabetes, and gender on disease severity and transmission in a mouse model of coronavirus disease. Mouse models must be used to study this disease since humans cannot be infected due to ethical reasons. Obese and diabetic people, along with males, are at a higher risk for severe coronavirus disease, which is concerning since 42% of Americans are obese, 30% are pre-diabetic, and 9.4% have diabetes, while 49.2% are male. It is currently unknown why these groups of people are at higher risk for severe disease, a question that must be answered to develop effective treatments and public health campaigns. The value of this research to the taxpayers is that the information gained will generate data necessary to create effective vaccines and antivirals and identify ways to control coronavirus transmission. In addition, this model will have broad interest to researchers studying the modeling of transmission dynamics, virus-host interactions, immunology, antivirals, and understanding basic virus biology. If successful, these studies will provide a model with the potential to transform the way research with these  SARS-CoV-2  is currently done.   The borader impacts of this work include mentoring a graduate student and undergraduate students in infectious disease research to train the next generation of STEM researchers.

Currently, no models to study the impacts of co-morbidities or identify biomarkers of disease severity or transmission on COVID-19 exist. The goals of this project are to define the impact of obesity, diabetes, and sex on disease severity and transmission in the context of different viral and host genotypes using a natural model of mouse infection with the murine hepatitis virus (MHV). The two strains of mice display differential susceptibility to severe disease to the two strains of mouse coronavirus—from asymptomatic to 80% mortality. Furthermore, MHV is highly transmissible mouse-to-mouse, which is unlikely to occur with SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice. Accordingly, this is an excellent model system with which to gather immunological, viral, and other data from infected mice to identify potential biomarkers of severe disease or transmission. Levels of MHV in the blood and oral passages, gene expression, cytokine levels, blood parameters, clinical disease, tissue pathology, and mortality will be the phenotypes used to compare to disease severity and transmission to identify associations. The hypothesis is that pro-inflammatory cytokines (notably interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and CXCL10) and concentration of virus in the blood or oral passages can be used to predict disease severity and transmission, respectively. These studies will increase understanding of the underlying biology of coronaviruses, virus and host interactions, the genotype, phenotype, and environmental factors influencing coronavirus disease and transmission, and may identify biomarkers to predict disease severity and transmission in people with COVID-19.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of new antimicrobial materials to reduce the spread of harmful bacteria and viruses in a variety of settings, particularly for self-disinfecting personal protection equipment against SARS-CoV-2 to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. While primarily intended for use in hospitals, these antimicrobial materials can also impact bio-defense; military facilities; food processing, packaging, and service industries; wastewater treatment facilities; daycare and long-term care facilities; and even personal households. Beyond the current pandemic, this technology can address hospital-acquired infections, which add an estimated $30-45 billion to health care costs every year; and the food service industry, where norovirus foodborne infections alone account for an economic loss of about $5.8 B annually in the United States.  The proposed technology offers significant benefit for the current COVID-19 challenge and beyond. 

The proposed project will develop light-activated surface-disinfecting materials based on photodynamic inactivation that generates singlet oxygen – a highly reactive yet environmentally benign species – to cause non-specific damage to microbes, rendering them inactive. The technical challenges are: 1) the development of chemical species capable of producing singlet oxygen upon exposure to light, but stable at the high temperatures of manufacturing processes, for which we will start with a known class of compounds; 2) the development of a method for the production and embedding of the newly-developed photoreactive compounds within relevant materials, particularly for the manufacture of personal protection equipment; and 3) evaluation of process efficacy for virucidal (against coronaviruses), antibacterial, antimycotic and sporicidal use.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to investigate translation of new bioplastic materials as an alternative solution to petroleum-based materials.  The growing environmental concerns regarding the accumulation of microplastics inspires a need for new alternative materials. Petroleum-based products (plastics, fibers such as polyester, nylon, etc.) are notorious for their persistence in the environment because they are not biodegradable when disposed in landfills. From an environmental perspective, it is crucial to develop materials based on cellulose. In addition, cotton is one of the most important cash crops in the United States and most produced cotton fibers go to the textile industry. However, low micronaire (low quality in terms of textile spinning) is a recurring problem and can potentially be applied to other niche markets. 

This I-Corps project is to explore applications of biodegradable materials from cellulose biopolymer derived from low quality cotton fibers. Although considered as waste or discounted for textile applications, these fibers are a premium source of highly crystalline and high-molecular weight cellulose. The technology converts cellulose to a solution and subsequently to commodity products currently produced from petroleum-derived polymers. Proof-of-concept has been demonstrated through producing 3D printed materials, bioplastic films (flexible and stiff), and porous materials.  The ability of this technology to dissolve high molecular weight cellulose (derived from cotton fibers) and its conversion to bioproducts allows preparation of superior performance and versatile cellulose-based bioproducts.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project is advancing the development of environmentally safe packaging. The global packaging market has been estimated to grow to $980 B in 2022, with lids estimated at $1.4 B in 2020. As 40% of plastic is created for one-time-use, a need exists for innovative packaging. The current petroleum plastic lids are not sustainable nor recycled and they do not break down in the environment. The proposed solution is a new class of hot and cold drink lids that are low-cost, can be recycled with paper, and will not harm the ocean environment if littered. 

This STTR Phase I project proposes to advance the translation of a method to use highly refined wood cellulose microfibers, combined with calcium carbonate and other low-cost additives, to generate a lid that mimics the feel of current plastic polypropylene and polystyrene lids but provides excellent environmental performance. The environmental impact will be tested via decomposition time, and ocean impact by zebrafish embryo exposure effects and mortality.  The proposed solution will demonstrate environmental decomposing behavior not obtained with any petroleum or corn plastic material. The technical hurdles include molding and drying this new pulp into an automated lid production process at scale. This project will characterize this new pulp.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that sharing data is critical to building better statistical epidemiological models, enabling policy decisions (in the public and private sector), and assuring the health of the public. Moreover, the situation has evolved quickly, indicating that data sharing needs to take place repeatedly and in a timely manner. To date, much of the data sharing that has taken place has focused on aggregate statistics (e.g., counts of events), yet some of the most important data is at the person-level, which is critical to providing intuition into how comorbidities influence health outcomes and model the trajectory of the disease in a temporal-spatial perspective. This data is captured by a large number of service providers who wish to support these endeavors, but are concerned that doing so will infringe upon the privacy rights of the corresponding individuals, particularly their anonymity. To enable timely, useful and privacy-preserving releases of patient specific COVID-19 data, this project aims to develop and disseminate novel privacy-risk assessment techniques, implemented in working software, to assist data managers, as well as public health officials, to reason about the tradeoffs between privacy risks (with a focus on re-identification, according to current law) and public data utility. The project will provide the best practices and tools needed for sharing patient-specific data about individuals diagnosed with, or suspected of, COVID-19. 

This project will develop novel, and dynamic privacy risk assessment models for disclosing data in support of epidemiological investigations (and particularly pandemics) by considering evolving privacy risks and data utility. In doing so, the proposed models will be tailored to enable the disclosure of geographic-, demographic-, and clinically-relevant phenomena (e.g., health indications based on pharmaceutical prescriptions or purchases) by modeling a much richer data attribute space, specifically one that is important for modeling epidemiologic risk factors associated with biological agents, such as COVID-19. To model evolving privacy risks, privacy risk estimation models that consider multiple types of potential re-identification attacks and data redactions used to release multiple versions of the same data will be developed. Furthermore, the proposed models will be oriented to support utility functions that are specific to bio-surveillance efforts, including those which have emerged for COVID-19 modeling and response. Finally, to ensure that the proposed approach is accessible and reusable widely, an open source software tool, that enables data custodians, and particularly public health authorities, to make informed decisions appropriately balancing public health goals with personal privacy when sharing data, will be released.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted a critical need for reliable PPE for medical professionals and essential workers.  This project aims to fabricate self-sterilizing personal protective equipment (PPE) material. The material will be made using electrospinning, which produces small-diameter fibers. The fibrous material will be treated with two types of biocidal agents to destroy pathogens such as viruses. These materials are expected to be transformative because they offer the potential for extended use and/or reuse of PPE. This will aid in both reducing PPE shortages in times of increased use and contribute to reduced waste. The investigators have identified hospital and industrial partners for this project. Additionally, future applications of these materials may include filtration systems for hospitals, on airplanes, and in homes and buildings, and to protect those working in agriculture.

This proposal aims to produce biocidal filtration materials by electrospinning and adding novel biocide and antimicrobial treatments (tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles) to produce PPE that captures and neutralizes viral pathogens. The investigators hypothesize that these novel antimicrobial composites will exhibit synergistic performance for virus inactivation by coupling physical and (bio)chemical removal mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, filter materials of varying fiber diameters will be electrospun from polystyrene and poly(vinylidene fluoride), and their filtrations performance will be evaluated using various sized polystyrene beads. The outcome of the project will be fundamental understanding of the synergistic effects of surfactant biocide (TBAB), antimicrobial silver, and easy-to-synthesize, electrospun materials.

Additionally, future applications of these materials may include filtration systems for hospitals, on airplanes, and in homes and buildings, and to protect those working in agriculture.

This proposal aims to produce biocidal filtration materials by electrospinning and adding novel biocide and antimicrobial treatments (tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles) to produce PPE that captures and neutralizes viral pathogens. The investigators hypothesize that these novel antimicrobial composites will exhibit synergistic performance for virus inactivation by coupling physical and (bio)chemical removal mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, filter materials of varying fiber diameters will be electrospun from polystyrene and poly(vinylidene fluoride), and their filtrations performance will be evaluated using various sized polystyrene beads. The outcome of the project will be fundamental understanding of the synergistic effects of surfactant biocide (TBAB), antimicrobial silver, and easy-to-synthesize, electrospun materials.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in untold challenges to personal and public health, largely because scientists and clinicians know very little about the virus that causes it and how transmission occurs. Whereas respiratory droplets are known to be a major mode of transmission, it is very likely that there are other sources. One understudied possibility is transmission from mother to infant via breastfeeding. Although researchers know that some viruses can be passed from mother to infant in this fashion, almost nothing is known about SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). For this reason, there is substantial confusion as to whether breastfeeding is safe and/or beneficial when a mother is known to be infected. This study will provide fundamental information about this basic biological property of SARS-CoV-2, information that will be immediately usable by women, healthcare providers, and public policy makers. This study will investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be detected in breast milk produced by infected women. Results will provide needed information about potential spread of the disease between breastfeeding mothers and infants as compared to formula-feeding mothers and infants. This topic is urgent because women continue to give birth and breastfeed during the pandemic, and guidance is critically needed. The Broader Impacts of this project include both outreach to the public to inform breastfeeding mothers about breast-feeding choices, and education of an undergraduate and graduate student.

Although respiratory droplets are a known source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, other modes likely exist. One such possibility is SARS-CoV-2  vertical transmission during breastfeeding, but little is known about this type of transfer for any coronaviruses. For SARS-CoV-2, there are only a handful of studies that report analysis of milk produced by COVID-19+ women; all but three report no evidence of virus in milk. There is similarly limited research on the effects of maternal milk antibodies on infant immune responses and severity of symptoms. As a result, there is substantial confusion as to the risks and benefits of breastfeeding for SARS-CoV-2+ mothers. This proposed research is a longitudinal, repeated-measures study of 25 breastfeeding mothers and infants and 25 formula-feeding mothers and infants. Dyads will be recruited within 7 days of maternal COVID-19 diagnosis and followed for 2 months during which time milk and breast swabs will be repeatedly collected (from breastfeeding mothers) and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using an RT-qPCR; milk will also be analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Stool samples will also be collected and analyzed to assess viral exposure/shedding; and dried blood spots collected and analyzed to assess viremia and antibody (IgG and IgA) titers. Results will immediately inform women, healthcare providers, and public policy makers regarding infant feeding choices during the postpartum period.

"The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading, causing severe illness and death, as well as widespread disruption to all aspects of society. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand how the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of COVID-19, causes infection. This is the focus of this project. The virus first gains access through the upper airways through aerosols or through contact with contaminated materials. The actual infection process involves contact of the virus with the surface of the cells lining the airways. This surface contains various types of glycans or polysaccharides, which are strings of different sugars connected to each other and to proteins and fats that surround the airway cells. First contact with glycans subsequently leads to virus entry into the cell. Very little is known about these glycans and how SARS-CoV-2 exploits them as a portal of entry. This research addresses this fundamental problem. The viral spike protein will be isolated, engineered and presented in a way that resembles its disposition on the virus. Its interaction with glycans found in the airways will be studies and the impact on binding of other glycans that are part of the spike protein itself will be analyzed.  Results will define structurally how the virus makes first contact and subsequently invades the airway cells, providing increased knowledge about understanding of SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition to increasing knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 biology, this proposal also supports the training of a post-doctoral fellow, broadening participation in STEM. 

SARS-CoV-2 infects airway epithelial cells by interaction of the viral envelope spike (S) protein with the host cell receptor ACE2. Prior to their integration, viruses first encounter the thick glycocalyx of glycans and glycoconjugates surrounding all cells and in mucus. Most viruses use glycans as attachment factors prior to engagement with their protein receptors. Data show that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to lung epithelial cells depends on cellular heparan sulfate,  and that heparan sulfate may be acting as a coreceptor for ACE2. This project will characterize the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and host cell heparan sulfate by determining how the composition of heparan sulfate affects spike protein binding; by mapping the binding site in spike protein for heparan sulfate; and by examining the impact of altering spike protein glycans in the proximity of the binding site for heparan sulfate. The approach consists of recombinant engineering of the ectodomain of spike protein and the receptor binding domain of ACE2, binding studies with cell lines with altered heparan sulfate, mapping the heparan sulfate binding site by mutation of key amino acid residues, and reconstitution of spike protein into a pseudovirus particle to study its interaction with heparan sulfate and ACE2. This information is urgently needed to understand mechanistically host-virus interaction underlying infection by SARS-CoV-2.

"The goal of this project is to understand the immune response in bats infected experimentally with SARS-CoV-2. Bats are the natural reservoirs of hundreds of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. It is evident that infection of bats with these viruses does them no harm, yet the viruses are capable of replicating and transmitting to other bats. Unfortunately, some of these viruses can spill over into humans and cause disease outbreaks that lead to aggressive inflammatory immune responses that contribute to the disease. It is unclear why these viruses fail to cause disease in bats, nor how the immune systems of bats control the infection without inflammatory disease that is observed in humans. This project will examine the role of the immune system of Jamaican fruit bats experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 in a controlled laboratory setting. The objective of the project is to understand how bat immune systems can limit virus replication and shedding but without disease. This, in turn, may lead to a better understanding of spillover events into humans, permit novel approaches to mitigate those events, and identify new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of human disease. In addition to these therapeutic broader impacts, this project supports the training of one graduate student and the research will be disseminated by public outreach and formal science meetings.

This project will determine the roles of the innate and adaptive immune responses in bats experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2. In humans, there is compelling evidence that much of the COVID-19 pathology is caused by the immune response that leads to pronounced inflammation due to excess cytokine production. In bats naturally infected with coronaviruses, signs of disease are not apparent and experimental challenge with virus leads to innocuous infection. Experimental infection of Jamaican fruit bats show abundant SARS-CoV-2 antigen only in the intestines, particularly in cells of the Peyer’s patches, mononuclear cells of the lamina propria, and crypt cells, yet the intestinal architecture remains nominal. Virtually nothing is known about how bats serve as reservoir hosts of coronaviruses, thus this project will provide the greatest detail yet on how bats control viruses that cause substantial disease burden in humans. The project aims to achieve three objectives with SARS-CoV-2-infected bats: (1) disabling of the type I interferon pathway to determine the role of the innate response during infection; (2) determining the immune cells of Peyer’s patches that respond during infection and which of these cells are infected; and (3) what is the role of T cells in control of the virus by impairing clonal expansion and activation. Collectively, these aims will provide the first experimental manipulation of bat immunity during infection and will define how bat immune responses control infection.

"The overall objective of this research is to develop accurate analytical modeling and simulation for a series of diverse phenomena of fundamental scientific interest, at the edge of various technological developments such as plasma evolution in fusion models, modeling of very cold gases in the intermediate transition to form Bose-Einstein condensation,  hot-electron transport in semiconductor devices, nanostructures for solar generation of hydrogen, and reacting and polyatomic molecular mixtures associated with aerospace dynamics such as those in re-entry problems. Modeling and simulation will be based on data obtained by accurate crystallographic calculations, considering atomistic corrections, and the presence of rough media. Some of the techniques that will be developed are also pertinent to exciting new applications to non-linear dynamics modeling in bio-social sciences, such as modeling of self-organized flows where ""particle"" swarms, like birds or fish, couple to fluid dynamics, emerging consensus in population dynamics, multi-agent information transfer and social information dynamics in Internet, to name a few. Most significantly, this project provides research training opportunities for graduate students that prepare them to a job market that ranges from academia, to national labs, and industry.


These research goals comprise a broad program in the development of analytical and numerical tools associated with statistical transport equations and systems at the core of applied mathematics in probability, statistics applied to chemistry, physics as well as to biological and  social dynamics as well. They concern the modeling of complex interactions systems yielding kinetic frameworks associated to Markovian processes of birth-death dynamics. Such statistical approaches lead to nonlinear integro-differential systems of equations of collisional classical or quantum Boltzmann or Smolukowski type. Computational schemes will be fully designed and analyzed to secure consistency, stability, error estimates control, and convergence rates to equilibrium. Many of these models appear in the collisional theory of semi-classical transport for short- and long-range particle interactions models that describe self-consistent phenomena at nano and meso-scales.  New tools from non-linear analysis as well as new computational strategies will be developed to address long-time behavior, stability, and decay rates to stationary modes, as well as qualitative behavior of numerical solutions and optimal computational strategies.

"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted the problem of rapid transmission of infectious diseases. The COVID-19 virus is transmitted to new hosts through contaminated surfaces as well as through the air. The virus is known to survive in air for hours and on surfaces for days. All current approaches for stopping the transmission, such as masks, frequent hand washing, and social distancing, are insufficient and cause other detriments, and the high numbers of asymptomatic cases and shortage of efficient facemasks are driving the number of infections higher. Current methods for general prevention of transmission of airborne infectious diseases, such as air filtration, use of chemical gases (such as hydrogen peroxide) and the use of ultraviolet radiation, have significant shortcomings and health risks, and they cannot be implemented indoors with people present. This project seeks to utilize the recently developed (by the investigators) nanotechnology-based carrier platform using Engineered Water Nanostructures to inactivate viruses. If this technology is proved successful it can be scaled up and systems can be built and used in various applications. This innovative technology is particularly applicable to closed indoor environments and could help in battling the COVID-19 pandemic as people emerge from their social isolation states and return to  work. As a part of the project, graduate and postdoctoral students will be recruited and trained in interdisciplinary research. The knowledge gained through the project will lead to better control and prevention of the COVID-19 threat. 

In this RAPID project, novel computational methods will be used to design neutralizing disulfide-rich peptides de novo and functionalize them to bind the spike protein of COVID-19 and block it from interacting with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, its endogenous receptor. Then, such peptides, along with other antimicrobials, will be incorporated in a nanocarrier platform using engineered water nanostructures synthesized using combination of electrospray and ionization. A thorough characterization of the physicochemical properties of these water-based nanostructures will be carried out using state of the art analytical methods. The capability of these materials to interact and inactivate the virus on both the air and on surfaces will be assessed using microbiological assays. The interdisciplinary approach of interweaving synthetic biology with nanotechnology would provide a solid tool for tackling COVID-19 on environmental media. Furthermore, the project will lead to the continuation and enhancement of educational activities on emerging aspects of environmental nanotechnology and nano-bio interactions. Results will be disseminated to relevant stakeholders through multifaceted communication activities including publications, conferences, and other out-reach activities. In summary, the proposed nanotechnology-based method has the potential to transform the way we currently control airborne infectious diseases. The social, technological, scientific, public health and economic impact will be significant if such a novel, sustainable, low energy, chemical-free and environmentally friendly method is proven to be effective in the battle against COVID-19.

"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been wreaking havoc around the globe, infecting more than 2 million people with COVID-19 and taking hundreds of thousands of lives to date. One of the major challenges in stopping the pandemic is the development of diagnostic tools for the  rapid detection of the coronavirus at point-of-care in real time. Existing tests for active infections rely on the detection of virus genetic materials with amplification methods that often require long turn-around times in a centralized laboratory setup. The limited and delayed detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections so far has become the bottleneck for stopping the continued community transmission of the virus. In this RAPID application, the investigators will break this bottleneck by developing a novel nanomaterial-based sensor with the capability to detect virus proteins in real time. Validation of the method for detecting actual virus will allow fast screening and isolation of COVID-19 patients, critical for breaking the chain of transmission during current and future pandemics, including potential new waves of the SARS-CoV-2 after the end of the current quarantine. This research project will also provide training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students at the interface of physics, biology, and nanotechnology. 

Existing test for active SARS-CoV-2 infections relies on the detection of virus RNAs by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method, which usually requires long turn-around times in a centralized laboratory setup. In order to break this bottleneck and to stop the pandemic, alternative approaches for fast virus detection are required. The investigators plan to develop aptamer-linked nano-plasmon sensors for real-time detection of virus proteins that are highly abundant in virus-infected cells, including the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid protein. This novel approach combines several lines of technological advancements in nano- and bio-engineering: 1) the localized surface plasmon resonance coupling between two linked gold nanoparticles that is sensitive to their inter-particle distance; 2) single-stranded DNA or RNA aptamers with well-defined secondary and tertiary structures that can recognize specific proteins with strong binding affinities comparable to antibodies; and 3) naturally-occurring riboswitches comprised of an aptamer and a regulatory domains in gene regulation that can change conformations upon binding the target molecule by the aptamer domain. The principal investigator will utilize high-affinity aptamer sequences that have been reported in the literature to specifically recognize the targeted virus proteins and design conformationally “switchable” sequences by mimicking riboswitches and introducing regulatory sequences. Using the computationally designed sequences, the co-principal investigator  will synthesize the nano-plasmon sensors and experimentally validate the functionality in recognizing the targeted virus proteins. Compared to antibodies used for sensor design, nucleotides are much easier and cheaper to synthesize, which is critical for producing testing kits in large quantities. Upon successful completion of the proposed research project, the developed sensors will offer an alternative approach for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 at the point-of-care in real time and can also be used as a scientific tool to study the virus infection mechanism. Moreover, funding of this application will foster student training at the interface of physics, biology, and nanotechnology.

"The specific aim of this effort is to develop an understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by infected persons into their environment throughout the course of their disease. Because COVID-19 can manifest as both severe and mild (even asymptomatic) respiratory disease and can progress from upper to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome throughout infection, the ways in which the disease is transmitted may vary from person to person and change throughout the course of illness. Measurements will be made using a suite of aerosol instrumentation to measure: the size of aerosol particles in the patient environment, size fractionated viral aerosol concentration and aggregated viral aerosol load. The relationships between clinical symptoms, patient viral load, the function of body systems and aerosol shedding of virus will be examined across all individuals. The combined data set will increase knowledge for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. For broader impacts, this study provides knowledge for use of the public health care system to improve safe working conditions for healthcare workers. It will inform best practices for personal protective equipment and help effective implementation of quarantines for infected individuals. For the general public, it will help inform public health organizations on how to advise people on the proper ways to protect themselves from infectious disease. 

This project will combine size-segregated environmental aerosol measurements of SARS-CoV-2 around patients throughout their disease with clinical data of disease state, and renin–angiotensin system (RAS) function. Following initial diagnosis, patients will be monitored routinely throughout illness using an aerosol measurement approach developed based on preliminary sampling activities. Clinical data of viral activity will be obtained from each patient during the course of disease. In addition, patient serum samples will be analyzed for ACE2 and Angiotensin levels to investigate RAS activity as an independent measure of disease state. The relationships between clinical symptoms, patient viral load, RAS system activity and aerosol shedding of virus will be examined across all individuals. The combined data set will increase understanding of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and its transmission over the course of disease progression. This type of longitudinal study of infectious disease transmission that considers both an investigation of modes of spread, coupled with quantifiable disease progression and interaction of the disease with the body’s regulatory systems represents a new model for understanding communicable disease and how to best protect healthcare workers and the general public. As such, the basic knowledge gained here is a broader impact.

"This project’s integrated field and laboratory experiments in Israel and the US will leverage conditions created by a rare storm to establish whether corals show molecular-cellular-physiological effects of aging, and will disentangle the effects of age and size on senescence. Reef building corals are long-lived organisms, with some species living longer than most other organisms on the planet. Aging organisms typically experience a decline in function and an increased death rate, but coral colonies may be exceptions to this aging process because they show an increase in fertility and a decline in mortality with age. Questions remain, however, about whether corals undergo senescence on a functional or cellular level. This project will test whether a coral’s chronological age is linked to telomere length, an established biomarker of aging, and measure effects of age on metabolic rate, growth, and reproduction. The world’s coral reefs are in crisis, and it is predicted that by 2030 reefs will no longer be the rich and highly diverse ecosystem that tens of millions of people rely on for their livelihood. It is therefore imperative to understand age-related physiology in corals so that coral reef ecosystems may be sustainably managed for future generations. Furthermore, because reef restoration efforts often use asexual propagation of small fragments originating from older parent colonies, it is critical to know whether these fragments experience senescence after transplantation. The project will also support a master’s level graduate student who will develop and disseminate public educational materials about coral health and aging. 

Coral colonies, whose polyps bud asexually to produce thousands of clones, have been described as an archetype of negative senescence, although recent evidence suggests that this may not be the case. The rare extratropical cyclone that occurred in March 2020 in the northern Gulf of Aqaba created an extraordinary and time-sensitive opportunity to study aging and senescence because damaged coral colonies are undergoing unusually rapid tissue regeneration, with immediate juxtaposition of old and young polyps. This permits unusual study designs that can address challenges inherent in investigating aging in corals, and in colonial animals generally. Leveraging cutting-edge technology and a complementary, interdisciplinary partnership, the researchers will conduct field studies in the Gulf of Aqaba, precisely controlled mesocosm studies in an automated, 80-aquaria facility in Israel, and advanced molecular biology studies at a leading center for the study of aging in the US. These innovative experiments will: determine whether a coral polyp’s chronological age (1) is linked to telomere length, an established biomarker and central mechanism of cellular aging, and (2) affects the physiological functions of metabolic rate, growth, and reproduction. This project will significantly advance the understanding of key aspects of the biological functioning of reef building coral and of aging across phyla, and may inform the practice of using coral colony fragments in reef restoration efforts. An MS student in the SUNY Stony Brook Marine Conservation and Policy program will travel to Israel to participate in the project and prepare video presentations, blogs, and social media outreach activities for public educational outreach.

"This research will provide increased knowledge of the molecular factors enabling different hosts (especially bats vs. humans) to tolerate the recently emergent SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus. This project will use bat cell line models to investigate differences in cellular proteins which lead to differences in immunity profiles of cells from the different species. The proposed research will identify proteins that are differentially active in different cell line models, and the effects that immune-stimulating factors and SARS-CoV-2 proteins have on host cell protein activities. Results from this research could lead to new insights into why and how certain viruses, in particular SARS-CoV-2, can be tolerated in some species (e.g., bats) but not others (e.g., humans), and could provide information for the emergence of future viruses that can cause pandemics in animal and human populations. The interdisciplinary research team comprises three experienced lead scientists with expertise in complementary areas of research. In addition, the research will provide training to two graduate students who will be able to pursue careers in related areas in academia, the private sector, or government.

The goal of this research is to further knowledge of the molecular processes that underlie species-specific infection of cells with SARS-CoV2. This research will provide insights into transcription factor-based differences between host cells of bat origin, which can tolerate SARS-CoV2 infection in a non-pathogenic manner, vs human and other bat cells that do not show this tolerance. The research involves the collaboration of three PIs with complementary approaches that they will bring to this project. Five major experimental goals will be addressed: 1) characterization of transcriptional and nuclear proteomic profiles that distinguish different bat cell lines; 2) use of a novel protein-binding microarray to profile active transcription factors among these cell lines; 3) characterization of candidate immunity transcription factors, such as NF-κB and IRFs, that are likely different between SARS-CoV2 tolerant and susceptible cell lines; 4) effects of SARS-CoV2 gene products on identified transcription factors in the various cell lines; and 5) potential for replication of novel SARS-CoV2 tracer viruses in different bat cell lines. The proposed research will increase knowledge of SARS-SoV-2 biology. In addition, it investigates the hypothesis that bat cells have evolved molecular immunity pathways that promote or lead towards tolerance (perhaps even symbiosis) of bats with coronaviruses. Such information may lead to the identification of therapeutics for humans and animals against coronaviruses.

"To date the COVID-19 pandemic has infected over 3,000,000 people and resulted in approximately 200,000 deaths worldwide. Viruses rely upon their target cells to provide the proper machinery for their life cycle. Seeing as the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for COVID-19 can infect both bats and humans, this project aims to identify common and unique molecular interactions required for infection in both organisms.  In response to the NSF’s “Dear Colleague Letter” this proposal uses cutting-edge genetic tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 to gain knowledge about cellular factors needed for virus replication.  Throughout the course of this research, genetic tools to identify these interactions in bat cells will be created, providing a resource for any researcher who wishes to study these interactions further. This information will also inform researchers on the specific interactions necessary for coronavirus replication that are common between bat and human cells, providing a framework to fully understand this SARS-CoV-2, in addition to future, undiscovered pathogens. Molecular interactions that are unique to bat and human cell lines provide insight into what interactions are overcome for survival in multiple species and also may provide insight into how an infection can be benign in one species (bats) and cause disease in another (humans). This project will discover new knowledge essential to coronavirus biology, providing the basis for future in depth studies. In addition to increasing knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 biology, this proposal also supports the training of a post-doctoral fellow, broadening participation in STEM.    

The zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the horseshoe bat to humans represents a large question in coronavirus biology. What are the host-virus interactions and cellular pathways in common between bats and humans that allow for efficient replication and virus survival in both species? To answer this question, CRISPR/Cas9 will be used to effectively knockout every gene in both bat and human cell lines to identify genes are required for coronavirus replication in each cell line. While CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful genetic tool, currently these tools are limited to the study of human and murine models, representing a significant challenge for the study of viral replication in bat cell lines. A novel computational pipeline named “MerryCRISPR” will be used to design bat CRISPR reagents and subsequently build the tools necessary for this work. The combination of whole host genome-viral interactions studies studied in parallel in both bat and human cell lines will provide the necessary information to build functional and comprehensive host-coronavirus interaction maps in addition to identifying species-specific interactions.  Collectively, these studies will provide the basis for future interrogation of specific and unique host-coronavirus interactions, informing researchers on the essential biology of coronaviruses.

"Viral infections in the last decades with different strains of the coronavirus (CoV) have led to the SARS-CoV (2003) and MERS (2012) epidemics and to the most recent COVID-19 pandemic (2019). At this point, no vaccine or effective antiviral drug is commercially available for these human pathogens. CoVs are built out of four major structural proteins; the nucleocapsid (N) protein engulfing the viral RNA, the spike (S) protein, the membrane (M) protein and the envelope (E) protein. Presently, academic and pharmaceutical efforts are mainly focused on the S-protein which is involved in the entry of the virus into the host cell,  whereas the M- and E-proteins are less well studied but are shown to be involved in viral replication. This project will study the E-protein from different CoV strains to better understand its function.  This project will improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, and this understanding is knowledge necessary to identify new therapeutics to control this current COVI-19 pandemic. In addition to increasing knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 biology, this project also supports the training of a post-doctoral fellow, broadening participation in STEM. 

This project will study the E-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (CoVs) to understand the role of this ion channel in host-virion interaction. A multi-level approach will be used to gain comprehensive understanding on effects of the post-translational modifications and sequence variability of various E-proteins from different CoV strains. Patterns in the post-translational modification of E-proteins will be identified to determine whether these modifications affect the functionality of the E-protein in model membranes. Using model membranes allows for control of key-features in the membrane environment, namely charge of lipid head-groups and saturation of fatty acids creating a microdomain or non-microdomain environment. The throughput of these recordings will be increased by using our unique abilities to combine modern electronics and membrane biophysics. E-proteins from different CoV strains will be used to identify the impact on the development of productive or non-productive infections in a host-like environment.  The current COVID-19 public health emergency makes understanding this new pathogen of urgent importance. Little is known about this novel CoV and its relationship to other CoV virions. Understanding better the exact role that the E-protein plays in the host-virion interaction will be very helpful in devising new therapeutics.

"Biofilms are aggregates of bacteria.  Biofilms play important roles in ecological, industrial, and biomedical processes of national relevance. For example, they are associated with biofouling, where microorganisms attach to surfaces and reduce the performance of machines. In medical fields, biofilms play a key role in the development of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Biofilms often form in wet environments under fluid flow. Although a large body of knowledge on biofilm formation exists, little is known about how initial single- and multi-cell interactions and fluid flow influence the growth and final structure of biofilms. This project will analyze the fundamental processes that govern cell interactions within a biofilm in fluid flow environments. The results will improve understanding of the developmental stages of microbial biofilm formation by investigating the bacteria cell responses under flow conditions. This may ultimately lead to a way to control biofilm evolution.  These outcomes could also help with novel diagnosis and treatment methods for problems caused by biofilms. This project is a collaboration between researchers at two two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and one national lab.  The institutions are Howard University, Florida A&M University, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The project supports the interdisciplinary training of underrepresented groups.  Undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) will participate at their respective institutions.   
 
Biofilms constitute an inherent part of the natural life cycle of most microorganisms, and most bacterial biofilms develop under hydrodynamic stress. The hypothesis is that the cost of growing and evolving in hydrodynamic conditions for these banks of bacteria has a net effect of initiating and promoting intrinsic physical, physiological, and kinetic properties that may contribute to biofilm resistance and resilience. This project presents a novel strategy to investigate the impact of hydrodynamics that occurs within bacterial communities using live and model bacteria systems and high-resolution fluorescent velocimetry. This research integrates theoretical and experimental work with the following objectives: (1) Investigate the various hydrodynamic conditions at the substratum boundary and their effect on the adhesion kinetics and spatial distribution of bacterial cells and (2) Determine the impact of hydrodynamic forces on the intercellular and interspecies interactions during biofilm evolution, and (3) Develop a working model for predicting the kinetics of recruitment and detachment of bacteria to and from biofilms under hydrodynamic milieus.

"Calcification of soft tissues (e.g. arteries) is a hallmark of several cardiovascular diseases like aortic aneurysms and atherosclerosis. Calcific deposits lead to adverse consequences such as stiffening of arteries and disruption of normal blood flow, often leading to morbidity and mortality. The goal of this project is to understand where calcific deposits are formed in soft tissues. In particular, the investigators will examine how collagen fibrils (present in the extracellular matrix surrounding the cells in the arterial wall) can facilitate pathological calcification. The insights gained will advance our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing soft-tissue calcification especially in its early stages. This can help improve cardiovascular outcomes by designing new strategies for early diagnosis and treatment and aid biomaterials development for cardiovascular bioprostheses. In addition to advancing the field of extracellular matrix and vascular biology, the project will help train the next generation of scientists and engineers by providing graduate and undergraduate student(s) with multidisciplinary hands-on research experiences and under-privileged K-8 students with enrichment activities. Furthermore, new education materials and microscopy approaches will be developed to enhance education and research infrastructure for the broader scientific community.

The goal of this project is to understand the role of the collagen fibril in mediating vascular calcification.  While it is accepted that pathological calcification is mediated by phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells into a ‘bone-like’ osteogenic phenotype, there is also evidence indicating that in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), a subpopulation of collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix undergoes a structural change as compared to the native (normal) fibrils. The project’s overall hypothesis is that structurally altered (abnormal) collagen fibrils in AAA serve as the major substrates for calcific deposits due to perturbations in their surface-charge distribution. To test this hypothesis, studies will be conducted at the single fibril level on human AAA tissue, beginning with mapping the micro and macro-calcifications in the excised AAA tissue using micro-computed tomography. The Research Plan is organized under two aims.  The FIRST Aim is to test the hypothesis that structurally altered collagen fibrils in AAA are “hot-spots” for negative charges in the ECM.  Surface potential and surface charge mapping of collagen fibrils in ambient air will be accomplished using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), a technique available on most commercial AFMs (Atomic Force Microscopes) that has been used for mapping surface potential and surface charge on metals and semiconductors, but is being uniquely applied in this project to the analysis of normal and abnormal fibrils in situ in tissue sections.  Surface charge distribution of collagen fibrils in a fluid environment will be measured using another AFM based approach based on recording force-distance curves, which can map both surface charge and sample topography at high resolution in physiologically relevant fluid environments (e.g. different salt concentrations).  The SECOND AIM is to test the hypothesis that both natural as well as bio-mimetically induced calcific deposits in AAA are localized on structurally altered fibrils. A biomimetic approach will be used to determine if abnormal fibrils can be a cause as well as an effect of vascular calcification. Biomimetic mineralization will be induced in a cell free manner (in mineral-poor regions) using ionic solutions (e.g. dental fluid) that mimic the native ion concentrations in plasma without its biological components and by incubating extracellular vesicles (EV) isolated from cultured cells with decellularized AAA tissue.  Spatial distribution and characterization of calcific deposits will be determined using analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) approaches to characterize the size, composition and location of minerals with respect to the collagen fibril at the ultrastructural level.  Abnormal fibrils are expected to be more prone to calcific deposits as compared to normal fibrils both with respect to percent of fibrils mineralized as well as number and size of calcific deposits present per fibril, and a similar trend is expected to be observed for biomimetic and naturally induced calcific deposits.

"COVID-19 recently emerged as a worldwide pandemic, causing untold human suffering and severe economic disruptions. How individual immune systems respond to a novel coronavirus, for example, why some individuals clear infection efficiently while others do not is not known. This project seeks to understand how immune cells, specifically T cells, find cells infected with virus that are dispersed in the lung. It will address how spatial distributions of infected cells and movement patterns of T cells through complex lung structures determine the course of infection. The project will develop the Spatial Immunological Model of Coronavirus (SIM-Cov), a simulation model for studying these effects and improving understanding of how the immune system controls infection by coronaviruses. The model will take computed tomography (CT) scans of an infected human lung as input, as well as biological data on how T cells interact with the virus and infected lung cells. The model will predict the course of infection in the form of visually intuitive movies showing how the infection progresses through time in different individuals. By modeling variability in individuals’ infectious rates over time, SIM-Cov will improve our understanding of why the severity of COVID-19 varies so much among individuals. The model and movies will be publicly accessible, and incorporated into educational materials for high school and college students. The project will also train two graduate and one undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research.

One gap in understanding infection dynamics of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is why the severity of infection varies so much among individuals. This project addresses that gap by incorporating the role played by spatial-temporal dynamics in within-host infections and immune control, particularly the role of T cells which are required for viral clearance. Most quantitative models of viral infection use differential equations or stochastic models and do not account for the spatial distribution of infected cells or T cell movement patterns. The project addresses this gap by developing a three-dimensional spatial model of the whole lung (SIM-Cov) that tests how spatial interactions between T cells and virus affect viral growth, load and clearance within the lungs. Ultimately, these within-host factors contribute to the rate of clearance within a single host and transmission between hosts. SIM-Cov will be parameterized and validated with empirical imaging data (CT scans of SARS-infected patients) and the emerging literature on SARS-CoV-2 and immune responses. SIM-Cov will model the lung microenvironment, including vasculature and epithelium surrounding the airways and alveolar spaces, the spatial and temporal spread of virus throughout the lung, and the spatial arrangement and movement of T cells. The project will have broad-ranging impacts for understanding coronavirus infection dynamics and educational impacts through dissemination of the model and movies produced in the project, as well as the engagement of three students in interdisciplinary research.

"In order to diversify North Dakota’s economy beyond agriculture and energy, ND-ACES will generate new knowledge and increase jurisdictional competitiveness in bioscience areas, particularly those related to cancer therapies.  A key focus is the improved understanding of the region of contact, or biointerface, between a biological tissue and a biomaterial.  Scaffold biomaterials will be designed that stimulate the growth of new tissue at the biointerface.  ND-ACES will optimize the design of biointerfaces through a collaboration among multiple fields of sciences and engineering, including materials science, cell biology and biochemistry, medicine, and computational modeling. Computational tools will allow the modeling of the 3D cancerous tumor environment and resulting cellular responses.  These studies will address the urgent need to increase the understanding of interactions between cells and surfaces in the context of tumor growth, metastasis, and response to therapies.  ND-ACES will enhance research resources and develop the computationally skilled workforce in North Dakota.  During the five years of this project, a diverse group of researchers and students from ten academic institutions in North Dakota, including four tribal colleges, three primarily undergraduate institutions, and one master’s university, will participate in the research and educational activities. This project will forge partnerships with industries and other stakeholders and prepare a well-trained workforce capable of meeting the needs of bioscience in North Dakota and beyond.

The North Dakota EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-1 project, ND-ACES, will use computational modeling to develop improved interdisciplinary understanding of biological and engineered materials biointerfaces; expand expertise in novel cellular growth and analysis paradigms for mimicking the in vivo environment of cancerous tumors; catalyze research/computing capabilities; support the translation of research into use through products, partnerships, and collaborations with various stakeholders; and inform North Dakota's citizens.  ND-ACES builds research capacity to better understand design rules that govern in vitro biointerfaces and influence in vivo decisions surrounding the understanding of biochemistry and the cell biology of cancer cells and tumors.  Computationally created design rules can enhance predictability of cellular responses to material surface characteristics and provide fundamental information to address many bioscience challenges. Thus, the integration of computational modeling as a prominent research tool allows for more extensive testing than possible with trial-and-error methods.   ND-ACES efforts incorporate both faculty and students at all ten participating institutions in collaborative research, early career development, education enhancement, and outreach to increase the abilities of early career faculty, increase advanced scientific computing capabilities, and broaden the participation and number of STEM undergraduate and graduate students.

"Inflammation is a characteristic feature of many diseases including arteriosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and cancer.  The development of probes to track inflammation could provide information towards the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides high resolution and deep tissue images, which in conjunction with MRI probes, may enable mapping of inflammation in disease states.  In this project, Dr. Morrow is developing new MRI probes that demonstrate a change in signal in the presence of certain molecules that are produced by the immune defense system of the body during inflammation. These MRI probes contain cobalt or iron switches that are part of small molecules or lipid nanoparticles.  This project involves the preparation of several new cobalt or iron containing molecules and their study in solution and in animal models of inflammation.  Dr. Morrow of the University at Buffalo, the State University of New York is actively engaged in outreach activities that build upon her research to promote engagement of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. These activities, which include summer research internships for middle school and high school teachers in Dr. Morrow’s laboratory, are directed at improving education of K-12 students and encouraging their interest in STEM careers. 

With funding from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-B program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Morrow of the University at Buffalo, the State University of New York is developing transition metal complexes as MRI contrast agents that respond to cellular redox imbalances attributed to inflammation. Inflammation that is associated with the defensive immune response is a characteristic of many diseases and injuries including arteriosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and cancer.  For example, atherosclerotic lesions contain high levels of perioxidase activity.  Dr. Morrow is synthesizing new Co(II) and Fe(II)/Fe(III) complexes as MRI contrast agents that are responsive to inflammation.  Small molecule coordination complexes of Fe(II) are activated under these oxidizing conditions through the formation of high spin Fe(III) complexes that are relaxivity contrast agents.  Liposome systems loaded with Co(II) or Fe(II) show a shift in the position of the signal upon change in redox environment.  MRI studies are carried out both in solution and in mice.  Dr. Morrow is actively engaged in STEM outreach programs focused on summer research experiences and collaborative projects for middle and high school teachers and for undergraduates to improve education in the STEM fields, in support of broader impacts of the project.

This phenomenon, known as chromatic acclimation, involves a few genes that allow these microbes to incorporate different pigments depending on the available color of light filtering through the ocean.  The team will characterize the structures and functions of the proteins encoded by these genes. Findings of this research will help predict how marine Synechococcus and the food chain are affected by changes in the ocean. These studies promise to expand the repertoire of fluorescent bio-imaging probes for biotechnology.  This research will train 4 graduate students, 6-8 undergraduate students, 6 high school teachers, and 3-6 high school students in genetics, biochemistry and structural biology. Outreach activities include camps which will increase the persistence and diversity of STEM majors, high school teacher training modules, and promotion of the public’s awareness of science.

Marine Synechococcus achieve extensive pigment diversity via post-translational modifications of phycobiliproteins that constitute the photosynthetic antennae called phycobilisomes. Phycobiliprotein biogenesis involves attachment of chemically distinct bilin pigments to these proteins via enzymatic reactions catalyzed by bilin lyases. Bilin lyase-isomerases attach a green-absorbing bilin and isomerize it to a blue-absorbing bilin.  These enzymes play a key role in Type IV Chromatic Acclimation (CA4), in which the cells change color as a result of massive restructuring of their phycobilisomes under blue or green light. The ability to perform CA4 is conferred by a small genomic island composed of 4-5 genes, including a bilin lyase. However, the mechanism by which Synechococcus utilizes different bilin lyases and lyase-isomerases to achieve their pigment diversity remains elusive. This research integrates biochemistry, molecular genetics and structural biology to study a group of uncharacterized bilin lyases involved in CA4. The project aims are: (1) to identify and characterize novel lyases and lyase-isomerases responsible for key changes in bilin content that occur during CA4; (2) to determine the functional role of Unk10, a novel protein encoded in the CA4 genomic island, which is hypothesized to influence chromophorylation at those bilin sites involved in CA4; (3) to combine crystallography and mutagenesis to establish the reaction mechanism and structural basis that distinguishes between lyase and lyase-isomerase functions.

"Nontechnical Summary
Materials found throughout nature, including those which compose the cells and tissues of the body, have structures that often exist transiently and are dependent on the presence of certain stimuli. Recreating the transient, stimuli-dependent states of natural materials with synthetic constructs thus offers an approach to more precisely engineer replicates of natural materials in pursuit of more life-like materials. This CAREER award seeks to establish new routes to the creation of transient materials which will inform the future design of functional constructs and therapeutic devices. Specifically, materials for which formation and stability is dictated by the presence of a continuously consumed fuel source are envisioned, wherein the lifetime of the material is tunable through altering the dosage of applied fuel or changing the environmental conditions to which the material is exposed. Similarly, toward harnessing light as a fuel, other materials are envisioned which convert applied light into a directive cue driving transient material formation with tunable lifetime. Accessing transient states in soft materials, by way of chemical fuels or by using light, points to a new direction in the design of soft materials with enhanced functionality rooted in their nature-mimetic transient states, with uses in advancing a number of material applications. Integrated within this convergent research program is an ongoing effort to build and expand laboratory and classroom training in the area of molecular engineering, and an overarching goal to advance the practice of scientific communication through research, mentorship, community outreach, and experiential training for graduate trainees in the chemical and materials sciences.

Technical Summary
Nature achieves remarkable function from materials which exist in dissipative non-equilibrium states; one must look no further than the cell structure and motility which arises from ATP-fueled non-equilibrium assembly of its actin cytoskeleton. Accordingly, this CAREER award integrates research and training in an effort to create bio-inspired materials with fuel-dependent formation and transient stability, and which subsequently dissipate when fuel is limited. Recreating the dissipative non-equilibrium states of natural materials with synthetic analogues has captivated many in recent years. While efforts have focused almost exclusively on fuel-dependent assembly of small molecules, a new paradigm is described here for fuel-dependent non-equilibrium formation of host–guest supramolecular hydrogels. This outcome will be achieved through recognition motifs which are dependent on a continuous supply of a consumable chemical fuel source, or by using light-responsive motifs to actuate a light stimulus into altered affinity and/or dynamics of the motif. When the specific chemical or light fuel sources are limited, these materials will exist transiently and dissipate to their designed equilibrium state of a sol or weak gel. More broadly, host–guest supramolecular recognition affords a useful class of soft materials which have properties directly attributed to the dynamic nature of their crosslinking interactions. These materials have thus exhibited a variety of useful emergent properties in their application as new biomaterials and therapeutic delivery devices, and also afford features desirable for a number of industrial applications. The ability to further integrate transient and fuel-dependent formation of this class of materials seeks increased biomimetic function to further expand on their possible uses. This research plan is placed within a multidisciplinary training environment tailored to train leaders in the convergent discipline of molecular engineering, which is further augmented by classroom instruction. In addition, training aimed at improving scientific communication in the chemical and materials sciences seeks to achieve improved public engagement conveying the importance of scientific research.

"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY
This research program contributes to innovations in nanomaterials that are useful in biomedical therapies, sensing, and catalysis. Nanoclusters that consist of fewer than ~200 metallic atoms are of interest due to their luminescence in near-infrared light, bio-compatibility and ultra-small size. The relationship between the structure and optical properties of these nanoclusters remains unclear, which prevents the design of nanoclusters with optimized performance. This program uses pressure to modify the structure of nanoclusters, in order to learn about the electronic transitions that are responsible for light absorption and luminescence, as well as the stability of nanoclusters under external stimulus. This research is closely tied to our educational plans through the training of postdocs and graduate students, by supporting underrepresented groups at the K-12 and college level in science and technology, and by supporting science teachers in the community. In addition, modules that explain the influence of mechanics on optical behavior will be incorporated into undergraduate courses during this program.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY
The proposed research is concerned with characterizing the properties of atomically precise clusters composed of gold or silver plus ligands using diamond anvil cell techniques to apply high pressure, and with optical measurements (both absorption and emission) to study excited states.  The experiments will be modeled using electronic structure theory, including ground state calculations to determine structures, and excited state studies to determine optical properties, and including methods development based on second linear response theory and domain-separated density functional theory.  The research is aimed at identifying optical properties such as plasmon to exciton transitions, and an increase in luminescence efficiency with increasing pressure; both properties are of interest to using the clusters in practical applications.  The research includes three research objectives: (1) study of energy transfer responsible for broad absorption & near-infrared luminescence of the cluster material under pressure, (2) determine the source of anomalous multiple emissions of the nanoclusters, and (3) studies of 2-3 nm nanoclusters to characterize the transition from plasmonic to excitonic states.

"Nontechnical Summary
Whether for constructing complex biological devices like enzymes or for building sophisticated materials with advanced physical properties like skeletal muscles, proteins have been nature’s premier building blocks throughout the course of evolution. Yet, the ability of laboratory scientists to control the self-assembly of proteins or to use them as synthetic building blocks to generate new functions has been severely limited. The overarching goal of the proposed research program is to overcome this limitation by developing new protein design tools based on metal coordination chemistry and DNA nanotechnology. In one project goal, the PI’s group will construct complex, cage-like protein architectures which can ultimately be used to encapsulate and release molecular cargo in a stimuli-dependent fashion. In a second project goal, they will exploit the programmability of DNA self-assembly to generate multicomponent protein architectures and elucidate the complex energy landscape of protein-DNA interactions. In terms of the broader impacts, the proposed effort will not only provide fundamental insights into biological self-assembly processes, but also lend access to novel protein-based functionalities and materials with potential applications in bio/nano-technology and basic sciences (e.g., separations, catalysis, delivery, sensing, X-ray or electron-diffraction-based structure determination). Due to its highly interdisciplinary nature, this project will provide an expansive training ground for graduate, undergraduate, and high school researchers, and help them tackle complex scientific problems later in their careers. As a new educational activity, the PI’s lab will start hosting STEM activities designed for Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps from San Diego-area high schools. These activities collectively will enhance the students’ understanding of proteins as biomolecules and their self-assembly/crystallization as well as their novel uses as building blocks for novel catalysts and materials. Importantly, the students will be exposed to daily activities that are taking place in a research laboratory. 

Technical Summary

While natural evolution has produced remarkable protein-based machines and materials over the course of billions of years, it has only explored an infinitesimally small fraction of the design/self-assembly space that could be achieved with the available protein folds. Therefore, it would be highly desirable to have the ability to craft ordered protein assemblies from scratch using building blocks of choice, which would greatly broaden the structural and functional scope of naturally existing protein assemblies and bioinspired materials. Previous findings from the PI’s indicate that the tools and principles of supramolecular/inorganic/polymer chemistry and protein engineering can be combined in new ways to address outstanding issues in protein self-assembly and to create novel biomaterials. In the proposed research, these efforts will be expanded under two Objectives. Under Objective 1, the PI’s group will expand their inorganic chemical toolkit through the use of unnatural metal chelating functionalities and combine them with computational design to access complex, stimuli-responsive polyhedral architectures that were previously out of reach. Objective 2 will exploit the programmability of DNA self-assembly to generate heteromeric/multicomponent protein architectures and to better understand the complex energy landscape of protein-DNA co-assembly. The Objectives will take advantage of two protein building blocks (cytochrome cb562 and Rop) to access a multitude of oligomeric and polymeric protein assemblies in a modular fashion, probe their structures and structural dynamics using state-of-the-art tools (e.g., cryoEM, X-ray diffraction and scattering), and examine their emergent functions (e.g., nucleic acid encapsulation).

"Personal protective equipment (PPE), such as face masks, gloves and surgical gowns, forms the primary barrier for medical, healthcare and laboratory workers for protection against contact with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The virus lives on the surface of currently available PPE materials for many days. Recent evidence suggests that copper or copper zinc oxide composites with antimicrobial activity may inactivate virus. However, the mechanism for this is poorly understood at present. This project will test the hypothesis that PPE surfaces coated with copper or zinc oxide nanoparticles (NANO-PPE) will cause denaturation and degradation of viral biomolecules, thus leading to viral inactivation. The project sheds new insight into hybrid materials containing these biotic metals on the PPE surface, especially characterizing their interactions to biomaterials such as lipid, protein or RNA and the impact on structure-function. The RAPID project draws on several complementary areas of technology including, nanomaterial surface chemistry and processes, biophysics, biochemistry, and virology. This provides a unique interdisciplinary training environment for a diverse group of post-graduate, graduate and undergraduate students to engage in this cutting-edge research. Societal impact is that NANO-PPE stands to inactivate virus on contact, better protecting personnel from viral infection and thus limiting community spread, and long-term may help protect against other healthcare associated infections and drug resistant bacteria. This project is jointly funded by the  Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET)  Division and  the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

The primary objective of this RAPID project is to gain a more fundamental understanding of nanoscale interactions of viral or viral-mimetic lipid, protein and RNA to PPE materials surface-coated with copper or copper/zinc oxide composites. The goals of the project are; 1) to fabricate PPE materials coated with copper and/or zinc oxide nanoparticles, mixtures and composites, 2) to characterize their nano-bio interactions and quantify the biomolecular denaturation and degradation caused by the nanoscale interaction, and 3) to place surrogate respiratory virus in contact with NANO-PPE and determine functional impact on viral titer and infectivity. Standard industrial scale processes such as electrospinning and deep coating will be used to coat the surface of PPE (face-mask, nitrile glove and surgical gown) with copper and zinc oxide nanoparticles. Surface interactions with the viral lipid, protein and RNA will be investigated by transmission electron microscopy, FT-IR, Raman/Photoluminescence, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  Biomolecular denaturation and degradation will be quantified by 2-dimensional fluorescence difference spectroscopy, circular dichroism, gel electrophoresis, tryptic digestion and liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy. Finally, viral titer and RT-PCR will be used to quantify impact of nanoscale interaction on biological activity.   Overall, the experiments will probe structure-functional impact of nanoscale interaction of virus and its inhibition by coming into contact with NANO-PPE. The project  will be integrated into a graduate class in Nanomedicine within a unit on nanoscale interactions and characterization methods and into the PI and co-PIs research programs involving undergraduate, masters, PhD and post-doctoral students. Products of this research will be translated to a corporate partner for rapid manufacturing and introduction into the healthcare and laboratory supply chain.  This project is jointly funded by the  Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET)  Division and  the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"Professor Paul S. Weiss of the University of California, Los Angeles is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program of the Division of Chemistry to study charge transport through organic chiral (e.g., helical) molecules and assemblies. The chiral molecules and molecular assemblies are placed on magnetic surfaces and nanostructures. A number of versatile spectroscopic and microscopic measurements and imaging techniques are used to probe the ultrafast charge transfer movements through  molecules and assemblies that are attached to surfaces. The research results may advance the general fields of spintronics and magnetism. Better understanding of these organic assemblies paves the way for their use as complements or replacements for current spintronic devices, such as computer logic and memory with low power and high density. In the course of conducting the project, students are trained in a multidisciplinary environment, including international collaboration. In addition, Professor Weiss gives popular talks through different venues, such as National Public Radio (NPR) and courses for high school students and teachers. 

The project aims to elucidate the molecular, substrate, and interfacial properties that contribute to spin-selective charge transport in chiral molecular assemblies adsorbed on metal and semiconducting surfaces. The ultimate goal is to understand the processes involved and to assess the future practicality of implementing chiral organic assemblies as spin filters within device architectures. First, the mechanistic role of molecular spin-orbit coupling on electron spin filtering by DNA monolayers are determined. Heavy metal ions are incorporated within DNA molecules to manipulate and to enhance helix-induced spin-orbit-coupling. Monolayers of DNA are formed on ferromagnetic substrates and on the surfaces of GaN Hall effect devices, and the effects of mercuration are probed using spin-dependent electrochemistry, photoelectron spectroscopy, and Hall voltage measurements. Second, the coupling between ferromagnetic substrates and quantum dots tethered via chiral ligands is investigated. The dependence of photoluminescence lifetime of the chiral molecule-functionalized quantum dots are measured as a function of handedness and substrate magnetization using fluorescence lifetime imaging of patterned arrays of chiral quantum dots. The chiral signature, composition, and geometry of the quantum dots, as well as the lengths of tethering molecules (and thus the electronic coupling to the substrate) are tested. Finally, ultrafast charge transfer measurements between carboranethiolate enantiomers and magnetized substrates using core-hole clock spectroscopy are conducted.

"The ""Biofilm Resource and Information Database (BRaID)"" project is a collaboration between the Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE) at Montana State University, Bozeman, MT and the Gianforte School of Computing at MSU and the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR), Santa Fe, NM. Biofilms are microbial communities that have important impacts on water quality, food production, energy-making processes, and various aspects of human and animal health. BRaID serves as a community resource, containing both data and the metadata (where or how data was collected, processed, and interpreted).  Some examples of metadata include: a geographical location, such as the Bozeman Water Reclamation Facility; microenvironments such as water chemistry; environmental factors such as changes in temperature, perturbations such as adding corrosion inhibitors; and interventions such as antibiotic treatments. BRaID has utility to a broad range of stakeholders in basic and applied research, as such it is expected to enhance the competitiveness of US industry, basic research, and defense, as well as assist with advancements in human health, environmental health, and energy production. Outreach activities will include (1) dissemination of research outcomes to local community members and industry stakeholders at conferences and legislator engagements; (2) involvement of underrepresented Native American students from high schools and tribal colleges in summer research activities as well as undergraduate researchers at MSU-Bozeman; and (3) educational activities in undergraduate and graduate courses at MSU, as well as summer internship, outreach and training activities at the NCGR.

Awareness of the importance of microbial biofilms - microorganisms growing as aggregates attached to surfaces, interfaces, or each other - has exploded in the past decade. Diverse microbial communities grow as biofilms in such settings as dental plaque, heart valves, natural watercourses, wastewater treatment processes, cooling systems, oil and gas pipelines, and persistent infections. Biofilms can have significant impacts on human health, industrial productivity, and natural resources, spanning natural, engineered, and medical systems. Despite the importance of biofilms, there is no public web portal and database dedicated to storage, analysis, and communication of biofilm-specific data. Part of the reason for this is the sheer breadth of data types used to describe biofilms, including nucleotide sequences, images, video, chemistry (water, surface, and extracellular polymer matrix), remediation history, clinical outcomes, and geospatial data. BRaID will complement existing microbial databases by developing a data representation paradigm that solves the problems posed by the challenge arising from the unique combination of data, and will implement new metrics and algorithms for the formal description and analysis of biofilms data. This project aims to provide the premier resource that offers users the ability to ask complex questions (including those currently impossible to answer), permitting quantitative comparisons among biofilms, supporting remediation efforts, and enabling predictions about outcomes.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore needs for measuring pollutants in soils and sediments through the development of passive sampling technology as a routine monitoring tool. Passive samplers provide accurate information about exposures and risks for human and ecological health at contaminated sediment sites. Convenient and cost-effective passive sampling methods can improve the output of commercial laboratories and support better consistency, efficiency, and frequency of monitoring programs at contaminated sites. Routine application of passive sampling via standardized exposure methods will reduce the time and costs of sediment management by implementing remediation approaches addressing true risks to aquatic ecosystems. Passive samplers can be used for assessing the progress of cleanup projects by helping to detect emerging environmental issues, resulting in overall improvement in the quality of life.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of polymeric passive samplers as monitoring tools that provide information about dissolved concentrations of contaminants in the water and sediment at polluted sites. The passive sampling technique provides accurate measurements of contaminants at ultra-low levels undetectable using traditional analytical methods. Passive samplers mimic pollutant accumulation in aquatic organisms, resulting in a much better representation of ecological and human health risks compared to traditional methods.  Polymeric passive samplers are relatively simple to use and can be inserted into contaminated media in the field or in the laboratory. During sampler deployment, pollutants accumulate in the polymer, providing a measurable dissolved concentration without the need for water or sediment sample collection.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to enable the nanoscale chemical imaging technology from strictly research labs to industrial in-line processes. Nanoscience and nanotechnology have revolutionized a variety of markets since their inception. Nonetheless, large-scale manufacturing of nanomaterials has lagged, partly because of the inability to efficiently qualify and control nanoscale production methods. The proposed project will develop a user-friendly, practical, and potentially portable chemical imaging system. This technology will revolutionize nanotechnology by improving quality control of future production methods and enabling new applications, ranging from data storage and optical communication to cancer detection. The probe microscope market accounts for approximately 4% of the $5.3 billion microscopy market and has been limited by measurement complexity and lack of chemical sensitivity. The proposed technology would remove these limitations, creating an opportunity for growth within the microscopy market space.

The proposed project is to prototype the transformative nanoscale chemical imaging microscopy by integrating the invented plasmonic fiber probes with commercial probe microscopes. Nanoscale chemical imaging had demonstrated potential for use in an array of applications including material science, bio-sensing, optoelectronics, and catalysis. However, due to the complex operating challenges including optical alignment times, low tip reliability, low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), and highly skilled technician requirements, there has been limited commercial application. This PFI-TT project will undertake prototyping activities of a fiber tip-enhanced Raman spectroscope (F-TERS), an optical fiber probe-based nanoscale chemical imaging microscopy designed to overcome these challenges while still providing the chemical composition and nanoscale morphology imaging of a sample surface. In addition, F-TERS also provides the potential for significantly improved SNR, enabling additional applications. This will be accomplished by 1) overcoming the identified hurdles of demonstrating F-TERS functionality with atomic force microscope (AFM), and 2) quantifying F-TERS performance in real-world environments with independent operators.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a user-friendly and scalable infection control surveillance software platform using advanced biotech and data analytics for monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for rapid testing, analysis, and tracking. The innovation provides access to next-generation sequence technologies to healthcare facilities, as well as a centralized system to integrate and share hospital-level data with microbial information to be shared on any geographic scale. The platform automates the analysis of bacterial and viral data, delivering simplified and clinically relevant results via interactive web interfaces. The proposed technology offers important data to clinicians and other experts. 

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to generate the largest collection of SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes with matched respiratory microbiomes for clinicians to rapidly test medical hypotheses for diagnostic and prescriptive use. Our project has three major objectives: 1) incorporate an automated analytical pipeline to process whole genomes of infecting strains of SARS-CoV-2; 2) integrate viral genomes with patient microbiomes and clinical records, and; 3) deliver clear, easy-to-interpret results via an interactive web interface. The infection control cloud-based software platform solution enables “precision epidemiology” integrating pathogen genomics with clinical and patient demographics to improve patient outcomes and enhance the capability of the health system for infection control and surveillance.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted universities worldwide to abruptly shift to remote learning. This coincides with a critical social change as students are urged to leave campus, “social distance,” and shelter-in-place; practices that will disrupt social network functioning and could lead to feelings of isolation, reduced motivation, and poorer learning outcomes. Worse, the social and academic consequences could be more severe for less academically prepared students (e.g., underrepresented minorities, first-generation college, low socioeconomic status) and first year students in particular, who are still adjusting to college life (e.g., building social networks, learning university culture). Given the uncertainty of the current situation, it is critical to understand how the pandemic and the ""social distance"" triggered by it may influence student social networks and whether disparities in social and academic outcomes result.  This RAPID was submitted in response to the NSF Dear Colleague letter related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This award is made by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. 

The goal of this RAPID research project is to investigate how the shift to remote learning triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting social networks, psycho-social adjustment, and academic outcomes for first-year STEM majors, and whether disparities emerge for students from subgroups historically more likely to leave STEM. The research will examine these potential impacts, and how risks might be offset by an existing intervention at the University of California Irvine (UCI) -- the Enhanced Academic Success Experience (EASE) program. EASE is a learning community designed to improve academic outcomes for under-prepared students, with one-third of the approximately 1,000 first-year majors in the School of Biological Sciences (Bio Sci) participating each year. To date, research on the intervention has provided strong causal evidence that EASE has successfully increased motivation, engagement, and belongingness, with stronger effects for groups typically underrepresented within STEM. As part of the intervention, researchers have gathered longitudinal network data that are unique in both scale (~1,000 students/year within a major) and coverage (85-96% response rate). This research will characterize changes in friendship and study networks, psycho-social adjustment, and academic outcomes that result from the unprecedented shift to remote organizational activities. The new data collection and analysis will explore whether the shift to remote learning creates disparities in these important outcomes for subgroups of STEM students and whether the learning community provided by EASE may mitigate these effects. Through supplementary data collection, the study will consider how student networks have adapted to the organizational shift to remote learning and where students are obtaining the kinds of emotional and instrumental support they need. Mediation analysis will offer insight into which network characteristics explain psycho-social and academic consequences of the shift to remote learning. More generally, the unique data will enable assessment of how social networks adapt to societal-level disruption caused by the pandemic, and how well-implemented institutional support may offset the anticipated risks associated with the pandemic.

"The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a global threat to worldwide economies and public health due to its highly contagious nature and rapid spread. To develop optimal strategies for containment and treatment of the coronavirus epidemic, it is critical to understand the cell types and biological mechanisms that mediate viral entry and propagation across the human population. Recent advancements in single-cell technologies now make it possible to measure the expression of genes at a cell-type resolution. This project aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the cell types used by SARS-CoV-2 for viral entry across the nasal airways, lung, and gut tissue and to understand physiological basis of how age, gender, and smoking history may predispose healthy individuals to infection. Identification of cells containing the two proteins known to mediate viral entry [the receptor protein angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2)] will elucidate the gene expression programs and signaling pathways associated with cells used by the novel coronavirus for host entry. Analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) data from the lung will identify the cell-type specific transcription factors and regulatory regions associated with these gene expression programs. This improved understanding of the signaling pathways, gene expression programs, and regulatory mechanisms of coronavirus infection of cells may lead to novel, patient- and region-specific therapeutic targets to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The single-cell data will be made available for download, analysis, and visualization, thus providing a valuable resource to the scientific community.In addition to dissemination of the findings and contributing to potential treatment strategies for the control of coronavirus infection, the project will support the training and professional development of a data scientist and of a computational research associate.

The catastrophic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) highlights an urgent need for improving scientific understanding of the underlying mechanisms of viral entry and propagation. SARS-CoV-2 uses the host ACE2 receptor protein and protease TMPRSS2 to gain cellular entry; however, what organs and cell types express these genes and how they interact with the host immune system remain obscure. Recent advancements in single-cell technologies now allow for the dissection of cell types and cell states at unprecedented resolution, which has led to groundbreaking discoveries in tissue biology. This project will integrate single-cell RNA-sequencing data across multiple individuals to assess how expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the lung, the primary organ linked to coronavirus infection, are associated with an individual’s age, gender and smoking history. It will also provide a broader context of the distinct cell types in the lung and gut expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and elucidate the gene expression programs and signaling pathways that are associated with viral entry in healthy individuals. Finally, analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility data from different lung regions will identify the key transcription factors and regulatory mechanisms driving the expression programs related to viral entry. Taken together, this project will lead to a better understanding of coronavirus infection mechanisms.

"This grant will support fundamental research in aquatic propulsion mechanisms. This study will benefit science and engineering fields such as exploration, transportation, and defense, by boosting the development of bio-inspired locomotion based on the fundamental principles that make fish-swimming highly efficient and agile. Accurate modeling of the interplay between a flexible body and the surrounding fluid is crucial to understanding and optimizing energy consumption, speed, and maneuverability. Existing models of undulatory swimming are restrictive in the forms of motion and the flow conditions they can describe accurately. This study will help to overcome those restrictions by introducing more realistic body motion and flow conditions. A novel body-fin dynamical model will be developed that includes previously ignored key elements important for swimming performance. This research combines vibration theory, fluid and solid mechanics, and both numerical and experimental analyses, offering interdisciplinary research for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as creative activities for K-12 outreach including fish-design competitions.

Undulatory swimming is a result of the nonlinear interaction between the body and surrounding fluid. Subtle changes in internal forcing and body deformation may induce significant differences in swimming performance. This award supports research that will address the fundamental challenges of accurate fluid-structure modeling under variable body-fin configurations with diverse swim gaits and conditions. A reduced-order model of undulatory swimming motion of a slender body as a forced hydroelastic oscillator will be developed to connect internal muscle forcing, external fluid forces, and body motion in an efficient approach based on state-variable modal analysis. Nonholonomic constraints on fins will be used to bypass the fluid-force prediction based on classical hydrodynamic models, which are restricted to idealized geometry and flow conditions. The use of nonsynchronous modes will enable the description of general body waves with longitudinally-varying properties. High-fidelity computational fluid-structure simulations, and innovative water-tunnel measurements based on refractive index matching, coupled with the structural analysis, will be used to investigate detailed features of the interactions between the fluid, structure, and neuromuscular activation and improve the reduced-order model. Then, the model will be used to evaluate optimized morphology and internal forcing patterns in viscous to inertial swim regimes, for uniform and complex background flows.

"This project proposes to provide work-based educational experiences to help prepare community college students for careers in biotechnology. Project partners include Skyline Community College, Laney Community College, regional high school science teachers, and a nonprofit community partner, Bay Area Bioscience Education Community. The project will provide community college students with skills-based job training by involving them in preparation, quality testing, and packaging of low-cost biotechnology materials for use in high school biology courses. Examples of these materials include solutions and mixtures that are commonly used in processes such as DNA analysis in both biotechnology and biological research.  As they prepare these educational materials for use in high school classes, community college students learn industry bio-manufacturing procedures and quality control processes.  Production of these materials via community college biotechnology classrooms will result in savings that will be passed on, helping high school teachers to more readily provide biotechnology educational experiences in their high school science classrooms. Through these efforts, the project aims to make biotechnology science education materials more affordable to high schools and provide community college students with work-based learning experiences that prepare them for jobs as skilled biotechnicians. 

Building on prior work that developed a successful plan to recruit high school students into community college biotechnology programs, this project aims to: 1) Expand and improve the pilot program by building upon past success and lessons learned; 2) Create stronger linkages and educational pathways between high schools and community colleges; 3) Provide professional development for faculty and collaborate with high schools to co-develop a new high school biotechnology curriculum; and 4) Scale the project regionally, engage industry in partnerships, and incorporate long-term sustainability measures. If successful, the project will provide a workable and scalable template for sustainable technician education that incorporates best practices across multiple sectors and institutions.  In providing pathways to careers in biotechnology, the project has included approaches intended to ensure that all students have equitable access to participate.  An important feature of the project is its plan to expand into introductory high school science courses that are required for all students.  Such an expansion will enable them to reach all students, not just those who self-select into biotechnology electives. This approach is likely to help the nation to develop a more diverse pipeline of employees into the highly skilled technician workforce. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.

"This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant will support fundamental research to reveal how the design attributes and operation strategies will influence the transmission of and exposure to infectious pathogens within mass-gathering civil infrastructure systems. During the pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus, the mass-gathering civil infrastructure systems, such as schools, airports, and public transit systems, can become hot spots for spreading the infectious disease. There remains a striking knowledge gap in understanding the impacts of infrastructure design and operation on the occurrence, distribution, transport, and viability of pathogens. It is imperative to address this knowledge gap. Results from this project will lead to bio-informed guidelines for managing critical civil infrastructure systems to prevent exposure of facility users to pathogenic microorganisms, and reduce risks of spreading infectious diseases, and thus alleviating burdens on healthcare systems and citizens. This project will provide much needed insights for infrastructure design reconfigurations and operation practices during the pandemic, in the recovery, and beyond to prevent further disease outbreaks and support healthy, resilient, and smart communities. As a result, this project will help promote public health, national security, and economic prosperity. In addition, this project will raise public science literacy and awareness of infectious diseases, and improve student education and training, as well as K-12 outreach and engagement activities. 

The specific objective of this research is to parameterize relevant design attributes and operation strategies of infrastructure systems, and subsequently evaluate their impacts on pathogen transmission and exposure from spatiotemporal microbiome profiles. Three aims will be pursued: 1) identify and quantify the design attributes and operation strategies that may impact pathogen dynamics; 2) audit the types, abundance, and co-occurrence patterns, as well as spatiotemporal dynamics of microorganisms, particularly pathogens, associated with spatially and functionally distributed system components; and 3) characterize the impacts of design and operation on the transmission and exposure pathways of microorganisms in infrastructure systems. The spatial and functional interdependence of system components will be considered to parameterize design attributes based on building information modeling and syntactic analysis. The operation strategies will be modeled using integrated data sensing and simulation techniques. A model-informed sampling approach will be developed with molecular and metagenomics techniques to characterize spatiotemporal microbiome dynamics. The impacts of design and operation on microbial transmission and exposure pathways will be assessed using integrated source tracking and machine learning methods. At the nexus of infrastructure system engineering and environmental microbiology, this convergence research will provide unique insights into design attributes and operation practices impacting pathogen transmission and exposure in mass-gathering civil infrastructure systems.

"With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Kirshenbaum at New York University is studying a family of “peptoid” molecules that mimic natural proteins. Peptoids are peptide-mimics but with the side chain connected to the nitrogen of the peptide backbone. Because this unique backbone structure, they often are more stable in biological systems and can be used for therapeutic applications. Professor Kirshenbaum's project explores how organizing the peptoids into cyclic structures may enable the design of new molecules with elaborate structures and valuable functions. The broader impacts of the project include collaborations with researchers on the chemical biology of cancer and creation of intellectual property for commercial development of bioactive peptidomimetics. Students contributing to the project are trained at the interface of bio-organic chemistry and biomedicine. Professor Kirshenbaum provides valuable training for a broad range of students including a project suitable for high school students. Professor Kirshenbaum makes TV appearances and appears in social media that informs the general public about the properties and functions of biological molecules. 
 
Peptoids are peptidomimetic oligomers composed of N-substituted glycine units. A variety of biomimetic properties have recently been described for peptoids. In order to further develop functional peptoids, the project is pursuing new strategies to enforce their conformational ordering. The research establish predictable relationships between the sequence, the structure, and the function of peptoid oligomers. In particular, the project explores the use of macrocyclic constraints to dictate the folding of peptoids for diverse applications. These applications include complex metal-associated, self-assembling materials and peptoid macrocycles to antagonize protein-protein interactions of biomedical importance. Establishing improved computational strategies for prediction of peptoid macrocycle structures is a critical component of the research plan.  Teaching modules introduce peptidomimetic enzyme inhibitors to undergraduate biochemistry laboratory classes.

"Access to coronavirus testing is integral to the effort to curb and control the spread of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 diagnostic tests currently implement a technique called reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This technique requires two reagent kits. The first is used to extract the genetic material, ribonucleic acid (RNA), from the coronavirus, and the second is used to amplify the RNA to enable its detection with RT-PCR. The current diagnostic crisis is due, in part, to shortages of the RNA extraction kits and the time required to extract the RNA using the kits. Increasing both the availability and time-efficiency of these kits is vital to improve testing accessibility and enhance the reliability of clinical diagnostics. In this project, a novel process for producing porous sorbent materials will be used to develop an alternative extraction kit for efficient and rapid extraction of nucleic acids from patient samples. The performance will be further optimized by studying the molecular mechanisms governing nucleic acid capture and release by the sorbents and applying this fundamental knowledge. The development and clinical validation of a novel extraction kit will be followed by mass production, addressing the current shortage and improving access to COVID-19 testing. The close collaboration between engineers developing the diagnostic technologies and clinicians implementing the prototypes, as enabled by this project, will streamline the transition of scientific knowledge into solutions that benefit the health and well-being of society. The project will also provide workforce development opportunities through training researchers in novel diagnostic techniques for coronaviruses.

The goal of this project is to develop a novel, scalable approach to nucleic acid separation and concentration and mass-produce prototype kits for immediate implementation in clinical settings. The concept relies on the use of sorbent materials instead of the current filter- and silica column-based approach. Unlike filters that use pore size to physically separate the target (here nucleic acids) from the media, sorbents are a porous material that captures the target by chemical affinity and interactions. As a result, the use of a sorbent enables larger water flow rates, enhanced nucleic acid capture efficiency, and faster sample processing, and overcomes the need for multiple buffers or extraction steps. Functionalization of conventional filters with a combination of metal oxide nanoparticles and organosiloxane polymers will be used to produce the nucleic acid sorbent. The functionalization will be achieved by a new method for supported synthesis of nanoparticles by thermolysis and polymer conjugation. The efficiency of the sorbent will be assessed by the extraction and detection of nucleic acid using quantitative RT-PCR. Validation of the alternative sorbent kit will assess the effectiveness of the rapid separation and concentration of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. The project will also explore the fundamentals of nucleic acid dynamics in porous sorbents as it relates to nucleic acid size, sorbent chemistry, porosity and pore size, and the effect of transport phenomena in porous media. Enhanced understanding of the factors that affect the retention, release, and transport of nucleic acids in porous media is critical to producing reliable and efficient nucleic acid extraction and detection kits and the development of other bio-separation processes. Training of postdoctoral researchers and graduate and undergraduate students will focus on how the combination of transdisciplinary collaboration and a clear understanding of the fundamental aspects can lead to disruptive technologies.

"An award is made to the University of Maryland to develop a novel imaging technology, light-sheet Brillouin microscopy, to measure how biological cells grow into complex tissues during embryonic development. While previous technologies have mostly focused on probing genetic and biochemical control of tissue growth, this research will improve the understanding the biomechanical aspect of embryonic development. The project will generate a new instrument whose performance and design will be disseminated via conferences, peer-reviewed journal papers as well as hosting interested biological researchers. The project, at the interface of photonics, biomechanics and developmental biology, will provide opportunities to educate and train graduate and undergraduate students with a diverse set of skills. The project will also be used to attract middle-school students to STEM fields with activities relying on hands-on exercises that create quick connections between photonic technology and real-life familiar applications.  
 
While our understanding of genetic, biochemical and molecular controls of tissue growth can rely on several established methods, the biomechanics of tissue morphogenesis remains poorly understood mostly due to the lack of suitable measurement techniques. This project addresses this need by developing light-sheet Brillouin microscopy capable of mapping elastic modulus in a developing embryo without contact at high 3D resolution. Brillouin  microscopy has already proven impactful in tissue and cell biomechanics, but currently relies on point-scanning to build an image and thus is not suited for embryo studies due to speed and damage limitations. This project will develop massively multiplexed Brillouin spectral analysis and integrate it in widely used light-sheet microscopy platforms, which already provide structural and functional imaging, thus enabling mechanobiology studies of morphogenesis with co-localization of elasticity information, cell/tissue size, shape and organization as well as signaling activation and expression patterns.  Co-Funding for this award is also being provided by the BIO/IOS-Developmental Systems Cluster.

"Analyzing single neuron's property is a fundamental task to understand the nervous system and brain working mechanism. Investigating neuron morphology is an effective way to analyze neurons, since it plays a major role in determining neurons' properties. Recently, the ever-increasing neuron databases have greatly facilitated the research of neuron morphology. However, the sheer volume and complexity of these data pose significant challenges for computational analysis, preventing the realization of the full potential of such data. This interdisciplinary project will seek for new avenue to assemble the massive neuron morphologies and provide a unified framework for neuroscientists to explore and analyze different types of neurons. The research is able to tackle many challenges in neuroscience which are hard to solve with previous methods, including fine-grained neuron identification, latent pattern discovery and exploration, etc. The large-scale methods being developed will be particularly beneficial in the future of neuroscience, since more and more neurons are reconstructed and added to the databases. The computational methods and tools developed are very likely to be applicable for solving other bioinformatics problems, especially those dealing with large-scale datasets. The broader impact of this project not only includes educational support for undergraduate researchers and high school students, particularly women and those underrepresented groups, but also contributes to the research of neuroscience and other STEM fields.

The long-term goal of this project is to develop effective computational methods and tools for neuroscientists to interactively explore large-scale neuron databases with ultra-fine-grained accuracy, in real-time. This research has a strong multidisciplinary component that involves a nexus ideas from machine learning, information retrieval, and neuroinformatics. Particularly, novel ideas will be implemented in three inter-related components through the whole framework. The first one addresses the accurate and efficient neuron reconstruction and tracing based on deep learning models. The second addresses the efficient discovery of relevant instances among large-size neuron databases via multi-modal and online binary coding methods. The third part addresses intelligent visualization and interaction schemes for knowledge discovery and mining, equipped with interactive coding that can incorporate domain experts' feedback to enhance the query algorithms for fine-tuned results. Compared with previous methods and systems, this project will open a new avenue to assist neuroscientists analyzing and exploring large-scale neuron databases with high efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. The performance of proposed methods will be validated using public neuro-morphological databases (e.g., NeuroMorpho, BigNeuron) and compared with several benchmarks. The effectiveness of the tools to be developed will be evaluated by neuroscientists on domain-specific hypothesis-driven applications.

"Because of the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is severe urgency for accurate point-of-care detection of COVID-19. The investigator will develop colorimetric aptamer-based COVID-19 virus sensors that will change their color or visually indicate the presence of COVID-19 on their sensitive surfaces. COVID-19 aptamers will be synthesized and when bonded with COVID-19 will cause a visible change in the sensor that can be viewed with the naked eye. They will also develop COVID-19 sensors that turn “red” when COVID-19 is present. The sensor surface is functionalized with the COVID-19 aptamers that is in contact with a buffer solution containing fluorescent microbeads. They are also functionalized with COVID-19 aptamers. The beads do not attach to the sensor surface unless COVID-19 is present to bridge them together. In the presence of COVID-19 the bright red microbeads attach to the sensor surface completely changing its color. 


Based on extensive experience with similar sensors designed to detect Zika viruses, biofluids such as stimulant urine does not affect sensor’s performance. Heat inactivated COVID-19 will be used in preliminary experiments. They will be obtained from Zeptometrix corporation and they do not require Bio Safety Level 2 (BSL-2) laboratories for handling. Sensors capable of detecting a single COVID-19 virus will also be developed in this study. Tunneling current sensors (TCS), field-effect transistors using COVID-19 conducting channels, terahertz and UV-VIS spectroscopy, DC conductivity sensors, quartz crystal micro balance and micro-electro-mechanical microbalance will also be developed. Terahertz sensors along with their shorter wavelength optical counterparts have the potential to remotely sense COVID-19 without requiring aptamers. The goal is to have a working COVID-19 handheld sensor in 2 months.

"Biomechanics has contributed a rich understanding of the physical principles that dictate organismal form and function, but the field has been slow to incorporate study of the evolution of mechanical diversity. In this CAREER project, the principal investigator (PI) will combine experiments on live organisms, computer modeling, and statistical analyses of the evolution of species differences to understand the evolution of diversity of body form and movement. The project will focus on (1) how different body structures scale with body size; (2) how the size of these structures and different behavioral strategies affect aquatic locomotion (i.e. swimming); (3) how sensitive swimming performance is to variation in such variables; and (4) how these relationships between form and function have affected long-term evolutionary change in swimming performance across >140 species of frogs and toads around the world. The key intellectual contribution of the project will be to develop an evolutionarily explicit approach to studies of form, function, and their diversity across species. The project will also more broadly support scientific capacity in the USA by (1) training secondary science teachers in research methods, evolutionary concepts, and integration of research into their classrooms; (2) training undergraduate students in the study of animal movement and research methods through in-class research projects; and (3) training young researchers in biomechanics to more directly incorporate evolutionary analysis methods into their projects. 

This project integrates biomechanical modeling, kinematics from high-speed videos, and phylogenetic comparative methods to understand the evolution of form-function relationships and their impact on macroevolution of morphology and swimming performance in anurans. The project has three key aims. In Aim 1 the PI will examine the evolution of allometry in locomotor morphology, highlighting how to leverage phylogenetic comparative methods to best estimate interspecific allometric scaling exponents. In Aim 2, he will address the mechanics and scaling of swimming in anurans. He will develop and empirically test a mathematical model of the complete swimming stroke in frogs, then use the model and phylogenetic comparative methods to explain the scaling between peak swimming velocity and body mass. In Aim 3, the PI will examine the sensitivity of swimming performance to different morphological variables through both mathematical and statistical modeling, and he will test the tempo and mode of morphological and swimming performance evolution as a function of mechanical sensitivity. The intellectual merit of the project primarily stems from integrating disparate methods (experiments, mathematical modeling, phylogenetic analyses) and providing an evolutionary comparative framework for testing general physical principles and their influence on the macroevolution of form and function. The broader impacts of the project will result from developing secondary education in scientific research and evolutionary concepts in the PI's state, integrating research training into undergraduate laboratories, and training young researchers in biomechanics in phylogenetic comparative methods workshops. 

This project is jointly funded by the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program of BIO-Integrative Organismal Systems and the Established Program to Support Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"Fundamental research in human biology has provided insight into the complexity of breastfeeding as a unique form of maternal investment that is responsive to offspring cues, sensitive to environmental inputs, and capable of influencing short- and long-term offspring outcomes. While much of this research has focused on implications for infant physiology, comparatively little is known about the biological determinants and impacts of breastfeeding practices among mothers. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the maternal physiological dynamics of breastfeeding, advancing knowledge about the ways in which immune function, physiological status, and behavior are interrelated in humans. The research may also inform public health research and practice about breastfeeding behaviors. The project will facilitate graduate and undergraduate training and mentoring, and research outcomes will be shared with the participant community as well as a broader research and public audience. 

Few studies have directly examined the link between maternal immune function, maternal physiological status, and breastfeeding behavior in humans during the perinatal period. This study will longitudinally measure breastfeeding behavior, immunological biomarkers, and perceived physical and mental well-being among a heterogenous sample of pregnant and postpartum women in the United States, a population exhibiting unprecedented variation in breastfeeding behavior. The resulting data will be used to test two overarching hypotheses: (1) heightened inflammatory activation in late pregnancy will predict increased breastfeeding difficulties and impaired maternal physiological status, and (2) continuation of skin-to-skin breastfeeding across the early postpartum period will correspond to better regulated immune “bounce-back” and enhanced maternal physiological status. Findings generated by this study have the potential to inform current public health strategies to (1) identify mothers who may experience heightened barriers to breastfeeding success, (2) provide support for women to continue breastfeeding, and (3) support mental and physical maternal well-being during the transition from pregnancy to the postpartum period.

"Growth is a central aspect of a species’ biology, and modern humans are fundamentally different in the timing, duration, and pace of our growth compared to other primates. Understanding when and why the modern human growth pattern evolved is key to understanding part of what makes modern humans unique among primates. This doctoral dissertation project examines the links between variation in primate growth rates and hormonal underpinnings via the pituitary gland and a bony structure, the sella turcica. In doing so, it will develop a novel, non-destructive method for estimating individual growth rates and will investigate the effects of ecology and environment on living primates’ growth rates. The insights into pituitary and sella turcica growth and evolution provided by these data also have the potential to inform diagnoses of abnormal pituitary conditions and the etiology of growth deficiencies or diseases related to pituitary hormones. This project will support graduate training and undergraduate research experiences at Arizona State University (ASU), expanding educational opportunities and providing undergraduates with advanced visualization and 3D processing skills that can be applied to fields as varied as engineering and medicine. In addition, the researcher will communicate project findings through science education outreach activities for student and public audiences. 

Given the importance of growth, the ultimate causes (or selective pressures) that shape growth rates have long been the subject of research, but the proximate mechanisms that underpin variation in growth rates are less well studied. At the proximate level, body growth is the direct result of hormones produced by endocrine glands such as the pituitary. This project builds upon the relationship between the size of the pituitary, which is positively correlated with growth rate across mammalian taxa, and the sella turcica, the bony structure within which the pituitary gland is housed, to first test whether the size of the nonhuman primate sella turcica reflects body growth rate. This goal will be achieved by pairing 3D cranial morphology data with growth data from well-studied primate populations. Second, this research will assess how aspects of ecology and demography (i.e., ultimate causes such as resource availability, food quality, mortality) relate to living primates’ body growth rates both within the study populations and across a comparative sample of 51 species. It will then assess whether these ecological variables also explain variations in relative sella turcica size. Together, the complementary components of this project will contribute to a better understanding of primate growth.

"Humans are distinguished by their ability to walk upright on two legs and their capacity for endurance running. This behavior is explained in part by the endurance capabilities of human skeletal muscle, which, in comparison to chimpanzees, are better suited for holding bodies upright and being active for prolonged periods without fatiguing. However, it is unknown how this property of human skeletal muscle evolved due to its absence from the fossil record and a limited understanding of muscle fiber development at the genetic level. This doctoral dissertation project will identify the genetic switches controlling muscle fiber development using a suite of cutting-edge molecular methods. In doing so, this research will add novel information about the complex genetic landscape underlying muscle fiber development and illuminate the evolutionary history of a unique human trait that may have played a key role in bipedal evolution. This project will support graduate training in advanced molecular methods and bioinformatics. Additionally, the researcher will share their findings with the public by hosting a “science run” outreach event. Finally, data generated from this research will help characterize muscle biology at the genetic level and therefore has the potential to help target more efficient treatments for a range of neuromuscular diseases.

Understanding when, why and how the transition to bipedalism occurred over the course of human evolution is a fundamental question in biological anthropology. As a species, humans are characterized by a suite of well-described anatomical adaptations that support efficient, long-distance bipedal locomotion. While many of these traits are observable in the fossil record (e.g., bone morphology), others (e.g., properties of skeletal muscle) are more difficult to detect. The high proportion of fatigue-resistant slow-twitch muscle fibers in human hind limb muscles optimizes them to perform tonic, endurance-based activities, and suggests that this trait helps enable long-distance bipedal locomotion. Yet, the genetic mechanisms controlling this trait are not well understood. To address this gap in knowledge, this project will identify the genetic mechanisms underlying muscle fiber development and reconstruct the evolutionary history of these mechanisms across primates. The central hypothesis of this research is that natural selection has selected for human-specific variation in regions of the genome that influence muscle fiber type, increasing the amount of slow-twitch fibers in human hind limb skeletal muscles and the efficiency of bipedal locomotion. To test this hypothesis, the researcher will first use a tailored ATACseq approach to identify those parts of the genome that are active in mammalian muscle tissues and associated with muscle fiber type. Next, they will test the function of a subset of these regions with human-specific variation. In doing so, this project will enrich anthropological understandings of human evolution by identifying regions of the human genome that have shaped the biology of a trait highly relevant to bipedalism.

"In biocultural research, anthropologists are interested in the complex interactions between biology and culture that occur throughout the human lifecourse. One important part of the lifecourse is the time immediately following the birth of a child, when mothers experience physiological changes, may be vulnerable to various stressors, and potentially receive help from other individuals. This doctoral dissertation research examines the relationships between maternal postpartum depression, culturally relevant social support, and maternal levels of the hormone oxytocin, to better understand the postpartum period from a biocultural perspective. The project will advance fundamental knowledge about maternal dynamics and the biocultural nature of our species. The research may also have broader public health impact by informing culturally appropriate interventions for improving postpartum maternal health. In addition, the project will support graduate training, international research collaborations, and community science outreach. 

A cooperative breeding model has been used to describe patterns of infant care in humans. Mothers especially benefit from help during the immediate postpartum when the stress of caring for an altricial infant co-occurs with physical recovery from pregnancy. This project focuses on maternal characteristics in the immediate postpartum, thereby extending beyond previous work that focused largely on reproductive fitness and infant outcomes. Following a cohort of women who share cultural expectations regarding postpartum support, this study will examine whether greater discordance between received and expected social support in the postpartum is related to maternal depressive symptoms, and whether oxytocin and social support levels are related. The project will characterize local cultural expectations of social support via interviews with women. A group of 150 pregnant women will be interviewed during their third trimester, and again approximately 40 days postpartum to determine congruence between received support (reported and directly observed) and cultural expectations of social support, depressive symptoms, and urine oxytocin levels.

"Life on earth is fueled by photosynthesis, which converts sunlight into metabolic energy forms. In plants, photosynthetic energy conversion is realized by pigment-protein complexes that are harbored in highly specialized thylakoid membranes inside the chloroplasts. The dynamic response of the protein landscape in thylakoid membranes to unpredictable environmental changes (i.e. fluctuations in sunlight intensity by clouds, self-shading of leaves in wind) triggers photoprotective high-energy quenching (qE) that is essential for the survival of the plant. The project will map qE-induced protein landscape dynamics in thylakoid membranes with molecular resolution as a basis for understanding key photosynthetic functions. The intellectual merit of the proposed work is that it defines an innovative and complete pipeline of methods, ranging from state-of the art electron microscopy to coarse grain computer simulations, which will provide a quantitative understanding of photosynthetic light harvesting and electron transport. This pipeline will lead to urgently needed insights into dynamic structure-function relationships in thylakoid membranes. Furthermore, it is raising protein landscape analysis to a new level with unprecedented resolution to increase our in-depth understanding of photosynthetic energy conversion. The broader impact of the project is twofold:  First, it will provide hands-on research experience to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, and establish a new computer-based teaching tool for a computational chemistry course. Second, social benefits of the proposed work are expected for the improvement of crop plants and biofuel prospects since it turns out that optimization and adjustment of the qE mechanisms by bioengineering could be a powerful tool to increase plant performances. 

To generate high-resolution protein maps of the thylakoid protein landscape as basis to provide mechanistic understanding for the qE-dependent regulation of light-harvesting and electron transport, three specific aims will be pursued. Aim #1: Establishing high-resolution protein maps for different qE states. Plants will be examined using electron microscopy and compositional analysis which will lead to detailed coarse grain thylakoid protein landscapes. Aim #2: Determine how qE-induced changes in protein landscapes impact light harvesting and photoprotective qE. Coarse grain protein maps of thylakoid membranes will be used to model photosynthetic light harvesting in order to interpret measured data. Aim #3: Determine how qE-triggered switches in protein landscapes control diffusion dependent electron transport. A dynamic protein landscape model for the entire thylakoid membrane will be developed that allows simulation of the whole photosynthetic electron transport to understand in vivo data.

"Microplastic and nano plastic particles enter the environment directly through consumer personal care products and are formed in the environment as commercial products such as plastic packaging weather and degrade. Oceans and coastal ecosystems are major sinks for plastic pollution. Plastics have been shown to accumulate in and negatively impact the health of marine life, which in turn places added stress on ecosystems as well as marine industries reliant on the health of these ecosystems. The ultimate fate and adverse impacts of these small plastic particles depends on how they interact and are transported in nature. A critical natural component of oceans and a point of initial exposure to plastic pollution are sea surface microlayers, which are ubiquitous globally and are comprised of natural molecules, particulate matter, and microorganisms. These microlayers act as an “ocean skin” that influences the exchange of mass and heat between the seawater and the atmosphere. They are also sites for microplastic and nano plastic accumulation. This project will study how microplastics and nano plastics interact with model sea surface microlayers, how these interactions cause them to accumulate and transform at the sea surface, and to what extent microplastics and nano plastics will alter the properties of sea surface microlayers. The goal is to provide fundamental insight into interfacial and colloidal properties leading to microplastic and nano plastic accumulation that can contribute broadly to determining environmental risks of plastic pollution and to devising strategies for remediation. Participation will be broadened by partnering with the Northeast NSF Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation program to provide research experiences to two supported underrepresented students. These students will also lead a new middle school outreach activity. 


Sea surface microlayers, which range from 1 to 1000 micrometers thick, are ubiquitous globally on ocean and coastal waters, regulating the exchange of mass and energy between these waters and the atmosphere. Sea surface microlayers are also a site of accumulation for heavy metal, organic, and particulate pollutants including micro- and nano-plastics. This project is motivated by the following needs: Representative and commercially relevant micro- and nano-plastics enabling laboratory studies, suitable microlayer systems that are broadly applicable and enable actionable results relating to fate, transport, and nanoscale interactions, and microscopy techniques needed to characterize sea surface microlayers containing particulate matter. Well-characterized and size-fractionated model micro- and nano-plastics will be created by mechanical and UV degradation (Aim 1). Phytoplankton sea surface microlayers will be prepared in a modified Langmuir trough (Aim 2) and used to quantify the accumulation and transformation of micro- and nano-plastics as a function of their physical properties and composition (Aim 3). To realize the broader impact of the project to education, outreach, and diversity and inclusion, underrepresented students will be engaged in research activities and a new middle-school outreach initiative will be created. Marine plastics provide a versatile and timely platform to engage students in STEM activities. The transformative aspects of this work derive from the limited understanding of the role of the sea surface microlayers in micro- and nano-plastic accumulation and include identifying currently unknown mechanisms of interaction and transformation, demonstrating the ability to utilize complex field samples to study micro- and nano-particle interactions with bio-environmental interfaces, and creating a new experimental framework that can be broadly applied to different ocean and coastal regions. Participation will be broadened by partnering with the Northeast NSF Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation program to provide research experiences to two supported underrepresented students.

"Multi-agent systems, an important class of interconnected/networked systems composing a group of distributed interacting entities, have been emerging as a powerful paradigm for various unprecedented engineering applications, such as spacecraft formation flying, air-traffic management, sensory networks, etc. Through collaboration, a multi-agent system can accomplish numerous complicated control tasks that surpass the capability of a single dynamical system, such as moving an oversized object, environmental monitoring, and disaster search/rescue. Moreover, a multi-agent system can solve some problems faster using parallelism and increase robustness through redundancy. However, implementing cooperative multi-agent systems also presents challenges, making many related applications (especially those demanding critical controlled performance) remain conceptual. One important challenge lies in the lack of a systematic approach that allows control engineers to treat associated multi-agent distributed control design in a computationally-efficient and fully-integrated manner. Existing approaches of separating the design into high- and low-level controls often fail to analytically guarantee reliability, which is a critical requirement for acceptance by control engineers. This project supports fundamental research to provide the knowledge needed to overcome these challenges, thereby promoting broader real-world applications of multi-agent distributed control techniques. This project will also create unique opportunities to promote engineering education through the development of a cross-departmental robotics engineering program, and to boost minority involvement in scientific research.

The goal of this project is to make fundamental contributions to the advancement of distributed multi-agent control theory by (i) developing novel hybrid switching control schemes to address complicated factors (e.g., agent’s physical dynamics, actuation and data sampling limitations, communication delays) in a holistic, one-shot  distributed control design, and (ii) generating effective computational tools from combined deterministic and probabilistic perspectives to enable balancing design complexity and controlled performance. It will introduce innovative methodologies and tools to the field, leading to the following important paradigm changes: (i) from separated two-step designs dominantly adopted in current study to holistic, one-shot designs with provable network stability and controlled performance; (ii) from Lyapunov functions with simple quadratic forms dominantly utilized for current stability analysis and distributed control synthesis to Lyapunov functions with advanced composite forms that would significantly reduce analysis conservatism and improve controlled performance; and (iii) from distributed algorithms with trivial state/output feedback controller structures dominantly exploited by existing methods to distributed algorithms with novel hybrid controller structures of mixed continuous-time and discrete-event dynamics, facilitating simplified distributed optimal control synthesis via off-line convex optimization.

"Mycobacterium tuberculosis has a global distribution and infects over a million new people each year. In the pre-contact Americas, tuberculosis (TB) infection was caused by a strain that is found today in seals and sea lions. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how a zoonotic strain of TB adapted to humans as a primary host and spread across the Americas. Throughout the project, undergraduate students at Arizona State University will be trained in genomic lab work and analysis, and the resulting datasets will be used to create undergraduate-level workshops. The research team will demonstrate an equitable international collaboration by fostering mutual understanding and inclusivity among affiliated parties, thereby facilitating long-term, innovative, and productive relationships between institutions.

The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) refers to a group of similar pathogens that cause TB infection in humans and animals. Genomes extracted from archaeological remains show that zoonotic lineages were responsible for human TB infections in the past. Most TB infections in humans today, however, are caused by M. tuberculosis, the human-adapted MTBC lineage. The evolutionary steps of an animal-adapted pathogen becoming a human-adapted pathogen are not entirely understood. The researchers will draw comparisons between modern and ancient MTBC genomes to understand better how zoonotic lineages of TB adapt to humans as primary hosts. Ancient MTBC genomes will be extracted from archaeological skeletons. The research team focuses on a densely populated city and trade epicenter to determine the breadth of genomic diversity of ancient circulating MTBC strains, some of which were likely imported through long-distance trade. As human populations expand and the interface between humans and wildlife narrows, understanding the genomic underpinnings of zoonotic transmission dynamics will inform public health surveillance measures. The results of these comparisons will help frame future epidemiological, evolutionary biology, and infectious disease research.

"Novel coronavirus disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2, an extremely virulent strain of coronavirus that is responsible for an increasing number of illnesses and deaths, globally. According to the World Health Organization, “SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via droplets and fomites during close unprotected contact between an infector and an infectee”.  A recent study has shown that these virions can be airborne for at least 30 minutes and be active on the aerosol droplets up to three hours.  Non-pharmaceutical protection is essential to stunt the spread of this virus. As of March 19, 2020, the Center for Disease Control’s official guidelines include non-optimal reuse of surgical masks for extended periods of time.  Then, on March 27, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a critical emergency on personal protection equipment.  The reuse of masks puts healthcare workers, first line responders, patients, and the community at risk. The aim of this research project between the University of Texas-Austin and the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital is to develop and implement a rapid protocol for extended use of surgical and N95 masks.

This proposal addresses a critical need to improve personal protection equipment during the coronavirus crisis. A new extended use protocol for masks will render immediate benefits to the healthcare community.

This research project has the following objectives: (i) obtain masks from the Shands hospital, treat them with surfactants, ultraviolet-C ray, and steam, and then characterize the efficacy of each treatment using viability tests, (ii) modify mask surfaces with surfactant-modified (sodium lauryl sulfate, butadines, or stearoyl lactylate) carbon particles (activated carbon, carbon quantum dots, or nano-diamond) at different ratios and moisture content and then test their efficacy in attaching and inactivating coronaviruses, (iii) understand the mechanisms of virus attachment and inactivation, and (iv) implement a rapid extended mask-use program. The outcomes from this project should have critical and widespread scientific and public health impacts.  The modified masks could provide needed support to the depleted mask-inventory of health care providers.

"Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the home institution. The award to Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University has potential broader impacts in a number of areas. The goal of this project is to probe the dynamic environments that exist within mammalian cells to eventually understand disease processes and the development of therapeutic molecules. The project is a collaborative effort with faculty at Florida State University and involves undergraduate students in the research.

The overarching research goal of the project is to develop a strategy for investigating cellular and sub-cellular environments of mammalian cells with high spatial and temporal resolution using engineered bacterial flagella. Towards this goal, the investigation specifically aims to characterize flagellar polymorphism in physiological relevant environments found within the cytosol; chemically modify flagella-based magnetic colloidal swimmers with stimuli-responsive small molecules; and to investigate active and passive internalization facilitated by externally driven forces and cell-mediated biochemical mechanisms. The development of these wirelessly controlled soft sensors will enable minimally invasive direct probing of nano scale fluidic environments.

"Shipworms live in the ocean and are related to clams. They are some of a very few animals in the world that can eat wood. They also play an important role in nature by recycling the carbon in wood. It is estimated that between 2 - 5% of the world’s woody plant material is eaten by shipworms. The goal of this project is to understand how shipworms eat wood. Digesting wood’s complex structure isn’t easy. Scientists know that relatively large enzymes alone cannot break down wood, because wood molecules are packed too tightly together for enzymes to enter. Shipworms farm bacteria in their gills, and these bacteria have recently been found to produce very small compounds that may move into the shipworm gut where the small compounds can make powerful oxygen radicals to digest the wood. Making the oxygen radicals is proposed as the first step needed to break open the wood structure into smaller pieces. Then, in a second step, enzymes can completely digest the wood. Previously, the compounds that can make the oxygen radicals were found only in some types of fungi that also digest wood. Scientists believe that studying this shipworm chemistry may open up new knowledge about how carbon is cycled in our oceans, and may also lead to new discoveries on ways to make biofuels and renewable materials. The researchers involved in this project also believe strongly in supporting young, underrepresented female scientists and will be running educational opportunities for girls in a local town.

Shipworms are the principle degraders of lignocellulose across the world’s oceans; they cause billions of dollars of damage to wooden structures (boats, piers and sea-defenses), but they also play a major role in carbon-cycling. The relative simplicity of their symbiotic communities and the unique compartmentalization of their digestive system make shipworm symbiosis a tractable counterpoint to terrestrial xylotrophs (e.g., fungi, termites). The goal of this project is to explore the unknown mechanisms of wood digestion in shipworms by examining how these animals interact with their gill endosymbionts and determining specifically whether a symbiont-mediated chemical degradation mechanism is active in the host gut. There are three approaches to reach this goal. The first approach is to determine how low molecular-weight (LMW) metabolites from shipworm gill symbionts may be activated in the host gut to generate a non-enzymatic system for lignocellulose deconstruction. This involves mapping the location of LMW metabolites in the gill and digestive system. The second approach will examine gut compartmentalization for pH environments that may promote symbiont-mediated iron reduction, redox-cycling and the generation of hydroxyl radicals associated with CMF reactions. It will also assess the spatial arrangement and compartmentalization of shipworm anatomy, and identify and map structures linking the gill endosymbionts with the digestive tract. The third approach will compare and analyze the digestive products and waste material from shipworms grown on isotopically-labelled wood. Understanding the basis of wood digestion may allow discovery of candidate catalytic/enzymatic systems and development of new strategies for bio-based materials and biofuel production.

"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in China has become a global pandemic. Research into the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 is now essential to provide understanding of viral entry and infection of human cells, a first step in developing novel drugs and vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2.  The research supported through this RAPID award will enable the development of an all-atom molecular dynamic simulation of the virus that includes realistic predictions of the envelope, membrane and spike proteins of the virus, as well as simulations of the complex surfaces of the human cells that the virus infects.  This research could have immediate impact on steps taken to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2.  Simulation results will be broadly and quickly disseminated to ensure impact of the research.  In addition, the investigators will use this as a training opportunity for students at all levels.  

This project will use to state of the art tools of computational virology to provide bio-physical characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virion, revealing information relevant to the function and potential targeting and disruption of the virus. The PI proposes a study of the full-size viral envelope which can establish the effects of specific components of the virus, including its bilayer lipid composition, shedding light on the need for coronaviruses to remodel the host cell membrane for successful infection. Additionally the characterization of the native SARS-CoV-2 viral surface proteins, which represent key functional and antigenic sites, will form a good basis for development of an infectious SARS-CoV-2 virion and a platform to investigate a mechanism of host cell entry, in which coronaviruses bind to CD13 receptors in lipid rafts. Study of glycosylated S protein, proposed as one of the aspects of the work, will reveal details of epitope masking by the glycan shield, relevant to vaccine and antibody design, as well as the role of viral glycans in host cell adhesion in a second mechanism of cell entry mediated by S binding to ACE2 receptors.  The work could have immediate impact of the current pandemic.

"State hospitals in the United States have generated considerable discussion among practitioners, government officials, and the general public, from the rise of the asylum in the 19th-century through deinstitutionalization efforts originating in the 1950s. This doctoral dissertation project will examine the biological impact of institutionalization through skeletal analysis of persons who were institutionalized in the past. The research will advance our understanding of institutionalization beyond what can be gleaned from historical accounts alone, and offers a framework for future biological anthropology research to incorporate interdisciplinary approaches. The research may raise mental health awareness and presents an innovative method of linking health disparities in past institutionalized samples to modern-day psychiatric treatment. The project will support graduate training as well as public and descendant community science engagement.

This dissertation research uses skeletal samples from asylums in four states (Colorado, Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio) to understand how incarceration impacts institutionalized women’s health and how it is differentially embodied across ancestry and geographical region. In bioarchaeology, evidence can be seen through varying skeletal pathologies that reflect health disparities indicative of negative conditions that people endured during life. The analysis will focus on skeletal trauma, disease, and fracture analysis which will be statistically examined through hierarchical log-linear analysis and binomial logistic regression. The project highlights the heterogeneous physiological impact of past mental institutionalization in their socio-cultural and historical contexts. It investigates whether skeletal health and epidemiological differences or trends exist across institutionalized geographical samples and attempts to determine if differences in trauma and disease patterns between African-American and Euro-American groups are present in order to gain insight into the impact of racism and segregation within the institutional setting.

"The global COVID-19 pandemic causing considerable human health and economic impacts presents the research community with a unique set of challenges that must be addressed in real time. Critical to managing any pandemic is the accurate estimation of how many people are infected within communities. SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, is excreted in the stool of infected individuals, eventually ending up in the wastewater treatment plant. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in human waste presents the opportunity to potentially monitor wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 to estimate the number of infections in the community and provide an ‘early warning system’ for future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. The goal of this research is to develop methods to monitor for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and to connect these measurements to epidemiology models. In addition, the project team will coordinate wastewater monitoring efforts for SARS-CoV-2 globally. If successful, this research could lead to other similar monitoring efforts for other viral outbreaks and protect the health of the Nation. 
 
SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., 2019-nCoV) is identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness that is now a global  pandemic causing significant disruption to medical services and commerce. Significant uncertainties about the prevalence of this virus remain. This information which is vital to inform control recommendations and determine the case fatality rate. The recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stool raises the possibility of using wastewater-based epidemiological approaches to estimate the community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. In this approach, molecular quantification of SARS-CoV-2 will be combined with epidemiological data to model outbreak dynamics and estimate the overall prevalence of the virus in the community over time. These data will be integrated into epidemiological models using data from public health surveillance. Data from wastewater could inform epidemiological estimates on finer spatial scales than epidemiological data and could provide indications of continued community transmission following the initial wave of the pandemic. The potential for this virus to become a seasonally transmitted endemic pathogen like influenza and other coronaviruses would make this type of analysis increasingly informative. Technical developments resulting from this research include improved sample handling methods, molecular quantification approaches, integration of the resulting data into epidemiological models, as well as coordination with domestic and international collaborators to standardize methodology. There is significant scientific interest in using wastewater to monitor for SARS-CoV-2 beyond the current outbreak. This research will inform such efforts and help respond to future outbreaks.

"The goal of this project is to compare genomes of hundreds of mammal species, finding differences in DNA that distinguish species resistant to SARS-CoV-2 from those that are very susceptible. This information is needed to understand how the current SARS-CoV-2 virus spread to humans and to identify potential host animals (e.g., pet, livestock, and pest species) that may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 in the USA. SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, can infect diverse species of animals. There is a variation in susceptibility to and severity of disease between species. This variation suggests that some species have genetic differences that dictate susceptibility to COVID-19. This work will identify how coronaviruses adapt to new host species, information that will help predict and control future coronavirus outbreaks. Funding will support training a graduate student in research, thereby training the next generation of the bioeconomy workforce.  

This project will investigate how the host genome shapes host-pathogen interactions, and how coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 evolve to exploit new hosts. The researchers will compare existing genomic data for hundreds of mammals using three complementary approaches: (1) Measure structural and sequence homology in two host proteins, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, necessary for infection in humans; (2) Analyze existing RNA-seq datasets to (a) identify species with co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and potentially other proteases implicated in infection, in the same tissue, and (b) search for incidental coronaviral sequence data from diverse mammalian species; (3) Test for variants in evolutionarily conserved elements that are correlated with species susceptibility, using forward genomics. With these analyses, the researchers will identify species  with potential as reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 viral spillback into humans, and those that are promising systems for investigating SARS-CoV-2 evolution, host defenses, and host-pathogen interactions.

The need for a rapid coronavirus test platform is critical for confronting the COVID-19 pandemic which is pervasive throughout the world at the moment. The current lab testing time for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19, could be up to several days. The delays associated with such testing have already contributed to substantial lag times for diagnosis and data acquisition; therefore, urgent action is needed for the development of sensitive, rapid and simple-to-use platforms. The PI is developing one-pot sample-to-answer assay automated process that would detect the SARS coronavirus and yield information and process flows that prove to be generally informative for creating ergonomic point-of-care diagnostic platforms. The modular design of the method preserves rapid assay programmability for navigating constraints such as evolving viral genomes and low resource field deployment. Further translations of this foundational technology will aid detection efforts for other established and emerging pathogens such as Influenza and Dengue viruses. Development of the method involves both graduate and undergraduates students with research, development, marketing and commercialization efforts. Assays are being developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Austin Freshman Research Initiative where undergraduate students from many backgrounds are involved in cutting edge research from their first days on campus

The Ellington Lab at the University of Texas at Austin and Fabrico Technology Inc. are developing a complete and rapid point-of-care detection system for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The system provides accurate detection of the virus in a test format that can be performed in both clinical and field settings. The SARS-CoV-2 assay uses multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification integrated with a sequence-parsing probe system designed using principles of oligonucleotide strand displacement and a Boolean network to compute an accurate positive readout only when all intended viral signatures are identified in a single reaction. The modular design preserves rapid assay programability for navigating both biological and logistical constraints such as evolving viral genomes and low resource field deployment.

"This doctoral dissertation project will examine life histories and ritual using bioarchaeological and biogeochemical analyses of skeletons from archaeological contexts. The research will contribute novel methods and perspectives concerning the role of rituals in ancient societies as well as the integration of osteological and chemical techniques to reconstruct human behavior. This project and the dissemination of its results will increase participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences and encourage future collaborations by involving the public in this project’s excavations, technical workshops, and public lectures. As workshop leaders for the Center for K-12 STEM Education at Tulane University, the investigators will integrate the project’s results into K-12 student curricular resources and workshops to showcase innovative research and broaden the education of groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.

Human skeletal trauma represents direct evidence of conflict, making bioarchaeology, the study of human skeletal remains from archaeological contexts, well positioned to address the variability and significance of ritual violence in the archaeological record. The role of juveniles in such ritual contexts has been relatively understudied. Recently discovered skeletal assemblages suggest that such rituals played an important role in some past societies, yet the motivations for this remain unclear. The investigators hypothesize that individuals from outlying locations in a sociopolitical system were conscripted for ritual events as part of a strategy to maintain control over outlying regions. Continued excavations and biogeochemical analyses of bones and teeth from skeletal assemblagews will be used to test this hypothesis and better understand the ways in which past societies justified incorporation of juveniles in these events.

"This project will develop experimental and simulation methodology to elucidate the sensing and transcription mechanism of protein CueR from P. aeruginosa.  CueR binds to cellular Copper ions with very high affinity that leads to the binding of this protein to a specific site on DNA. This, in turn, activates the transcription of proteins that take the metal ion out of the cell to prevent toxicity and cell death. The results of this study will provide atomistic details of protein and DNA structure and conformational dynamics that enable the regulation of copper levels inside the cells of bacteria.  The project will also firm up an international collaboration and allow the continuation of a multi-pronged effort to enhance opportunities for under-represented groups to participate in science.  These include outreach to high-school students, providing access of Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (EPR) instrumentation to two primarily undergraduate institutions, the creation of new labs for undergraduate curriculum, and the graduate and undergraduate research training of a diverse group of students.

The project will generate a holistic understanding of the sensing and transcription mechanism of the copper metal sensor in bacteria. The project will develop methodology to site specifically label and model DNA with Cu2+-ions and develop techniques to measure site-specific dynamics using a novel Cu2+ label for proteins. In addition, point to point distances, elastic network modeling and molecular dynamics will be used to obtain structural information on the P. aeruginosa CueR protein and DNA in different functional states during the transcriptional cycle. Another centrally innovative aspect of this project is that the work will provide the wider biophysical community with new spin labeling and simulation approaches to measure structural constraints and flexibility in both DNA as well as proteins. This project is supported by the Molecular Biophysics and Genetic Mechanism Clusters of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in Biological Sciences Directorate.

"A significant fraction of the microbial biomass on Earth is found in the deep sea and subsurface, yet remarkably little is known about the molecular mechanisms of life under high hydrostatic pressures. This workshop aims to catalyze new interdisciplinary efforts to address this problem by bringing together researchers in deep life biology, extreme biophysics, structural biology, and X-ray instrumentation. The workshop will take place at Cornell University, which is home to the newly operational high-pressure biology beamlines (HP-Bio) at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. Topics covered will presume no prior knowledge of X-ray methods and will introduce new groups to high-pressure structural biology.   The workshop will provide unique educational opportunities with two days of hands-on tutorials on small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data analysis and high-pressure SAXS data collection. Cross-fertilization of ideas and skills will be promoted by a scientific program featuring a diverse group of experts. The participation of young scientists, members of underrepresented groups, and scientists who are new to this growing field will be encouraged and preference will be given to students, postdocs, and other early career investigators. Extremophiles play critical roles in our environment and possess unique abilities with potential for renewable energy and biotechnology applications. These organisms also provide a framework for understanding of how life may have originated on our planet and may exist elsewhere in our solar system. This workshop is funded by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biological Sciences Directorate and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.

"An award is made to Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey to develop a sensing platform to achieve rapid, broadband nanomechanical mapping of live cells. By integrating this sensing platform with a scanning probe microscope (SPM), time-elapsed nanomechanical evolutions of multiple cells on a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture can be mapped. Such a sensing platform can be used as a powerful tool in various biology studies to gain a better understanding of the correlation between molecular signaling and biomechanical physics in tissue remodeling. The research outcomes of this project will be disseminated through patent applications, technical demonstration and presentation in biological conferences, and journal publications.  Joint summer workshops will be organized to introduce nano/bio-mechanical sensing to both graduate and undergraduate students. Well-established programs at Rutgers such as the Rutgers Society for Women Engineers will be leveraged to recruit under-represented students including women and African American at both undergraduate and graduate levels, and to reach out to middle- and high- school students through open lab-tours. 

The research goal of this project is to achieve a wide variety of nanomechanical measurements of a 3D-cell culture, including rapid and broadband nanomechanical property mapping of multiple cells, mechanical stimulus and cell poking with precision force control, and simultaneous mechanical stimuli and mechanical measurement of cells. This research goal will be accomplished through the following four objectives: (I). A nano-manipulator with four degree-of-freedom (DOF) motions (two translational and two rotational) will be designed and built, and then integrated to a SPM system equipped with an inverted optical microscope. (II). A multi DOF nano-positioning stage will be designed and built to manipulate a cantilever probe, and integrated to the SPM system; (III). A suite of algorithms will be developed to integrate the above two manipulators with the SPM system to fulfill the desired cell stimuli and measurement functions; and (IV). The new sensing platform will be demonstrated and evaluated through time-elapsed viscoelasticity mapping of 3D cell culture in plant biology and cell biology benchmark experiments.

"Antimicrobial resistance, now considered a pressing public health concern, has propagated into the microbial communities of urban and natural environments around the world. Only recently has antimicrobial resistance been identified as an environmental contaminant and ecological concern; its impacts on wildlife and their environments remain relatively unknown. This doctoral dissertation project will characterize and quantify antimicrobial resistance in a primate species and its habitats, across different environmental conditions. Beyond contextualizing antimicrobial resistance in an endangered species and vulnerable landscape, this research will highlight the potential for transmission of resistant bacteria between hosts, including humans, and their environments. With far-reaching value for nonhuman primate conservation and husbandry, the results of this study will be shared with the scientific community (via collaborations, presentations, attendance of domestic and international conferences, and publications) and with the public (via science education and outreach).

Although revolutionary for modern society, the ubiquitous use of antibiotics has resulted in the rapid development of antimicrobial resistance genes that persist in bacterial genomes, can be transferred to other microbes, and may be proliferating environmental reservoirs of resistance. Animals can acquire resistant bacteria either through exposure to direct antibiotic administration (e.g., through veterinary care) or to environments contaminated with antibiotics or resistance bacteria. Once incorporated into host-associated communities, known as microbiomes, resistant bacteria disrupt the symbiotic roles of commensal microbes and diminish the host’s immune function. Current understanding about the transmission and impacts of resistance derives primarily from studies of humans and clinically prominent animal models (i.e., laboratory rodents). To better understand and combat the ubiquitous ‘resistance crisis’ on a more comprehensive scale, a broader, ecological framework is necessary. The Co-PI’s dissertation research is focused on assessing antimicrobial resistance as a novel facet of anthropogenic disturbance that differentially impacts lemurs living along a gradient of disturbance (i.e., ranging from minimally to greatly disturbed natural habitats and captive settings). Using next-generation sequencing techniques, this project has three specific aims: to determine the abundance of antimicrobial resistance in (1) the gut microbiome of lemurs, (2) representative environmental microbiomes (from soil and water) across the lemurs’ habitats, and (3) the gut microbiome of lemurs directly experiencing acute and cumulative antibiotic exposure. By studying varying disturbances in lemurs and their environments, we will determine specific sources of antimicrobial resistance and highlight the resistance crisis as an ecological and conservation concern with the potential to impact wildlife worldwide.

"Humans affect soils through agriculture in several ways: removing nutrients, altering ground surfaces, changing vegetation, and so on. By changing the soil, people are also changing the future potential of agriculture on those soils. This project uses Hawai'i Island as a model system to understand how centuries of farming has impacted the soils. Hawai'i is an excellent study system because of the diverse soil types created by the combination of different aged lava flows and broad rainfall gradients, and because of the diverse agricultural strategies Hawaiian farmers used on the different soils. Such studies are extremely important today as the world grapples with agricultural sustainability. By learning about agricultural adaptation and the long-term sustainability of indigenous agriculture we can learn how to maintain agriculturally sustainable soils. This project will also train a significant number of undergraduate and graduate students, including Native Hawaiians, and will engage middle and high school students in Hawai'i in learning about the history of social and agricultural practices of their home.

This project builds upon a foundation of soil pedogenesis work in Hawai'i and leverages the relatively short time frame of human occupation (approximately one millennia) to understand anthropogenic impacts on soils in their entirety. Project data will advance knowledge of soil pedogenesis and biogeochemistry while using interdisciplinary methods to quantify pre-industrial human impact on soils within a framework of niche construction. The overarching hypothesis is that niche agroecological construction of pre-industrial agriculture in Hawai'i was highly dependent on interaction with and feedback to the biogeochemical environment. The research team will pursue five specific aims: (1) use soil, elemental, and isotopic analysis to characterize and map natural soil biogeochemistry; (2) map agricultural strategies using mixed methods of plant micro-remains, historical documentation, remote sensing, and geospatial modeling; (3) document and quantify human alteration of soils and biogeochemical cycling through soil science and biogeochemical modeling; (4) create predictive geospatial models of agroecological forms based on biogeochemical drivers; and (5) further situate findings within the biocultural restoration of Native Hawaiian socioecosystems. This award was co-funded by the Ecosystem Science Cluster (BIO/DEB) and the Archaeology Program (SBE/BCS).

"In early life, organisms receive cues about their environment from their mother, specifically her hormones. But how offspring respond to these signals is not fully understood. This doctoral dissertation project will examine how the early-life environment and maternal “stress” hormones impact development in a long-lived, wild primate. In humans, high maternal stress can result in low offspring birth weight, which in turn predicts poor physiological status later in life. By studying a wild primate, this research will help identify why these connections exist and could inform interventions designed to help prevent negative outcomes. Additionally, this project will contribute to conservation and education at the research site and surrounding areas, through frequent presentations to local community members, tourists, and park management officials. The co-PI will also continue to mentor undergraduate women in the laboratory throughout her dissertation.

When faced with adversity, mammalian mothers have fewer resources to invest in their offspring. These mothers also experience higher levels of “stress” hormones. These hormones, through the placenta and breastmilk, can reach the offspring and indicate the mother’s divestment, potentially leading to adjusted offspring development in response to these signals. There are two possible adjustments that can occur in offspring: 1) a delay in all aspects of development, or 2) trade-offs in development, for example favoring growth over investment in the immune system. Using non-invasive fecal hormone samples, this project will first identify the social and ecological factors of the environment that result in higher maternal stress hormones. Next, using behavioral observations, the researchers will examine if maternal stress levels impact maternal behavior towards their offspring. Lastly, the researchers will non-invasively assess four aspects of offspring development (growth rate, motor skill acquisition, time to independence, and immune function) to determine if offspring respond to maternal stress hormones by delaying all developmental markers or by making trade-offs.

"Methane-producing archaea (methanogens) are “extremophiles”, organisms that thrive under conditions at the limit of life on Earth. Methanogens are unique organisms that grow by producing methane gas which can be harvested for electricity, heat, and transportation fuel. The project will study the biochemistry of a large multi-enzyme complex, akin to a “redox router” switch that has the ability to direct carbon towards either biomass or methane synthesis depending on the energy status of the cell. To the researchers' knowledge this is the first such biological router switch described in any organism that directly integrates energy conservation to biomass synthesis in one enzyme complex. The principal investigator will determine the ratio of enzymes in the complex, identify sites of interaction, and ascertain if the complex changes composition in response to growth substrate. A postdoctoral researcher and graduate students will be trained in the biochemical mechanisms of biological methane production.  Research will be shared using hands-on educational modules through the Women in Science and other K-12 outreach activities. This research has the potential to enhance bio-methane production for renewable energy, mitigate methane production in the environment, and engineer methanogens to produce useful chemicals through synthetic biology.

Previous work has shown that enzymes in the Wolfe Cycle (CoM-S-S-CoB heterodisulfide reductase, Hdr) and Wood-Ljungdahl CO2 fixation pathways (the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase Cdh, subunit of the acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase, ACDS; and methylene tetrahydromethanopterin reductase, Mer) form a multienzyme complex in the methanogen Methanosarcina acetivorans. The goal of the project is to determine if methanogens adjust Cdh/Hdr/Mer complex stoichiometry in response to growth substrate switching. The hypothesis is that methanogenic growth kinetics of M. acetivorans is dependent on the formation and stoichiometry of the terminal oxidoreductase Hdr with the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (Cdh) of the ACDS complex. Molecular, biochemical, and biophysical techniques will be used to detect and characterize multienzyme complexes that form in vitro and in vivo. Enzyme complex composition and subunit exchange kinetics will be assessed in relation to growth substrate, and the effect of deletion and overexpression of enzyme complex components on cell physiology will be measured. In vivo and in vitro crosslinking mass spectrometry will be employed to map protein interaction interfaces which will then be used to model the router complex using crystal structures of homologous subunits. Subunit stoichiometries will be manipulated and their effect on growth rate, product yield, and metabolic efficiency of cells will be determined. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers from underrepresented groups will be trained in anaerobic microbiology, redox biochemistry, and synthetic biology techniques. Research will be disseminated through publications, presentations, and outreach activities such as the popular Women in Science workshop.

"Modern humans expanded into nearly every region of the world, adapting both culturally and biologically to a range of natural environments. Past research in human skeletal biology has shown that the human limb skeleton shifts toward a shorter, more robust morphology in cold-adapted populations and a taller, less robust morphology in heat-adapted populations. This doctoral dissertation project will examine how evolutionary processes have shaped this diversity in the human limb skeleton through changes in growth and development (ontogeny). The project will directly address the relationship between different evolutionary forces and changes in growth trajectories, advancing knowledge about biological mechanisms underpinning human morphological adaptations and plasticity. Reconstructed 3D surface renderings from computed tomography (CT) scans and other data generated from this project will be shared freely to facilitate further research and the development of online teaching materials. In addition, the project will promote undergraduate mentoring and training, as well as national and international collaborations through conferences, seminars and workshops with partner institutions.

Past studies have shown that adaptation by natural selection to climatic conditions, neutral (non-selective) evolution, and non-heritable change in response to climatic conditions (phenotypic plasticity) may all play important roles in shaping the diverse morphological patterns observed in the human limb skeleton. In addition, studies on juvenile skeletons have shown that these morphological patterns are evident at young ages. When and how these different evolutionary forces influence limb shape and size during growth remain unclear. This project uses a global sample of osteometric measurements taken from bone specimens of archaeological populations and 3D modules reconstructed from CT scans of contemporary population to tease apart these different evolutionary forces. The investigator will use a range of statistical methods and models to address whether: 1) selection on body size during growth will have different effects on limb morphology, 2) neutral evolutionary forces can account for some of the divergence in growth trajectories in addition to climatic adaptation, and 3) selection acts primarily on adults, juvenile individuals, or both.

"Molecules can be detected and identified by how they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths. A technique called Raman spectroscopy reveals information about molecular structure using the light scattered by molecules as they vibrate at their unique frequencies. Over 40 years ago, it was discovered that the Raman scattering signals could be increased dramatically (more than a million times) when molecules were stuck to (adsorbed on) a roughened metal surface. That discovery improved chemical detection and analysis, however the signal improvements are not always reproducible from one surface to another and the precise reason for the enhancement is still under vigorous debate. In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms-A (CSDM-A) Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Xi Ling of Boston University is investigating signal enhancements in Raman spectroscopy on the surfaces of well-defined, two-dimensional (2D) crystals (e.g., tin sulfide (SnS2) and tungsten selenide (WSe2)). The structure and properties of these crystals are better defined and understood than those of roughened metal surfaces and thus, Professor Ling and her students may uncover how and why Raman signal are enhanced on surfaces.  New technologies are expected to emerge from this research project, especially in the field of chemical analysis, where it may become routine to detect just a few or even a single molecule of a substance. The students engaged in this project are gaining advanced training in spectroscopy (light-matter interactions) and molecular and materials design, both of which are increasingly sought-after areas of expertise in the science and technology sector.  Professor Ling will develop and implement a laser spectroscopy experience for students by collaborating with Boston University's Learning Resource Network (LERNet) and its outreach programs. This outreach program encourages young women and high schools students to enter science and engineering fields. Dr. Lin will also enhance open source education resources for high school teachers and students by developing interactive video lesson modules. 

The mechanisms of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) are not fully understood, especially the chemical mechanism (CM), which remains relatively mysterious compared to the electromagnetic (EM) mechanism. The scientific objectives of this project are to gain a deeper understanding of chemical mechanism and explore the potential of 2D crystals to overcoming the key problem of reproducibility of SERS in practical applications. Quantitative SERS data from well-defined samples (both 2D substrate and adsorbed analytes) serve to test the CM theory in the literature. The Ling group is employing multiple analytical approaches, such as wavelength-scanned Raman measurements, micro-absorption spectroscopy, as well as rigorous group theory analysis to understand the origin of the chemical enhancement in a quantitative manner. Furthermore, toward the development of revolutionary SERS-sensing techniques, 2D crystal/metal systems are being investigated to understand how the 2D crystals influence the plasmon frequency and electromagnetic field distribution of metal nanostructures and demonstrate the high sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility of the system in micro-sensing. Collectively, these investigations are providing a deeper understanding of the controversial CM in SERS and guide an innovative design of a better SERS platform. The broader technical impacts of this work include new knowledge of CM in SERS and the seeding of development of new technique for chemical and bio-sensing.  The education plan improves the quality, retention, and diversity of STEM students in science and technology.

"PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY

Ready access to clean water is a pressing global challenge that represents one of the most important sustainability issues we face as a society. Desalination of sea water and wastewater remediation/reuse are two prevalent solutions that will benefit from new advances in basic materials research. These approaches to generating clean water for consumption rely on the use of membranes endowed with material properties designed to optimize separations performance. This research project focuses on new state-of-the-art polymeric materials designed to address key limitations that must be overcome to further advance understanding and efficacy of materials used in membrane-based separations. The objectives are to design and advance the use of block polymer materials for membranes using a combination of contemporary polymer synthesis, thorough materials characterization, and integration of new macromolecules into practical separation membranes. The research promises to benefit society through the eventual development of new technologies that render water purification and remediation more economical and more widely accessible. Membranes will play important roles in a sustainable water future and the fundamental underpinnings achieved in this work will help solidify the foundations from which new technologies will be built. The work will also build diverse STEM talent though partnerships that include the NorthStar STEM Alliance, American Chemical Society’s Project SEED, and the University of Minnesota's Science for All group.


PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY

The research work centers around the design, development, and deployment of block polymer centric strategies that rely on the self-assembly of novel compounds to take advantage of their nanostructured morphologies. Co-continuous nanostructures are essential to advance the design of materials for next-generation water purification membranes, and this research will advance knowledge useful for the creation of co-continuous nanostructured polymer materials that are useful for aqueous-based separations. The essential feature of the program emphasizes the preparation of materials with co-continuous nanostructures by capitalizing on the disordered state of block polymer derived materials. The work will advance knowledge in two main categories. The first is based on a thermodynamic approach that entails trapping a disordered co-continuous morphology in the thermodynamically stable disordered state using pre-formed block polymers. The second is based on a kinetic approach that entails trapping the disordered state during the in-situ synthesis of block polymers in a system that is conducive to chemical fixation through crosslinking. The fundamental and basic research efforts will advance knowledge in these two arenas, will contribute to the basic understanding of block polymer thermodynamics, and will ultimately allow for new technologies to be built that contribute to sustainable access to clean water.

"Precision medicine efforts aim to tailor healthcare to individuals by devising the most effective treatments based on genetic profiles.  But how are these efforts implemented within genetically diverse populations who nonetheless share perceived common ethnicities?  This project investigates these issues within the context of the Latinx population, which is very diverse genetically, but is one that the medical community often mischaracterizes as they provide research reports, recruit medical study participants and devise public educational materials.  The project analyzes how precision medicine investigators think about and act upon attributes of the Latinx population as a target community.  It will analyze the approaches, logics, and frameworks used to make sense of group identity.  It will also investigate how these factors may contribute to racialized concepts of human difference among and within populations.  More broadly, the project considers how the concepts of biology and race might affect broader political understandings and processes pertaining to Latinx people, and thus provides input to policy makers in medical communities and beyond as they strive to acknowledge and support racial diversity in the United States.  

We know that racialized concepts of human, and therefore genomic, differences persist in biomedicine, yet the relevance of race and ethnicity in genomics is contested. Focusing on Latinx populations for precision medicine presents a paradox because the Latinx label is a broad one that nonetheless contains strong diversity in genetic profiles. The first study phase will be a content analysis of 100 precision medicine texts, such as research reports, public education materials, and participant recruitment materials, which reflect racial and ethnic identities of participants, data, or bio-specimens.  The second study phase will include ethnographic observations at 15-20 precision medicine events as well as in-depth key-informant interviews with a target of 40 precision medicine investigators.  Finally, the project will conduct semi-structured interviews with 60 Latinx community members relating to genomics, precision medicine and Latinx identity.  Through examination of investigator and research participant perspectives, this study will address how social categorizations are constructed in biomedicine and in contemporary life more broadly. Findings from the project will provide insight into sociological theories regarding how social categorizations are engaged, reinforced, and/or constructed in biomedicine; it will also inform sociological theories of racial identity and medical practice.

"Proteins are the 'workhorse' molecules of life, they participate in nearly every activity that cells carry out. It follows that understanding protein structure and function is essential to understanding life processes, and how to control or modify them. Biochemistry and biophysics experiments give the most accurate data on protein structure and function, but the experiments are often expensive and too specialized for many of the cell and molecular biologists focused on a particular interesting protein. This means that reliable computational predictions of protein structure and function are in high demand. These techniques are also specialized but can be automated, which is the focus of this project, which aims to develop an integrated platform for high-resolution protein structure prediction and structure-based function annotation that is accessible from the Web. This resource will significantly enhance studies of individual proteins as well as processes in cellular biology and other biological sciences. Through the collaboration of the two institutions, students at NCAT will learn state of the art high performance computing methods, and workshops at both institutions will provide greater understanding of the capabilities of the new resource. 

Proteins are complex components of biological systems, and studies on their structure and function often require multiple approaches to measurement or modeling. Many of the advanced computer algorithms used in this modeling are highly specialized, involving a number of complicated processes for each aspect of the protein modeling. Biologists whose primary interest is the final result often cannot determine which algorithm or pipeline to choose, how to enter parameters, or how to interpret the resulting models. While continuing to improve the accuracy of the core algorithms in protein structure prediction and structure-based function annotation, this project will also make improvements to domain parsing and assembly, to improve the quality of complex protein structure and function modeling. Another major focus of this project is to develop new protocols that automatically guide protein targets to the most suitable pipelines. In conjunction with this there will be new confidence scoring systems, both global and local, to assist biological users as they interpret the modeling results. In addition, advanced parallel computing and graphic processor unit techniques will be implemented in order to accelerate the pipelines and reduce user's waiting time.  New opportunities will be made for improving educational outcomes, in particular for women and minority students, in both University of Michigan and the North Carolina A&T State University.

"Reconstructing the movements and interactions of humans in the past informs our broader understanding of the biological and cultural processes that have shaped human populations through time. In this doctoral dissertation project, the investigator will compare two methods used to reconstruct human population dynamics in the past based on skeletal data. Understanding the relative merits of these biological methods will support more complex analyses that rely on both biological and cultural data from past populations. The interdisciplinary project draws upon theory and methods from evolutionary anthropology, genetics, statistics, and bioarchaeology. Through free and low-cost courses and outreach talks, a broad audience, including members of descendant communities, interested members of the public, and underserved students in STEM fields, will engage in discussions about the complexities of human population dynamics and the relevance of these processes in the modern world. 

The project will investigate two methods for identifying signatures of gene flow from osteological data, in order to address larger questions about the social, cultural and biological aspects of population interactions in the past. The two methods compared in this study determine the presence of gene flow by looking at two of its potential effects: a greater degree of similarity in morphology between groups (the biological distance model), and an increase in group morphological variation (the quantitative genetic model). The study will address three primary research questions: Does the inference of gene flow differ between studies using two different models to investigate the same skeletal remains? Are important nuances about group interactions captured using one biological method that are not inferable from the other, or do both methods need to be used together to achieve better resolution about gene flow? And finally, how does each method compare to hypotheses of migration established from material culture? These questions will be addressed by comparing the results of two analyses in two different archaeological contexts within a region with a well-researched archaeological record. The first context has evidence from material culture that is indicative of past migration (and possible gene flow) between groups, and the second has material culture evidence indicating cultural separation and likely no gene flow. Through these tests, the investigators will evaluate the ability of individual models to estimate gene flow in contexts with no written records.

"The classification of species based on skeletal morphology (shape) often has been focused on characteristics of the cranium (skull). However, research has also begun to address the taxonomic signal of other parts of the skeleton. This doctoral dissertation project will use state-of-the art 3D scanning technology to provide a systematic taxonomic assessment of the cranium and numerous post-cranial skeletal elements among closely related species of macaques. Macaques are an ideal model system because they are geographically widespread, there are numerous species, and they occupy a wide range of dietary and climatic niches. The results will provide novel insights into which aspects of skeletal morphology best reflect the genetic relationships of macaques, as well as which bones best reflect dietary, locomotor, and environmental differences among species. Findings in extant primates also will inform the study of fossil species where genetic information is typically not available. The research advances the career of a female scientist, and results will be disseminated to K-12 students from historically underrepresented groups. In addition, 3D models will be used to educate students about how animals with different morphologies adapt to their environments. Public outreach also will be achieved through blog posts, workshops, and seminar presentations.

This project seeks to determine if morphological data inferred from the skeleton tracks genetic distances, and therefore, can be a useful tool for species assessment. Skeletons of the relatively specious and geographically widespread macaque will be used to test the hypotheses that (1) taxonomy can be accurately predicted based on morphological patterns, and (2) post-cranial elements may reflect taxonomy at the same level, or better than, the skull. Data will consist of 3D morphometric analyses of eight macaque species and three non-macaque out-groups, each chosen for their diverse genetic, geographic and behavioral relatedness. In cases where bones do not follow the pattern expected by genetics, additional statistical analyses will be performed to test the extent to which skeletal morphology is driven by climatic, dietary or locomotor differences between species. The outcomes of this research will include a large dataset of 3D bone scans from a single primate genus, which will be publicly shared. Moreover, the results will provide an important bridge between the analysis of living primate species and extinct fossil species for which only fragmentary skeletal morphology is known.

"The growth and development of the human skeleton is affected by the way it is used across the life course.  In order to understand how human skeletal development evolved, it is useful to study skeletal development in other closely related primates. The goal of this doctoral dissertation project is to investigate how changes in locomotion across the chimpanzee life course are reflected in the skeleton. Chimpanzees change from moving mostly in the trees when they are young to moving more on the ground as they age, providing an opportunity to examine how chimpanzee trabecular (spongy) and cortical (compact) bone are modified as locomotion changes across the life course. The research will contribute to our understanding of bone biology, specifically the sensitivity of the skeleton to changes in movement throughout life, which can be used to better reconstruct the locomotion of extinct fossil apes and humans, particularly the evolution of terrestriality. This research will be used in K-12 science outreach and exhibited at natural history museums. CT scans and 3D prints of Pan troglodytes and fossil hominoids (apes) will also be part of an international exhibit focused on ape evolution and conservation. All CT scans generated from this project will be shared with the museums where the data were collected, furthering scientific access and inquiry. 

Bones are a crucial source of data from the fossil record because they undergo modification in response to the mechanical loads placed upon them during movement (e.g. walking, running, climbing). However, most studies to date focus on either trabecular or cortical bone and not the two together in one study. Chimpanzees modify how they move through their life, shifting from more arboreal to more terrestrial substrates from infancy to adulthood. Thus, if the skeleton is responding to these changes, the investigators hypothesize that these transitions will be detectable in trabecular and cortical bone. This study will also address whether both bone types respond to locomotor changes during development, and will apply these findings to other species, extant and fossil, to help in recovering patterns of movement and substrate usage. These questions will be addressed using microCT scans of trabecular bone in the fore- and hindlimb as well as pQCT scans of cortical bone in the shaft of the femur, tibia, humerus, and radius. The prediction is that trabecular and cortical bone at each life history stage will reflect the locomotor behaviors used at that time. By further studying the relationship between ontogenetic changes in behavior and cortical and trabecular bone structure, novel anatomical proxies sensitive to loading patterns may be identified and used to reconstruct the locomotor repertoires of fossil apes and humans.

"The gut microbiome is the community of bacteria that resides in the gastrointestinal tract, and past research has demonstrated that this community is physiologically important to its host. However, researchers do not yet fully understand why the gut microbiome varies so much from individual to individual. This doctoral dissertation project will examine how social behaviors such as physical proximity and infant care-giving affect gut microbiome transmission among adult and infant individuals in a wild primate population. This research will therefore advance fundamental knowledge about microbiome variation in a non-human primate and may also inform microbiome research in humans. The project will facilitate the completion of a doctoral degree by a woman in science, contribute to the training of multiple undergraduate students in scientific laboratory and field methods, and engage young women and other underrepresented groups in STEM through public outreach. In addition, the work will provide wildlife education to local school children, ecotourists, tour guides, and field assistants near the research site through training and public outreach, which will increase local human resource capacity and aid in the conservation of a critically endangered primate species. 

A mounting body of evidence suggests that the gut microbiome is an important phenotypic trait in understanding human biological variation and well-being. However, we still lack a necessary understanding of the factors that shape phenotypic and developmental plasticity in this trait. A primary factor affecting variation in the gut microbiome that remains unclear is the longitudinal effect of social environment on the composition of the gut microbiome. Further, we do not understand how socially-mediated transmission affects the assembly of the gut microbiome during development, which is a critical window thought to have long-reaching effects later in life. The primate model system allows examination of how the gut microbiome changes with shifting social dynamics because adult female social bonds are known to fluctuate following infant births and infants receive variable amounts of social contact via allomaternal care (caretaking behaviors by individuals other than the mother). Using a combination of detailed behavioral data and microbial DNA sequencing in longitudinally collected fecal samples, this research will determine the effect size of social transmission of gut microbes among socially interacting adult females and between allomothers and infants.

"There is currently a lack of information on SARS-Cov-2 particle stability in varied environmental conditions. This project will create mechanistic insight which will estimate the persistence of infectious particles and is critical for predictions of viral spread as well as informing public health. Two graduate students will collaborate during these experiments. This work will form a substantial part of the graduate thesis for these students. Measurements of structural limits of viral particles using atomic force microscopy and holographic optical tweezers will also inform our general knowledge of the viral envelope stability as applied to other enveloped viruses.

The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) virus poses an acute and novel public health crisis. The knowledge gained from the proposed work will immediately inform the projections of viral survivability under various environmental conditions. The measurements will also establish complete and efficient workflow for handling SARS-CoV-2 particles with advanced optical trapping and atomic force microscopy techniques. The technical expertise gained will be valuable in case similar measurements would be required under the highest bio-safety environments (BL4 condition) with live virions.

"This dissertation explores how human biological variation influenced the risk of death and survival in a major influenza pandemic. The researchers examine human skeletal remains of people who died during an influenza pandemic to understand how frailty (defined as the increased likelihood of disease and death) and resilience impacted the risk of mortality. In addition to increasing scientific knowledge of biological vulnerability, this project will help researchers understand how social norms create  inequalities that directly impact health and mortality. The researchers will collect public health data on underrepresented groups, creating valuable information on how influenza incidence and severity may vary in marginalized populations. This project will therefore contribute to the goals of Healthy People 2020, a government initiative to improve the health of all Americans. This project will identify risk factors that increased a person’s risk of dying in a past influenza pandemic, helping scientists predict how a future influenza outbreak may affect modern populations. This research will provide a female first-generation college student with training in a STEM field, laboratory methods, and statistics, as well as additional opportunities for her to collaborate with scholars in other fields.

It seems obvious that a person who is frail should always be more likely to die than someone who is healthy and resilient. However, during the Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918, young adults between the ages of 20-40 were among the most likely to die. There are many theories as to why seemingly healthy young adults died in record numbers during this pandemic, however no one has questioned whether the young people were actually healthy. Was there some underlying frailty in these individuals or was the pandemic truly killing resilient people? This project will explore the factors that influenced mortality and survival in the 1918 pandemic by answering the following questions: 1) Were frail individuals more likely to die during the Spanish Influenza pandemic? 2) Were more resilient individuals more likely to survive the Spanish Influenza pandemic? 3) Do demographic factors such as age, sex, and race influence frailty and resilience? Human skeletal remains from the Hamann-Todd collection, an assemblage of individuals who died in Cleveland, Ohio, during the 1918 pandemic will be examined for skeletal markers of frailty and resilience. These data will be analyzed using a type of statistical analyses called hazards analysis that shows how the risk of death changes over time in response to certain circumstances. The results will show how the risk of death varied during the pandemic in individuals who were frail versus those who were resilient.

"This doctoral dissertation project will examine the quantity and path of nerves that run through the jaws and teeth of mammals to establish if the size of these nerves is related to diet. The investigator will focus on humans and non-human primates, to determine if different diets correspond to the concentration of soft tissues (like nerves, arteries, and veins) in specific sections of the mouth and teeth. The research will advance knowledge about the relationships between soft tissues, bony tissues, jaw function, and diet, and may also inform our understanding of craniomandibular plasticity in modern humans. The project will support undergraduate and graduate STEM training, create an open, online database of scan data, and be used in a variety of science outreach projects and blog posts aimed at K-12 and general public audiences. 

Primates use sensory mechanisms to choose foods based on color, taste, size, and texture. These sensory mechanisms are controlled by nerves in the skin, eyes, mouth, teeth, and other structures that allow a primate to determine if a food is safe for eating. The primary nerves that supply sensation to the mouth are branches of the trigeminal nerve that pass through the maxilla and mandible. Previous research indicates that larger nerves relay more sensory information at faster speeds, suggesting that it is important to know the size of nerves to understand their functions. It has also been established that primate diets are intimately tied to tooth shape and chewing function, suggesting that the properties of teeth and their accompanying nerves are selected for simultaneously in relation to how they sense the properties (i.e., toughness, stiffness) of foods. The proposed work will use microCT scanning and iodine staining methods to examine the relationship between tooth shape and the nerves of teeth, with a focus on how these structures vary in relation to primate diets. Teeth of primates that are adapted to leaf- or insect-eating are predicted to need more nerves in the back of the mouth (under the molars), while fruit-eating primates are expected to have more nerves at the front of the mouth. This hypothesis is supported by data showing that individuals eating tougher diets manipulate food objects within their mouth more than individuals that consume softer food objects. This manipulation is partly due to how primates use nerves to assess material properties of an object to ensure that the individual does not damage their teeth during chewing.

"This project develops science-driven modeling and decision-making algorithms for precision agriculture, with associated cloud-based implementations.  This project would increase the potential for more efficient agricultural systems through the development of more accurate and larger scale models, data collection, and ultimately a software infrastructure that farmers could use for real-time monitoring of their crops.     

The project is derived from scientific questions in sustainable agriculture, sensor networks, decision sciences, data science, and machine learning. The primary innovations are applications of grid-based soil parameters using incomplete data, machine learning-based time series analysis, and optimization problems to estimate the optimal mix of inputs for nutrients and irrigation. These applications are likely to have wide usage among the precision agriculture community.  The cyberinfrastructure, MyGeoHub, is a cloud-based service that users can access through web browsers and leverages an existing infrastructure.

"This project seeks to fundamentally change how people live their everyday lives towards a more environmentally responsible and sustainable future and has the potential to play a major role in reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and combating climate change. This research will help enable individuals to reduce their personal energy usage in indoor commercial building settings by providing real-time visibility into the energy cost of each action. This will enable energy-accountability in commercial buildings by providing actionable recommendations with quantifiable savings, as well as insights for both occupants and building managers so that they can act in a timely manner. These small savings can add up: even a small 1% reduction in commercial building energy consumption translates to 1.5 billion dollars of annual savings for the nation. This project will help advance research at the intersection of building-scale systems, Internet-of-Things, wearable systems, and recommender systems. Course modules developed on embedded systems, mobile computing, Internet-of-Things, and deep reinforcement learning will be used to train undergraduate and graduate students.

This proposal aims to significantly reduce energy consumption in commercial buildings by examining each occupant’s unique and individualized energy usage, or “energy footprint”, and providing occupants with actionable and measurable energy-saving recommendations. The proposed system comprises of several components, including real-time sensing and actuation, building energy monitoring, indoor localization, large-scale time-series data analytics, and recommender systems. This project is organized into three research thrusts: (1) develop a digital twin model of a commercial building to simulate energy savings from human-driven actions, and research efficient algorithms for computing each occupant’s “energy footprint” in shared environments. (2) advance knowledge in deep reinforcement learning and design a recommender system to discover actions that have the best potential for saving energy while adapting to user preferences. (3) investigate effective feedback mechanisms and incentive schemes to encourage energy saving behaviors, increase recommendation quality, and improve recommendation acceptance rate.

Research results, including datasets, embedded hardware designs, software code, simulators, smartphone application code, reports, presentations, and papers will be shared with the research community through the research group website and GitHub. To ensure privacy, any personally identifiable information in datasets will be removed. To encourage deployment and experimentation by others, documented open-source software and hardware will be release and maintain in the project’s GitHub repository at https://github.com/Columbia-ICSL/EnergyFootprinting for at least five years.

"Understanding the brain in the context of its interactions with the world is key to assessing its dynamics in health and disease states. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology is able to track blood-oxygen-level dependent signals over time and serve as a proxy to neural activity. Current approaches have limitations, as they assume that the interdependence between distinct brain regions is constant throughout recording periods. These approaches also assume that the brain is an isolated system that does not consider outside stimulus. To capture the highly complex dynamics and to enable the understanding of the neural basis of human cognition this research project will develop new data analysis methods for processing brain activity to explain the relationships involved in attention, learning, memory, decision-making, and language. This multidisciplinary effort will also enable the training of a new generation of engineers and clinicians, with particular emphasis on underrepresented groups, who can use the new data analytics to aid them during decision-making to assess the brain’s health enabling earlier diagnostics. The results of this research will have a great impact on healthcare and benefit the U.S. economy and society.
 
To capture the highly complex spatiotemporal brain activity, this grant supports development of a model-based approach that captures the non-stationarity and fractal behavior of the brain dynamics. As a consequence, it will unveil dynamical characteristics that can be used to quantitatively and qualitatively measure how well an individual is doing in a particular task (e.g., attention/memory). Furthermore, the model-based approach in this project lays down the framework to perform control where quantitative measures can be used to establish control objectives regarding success in performing a given task. Unlike currently employed short-range memory models, this project focuses on a generalized mathematical framework that captures the degree of a memory of brain activity. Thus, the research will provide new insights and information about the brain organization and cognition that may fundamentally change the way one examines neuro-related data.

"Antennas are key components of ubiquitous wireless communication, radar, and navigation systems that affect widespread societal needs, such as aerospace systems, healthcare, and space exploration. Most of the antennas used in a variety of applications including cellular phones to unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are based on flat planar structures or wire geometries that are developed using traditional manufacturing technique. This approach does not allow designers the opportunity to fully leverage the geometry, space, and materials available to design better performing antennas. The focus of this CARRER development project is on an emerging antenna fabrication technique that combines additive manufacturing (AM) and pulsed laser machining that has the potentials to fundamentally alter the existing state of the art. The proposed research will allow engineers to implement smaller, efficient, lighter, and reconfigurable antenna embodiments in three-dimensions (3D) for future applications with increasing complexity.  The research proposed in this project is fully integrated with an education and outreach plan. The educational plan will impact the next generation of professionals by exposing high school students to hands-on activities and videos to explain basic antenna engineering concepts. The videos will be made by accomplished engineers in the engineering field to have a strong role-model-based motivational component to stimulate them to pursue STEM careers. An advanced cellular phone-based teaching tool that allows engineering undergraduate students to visualize complex 3D concepts in electromagnetics and antenna engineering is also proposed. 
The overall goal of this project is to pursue the discovery of the next generation of antennas with reconfigurable performance while conserving size, weight and cost. Research initiatives include: (a) the investigation of novel additive manufacturing processes for the fabrication of conformal 3D multiple curved antennas based on laser-enhanced direct print AM (LE-DPAM) with femtosecond laser machining and 5-axis kinematics, (b) the study of bio-inspired 3D superior antenna geometries that are not possible to manufacture using traditional methods but are conceivable using LE-DPAM, (c) the development of design methods based on a novel 3D to 2D conformal mapping technique, (d) the study of embedded material- and IC-based reconfigurability mechanisms including the use of electrically tunable inks that can be deposited on conformal surfaces, as well as IC-based switches for reconfiguration of antenna feeds and loads, and (e) the investigation of the structure-property relationships of commercially available and custom-formulated inks that provide excellent electromagnetic performance while addressing the  needs for aviation and space environments.

"Continually rising cost of healthcare and side-effects of drugs, such as opioid addiction, could be reduced through remote health monitoring systems and closed-loop electroceuticals, which rely on large amount of data continuously traveling around human body from low-energy wearable and implantable sensors to an on-body hub then to the cloud. Today's standard technologies rely on electromagnetic wave for communication around the human body, which is not physically secure and consume orders of magnitude more power than needed by a typical sensor node, making the communication link the energy bottleneck for ultra-low-power body sensor nodes.  This research project will lead to a fundamentally new way of thinking about using human body as a ""wire"" to achieve orders of magnitude lower energy used for communication around the human body while being physically secure (i.e., signals cannot be snooped without physical contact). In addition, this project will use edge-analytics to reduce data volume for efficient Human-Intranet smart sensor nodes. The project will develop the fundamental understanding for designing the smallest (less than one cubic millimeter) body-connected node for connected healthcare.  With simulation tools and hardware verification, backed by concrete mathematical model development, this work will open new research directions in Human-Intranet for Healthcare, Human-Computer Interaction and Brain-Machine Interfaces. The outcome of this research will be integrated with undergraduate and graduate courses on Digital Design and Mixed-Signal Design. Mathematical models representing circuit/system level information and energy trade-off will be disseminated through research website. Such experimentally verified models are expected to provide significant impact by serving a broad community of students, researchers, and engineers. Educational prototypes of the research will be used to engage students in educational workshops. The strong engagement through undergraduate research mentorship and minority student mentorship will strengthen the interest of science and technology from underrepresented students.  

The objective of this research is to transform data communication around the human body by using the human body as a wire to achieve orders of magnitude reduction in communication energy in the body area network and combining it with in-sensor analytics to reduce data volume without significant reduction in information to further improve energy/information efficiency. The project will develop the foundations of energy-efficient and physically secured network of energy-sparse sensor nodes for Human-Intranet. The research exploits the low-loss human body channel itself to power the sensor, perform edge-analytics to compress the data and extract information before transferring the compressed data using the same low-loss human body channel. The body-wire research is expected to solve the problem of high data traffic by achieving >1000x reduction in energy/information, allowing longer-lasting, smarter, smaller (new form-factors, better patient compliance), and lower cost healthcare. The energy reduction and improved physical security (in addition to encryption) will open possibilities of many new sensor nodes with new form factors (e.g., connected patch) for human-centered healthcare networks. Along with developing bio-physical circuit models for human body as a communication medium, optimized transceiver circuits and systems for lossy broadband electro-quasistatic human body channel will be developed and demonstrated through integrated circuit fabrication and measurement. A system-on-chip with sensing, in-sensor analytics, and human-body-communication transceiver will be designed, fabricated, and measured to demonstrate the end-to-end improvement in energy/information efficiency. The project will develop mathematical models verified by experiments for future design space exploration and information/energy analysis for Human-Intranet. If successful, the project will develop the fundamental understanding of designing the smallest body-connected node for connected healthcare.

"In this doctoral dissertation project, the investigator will use whole genome sequencing to examine how genetic networks encompassing hundreds of genes involved in regulating social behavior have evolved across sifakas, a behaviorally and ecologically diverse group of lemurs. This research will provide new insights about the genomic contributions to social behavioral evolution, and advance knowledge about the complex interplay of genetics, ecology, and the social environment in shaping primate behavior. The project may inform public health research, as some genetic pathways investigated in this project have also been implicated in the development and expression of various psychiatric illnesses. The project will also support primate conservation efforts, research and training opportunities, and research infrastructure at the study locations. The investigator will make all of their data publicly available, thereby providing additional research opportunities beyond the scope of this project. 

Many previous studies into the influences of genetics on social behavior have focused on examining single or few candidate genes and often only protein-coding portions of those genes. Here the researchers will take a whole genome sequencing approach to holistically examine the evolution of genomic regions involved in the development and expression of social behavior (i.e. ""sociogenomic"" regions) in sifakas. The researchers will generate a whole genome sequence for each of the eight sifaka species without a current reference genome. They will also sequence a woolly lemur individual to be able to identify genetic sequences that are unique to sifakas. Subsequently, they will subset the whole genome sequences to sociogenomic regions and examine their evolution. The researchers will specifically examine: (1) Whether sociogenomic regions have been significantly conserved across sifakas, indicative of evolutionary constraint (2) Evidence of selection acting on protein-coding portions of sociogenomic regions relative to differences in sifaka social and ecological environments and (3) The presence of accelerated evolution occurring in regions potentially involved in regulating the expression of sociogenomic genes.

"Many modern scientific fields, such as astrophysics, bio-informatics, finance, forensics, social science, and others generate massive amounts of data that are both high-dimensional and non-standard. For example, the data may have structure such as graphs, functions, strings, and sets, but is not Euclidean. To analyze these data sets and address various statistical applications arising in these fields, efficient learning and inference procedures that can handle high-dimensional and non-standard data are needed. The functional analytic paradigm involving reproducing kernels, also known as the kernel method, provides a unified framework to handle such data and has been applied to a variety of non-parametric statistical problems with great empirical success by the machine learning community. However, its theoretical understanding in terms of statistical optimality has been limited, and computationally it scales poorly to large data. The key focus of this project is to explore various foundational research questions associated with the kernel method to achieve a statistically optimal and computationally efficient paradigm that can handle high-dimensional non-standard data. This research will significantly impact scientific development in all areas of science and engineering that intersect with statistics, and will be integrated with the PI's  educational activities of mentoring students, developing new courses and forging new collaborations. Methods and code developed under this project will be made publicly available for ready use. 

The core idea behind the kernel method is to map the observed data (could be high-dimensional and non-standard) to exotic function space, called the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and apply the standard methods developed for Euclidean data on the mapped data. Ironically, the RKHS is usually higher dimensional (even infinite-dimensional) than the dimensionality of the observed data, and is characterized by a kernel function called the reproducing kernel. The main advantage of the kernel method is its ability to explore nonlinear relationships in data by simply exploring linear relationships between the mapped elements in the RKHS through the kernel function. Despite its superior empirical performance, the statistical theory of learning algorithms based on the kernel method is not well understood except in a few cases such as classification, non-parametric least square regression, principal component analysis and goodness-of-fit testing. In tise project, the PI will explore various foundational research questions associated with the kernel method and associated learning algorithms to address this gap. The project consists of four related research themes that overall seek to deepen the mathematical understanding of the kernel method so as to exploit its full power in constructing inference procedures that can efficiently handle non-standard data. The project will also shed light on the advantages and limitations of the kernel method over other non-parametric methods in the literature. The aims are to (i) Develop statistical optimality results for kernel-based hypothesis tests and non-linear canonical correlation analysis, (ii) Develop computational vs. statistical trade-off analysis for various kernel learning procedures using approximation schemes such as Nystrom method, random features and their variations, that speed up these procedures, (iii) Develop new methodologies with concrete mathematical guarantees using the kernel method for learning and inference on functions and probability distributions, with applications in functional data analysis, and (iv) Generalize the kernel method using multi-scale kernels to obtain wavelet-like representations and investigate its statistical and computational behaviors in various learning procedures. Overall, the project will develop a comprehensive mathematical theory for computationally efficient kernel-based learning algorithms with applications in statistical learning.

"Metabolism is the biochemical process that supplies energy, molecular building blocks, and chemical signals to control cellular functions essential for life. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Ku-Lung (Ken) Hsu from the University of Virginia to investigate how individual cells control the metabolism of fats and lipids. Dr. Hsu is developing novel chemical compounds that attach to enzymes (protein catalysts) to probe the metabolism of fats and lipids inside of cells. These probes illuminate how cells are similar or distinct based on their metabolic status. Uncovering distinctive metabolic identities within a massive assortment of cells shows how seemingly identical cells differentiate into specific cell types (e.g. a nerve versus a muscle cell). The metabolic signals discovered through these studies may enable the development of new cell types or properties to push the boundaries of cell engineering. Graduate students receive unique training in chemistry and chemical biology to foster their development as outstanding leaders and role models in society. The research project is integrated with an educational outreach program designed to broadly impact Native American students communities by teaching how lipid (bio)chemistry influences healthy food choices and eating behaviors in society.

This research program aims to understand metabolic regulation of cellular function at the single-cell level. The significance of the studies is to establish a fundamental understanding of how identical cells differentiate into functionally distinct cell lineages. The hypothesis is that metabolism imparts asymmetry by providing essential chemical signals that specify a cell's function and fate. Small molecule reporters are integrated with flow cytometry for massively parallel analysis of dynamic metabolic regulation across millions of live cells with unprecedented molecular resolution. Establishing metabolism as a mechanism for asymmetrical specification of cell biology reveals completely new cell phenotypes and has broader impacts in cell biology and engineering. Thus, the research studies are foundational for establishing chemical probes for single-cell analysis that can be combined with modern ""omics"" methods to open new opportunities for probing cellular function with high resolution.

"Non-invasive, wireless-enabled medical devices or biosensors have been emerging as powerful tools to track human performance, biomarkers, and wellness. Within this class of devices, conformal, point-of-care interfaces in the form of flexible devices have become popular due to their low form factor, reduced user burden, and ability to monitor physiological parameters (i.e., heartbeat, acceleration, glucose etc.) on complex surfaces/environments. Existing biosensors within such devices often suffer from large physical size, need for power, short lifetime, and low sensitivity. The objective of this CAREER project is to study, design, and develop wireless-enabled passive radio frequency identification device (RFID) type biosensors. These could be attached, embedded, or potentially implanted to new areas and wirelessly monitor their host environments. These sensors, along with their sensing metal patterns developed on different layers, contain an intermediate layer of nanoporous materials that will absorb, swell or deform in the presence of specific chemical stimuli causing their resonant frequencies to change. This change in the sensor property as function of the change in the stimuli of host environment will be used as a detection mechanism. The proposed new interlayer materials could be membranes, separators, deformable materials, temperature/pH/metal-responsive polymers, and more. Many of these materials have long-lifetimes and possess no degradative mechanism. Significantly improved, conformal, versatile sensors with programmable sensitivity and selectivity are the project goals.  Such devices could potentially integrate with living systems in new ways and enable new applications in wireless health. The unique education and outreach program proposed in this project is focused on powering the creativity and imagination of younger (and often underrepresented) students. Potential technical skills to be learned by undergraduate students include: fabrication experience (metrology, photolithography, 3-D printing), scanning-electron microscopy, experimental methodology, numerical/analytical modelling, data analysis, and computer aided design (CAD). Creating a long-term interest in STEM by teaching fun, biocompatible/safe fabrication procedures that can be performed by students of all ages and skill levels is proposed. Research efforts of this project will be taught in various summer tech camps run by the University of California Irvine (UCI), a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), through programs like BuildCamp and FABcamp. 

This project will develop next-generation, passive wireless biosensors with tunable sensitivity and selectivity. The focus is on utilizing a sensing modality that can support native wireless read-out and robust, long-term operation.  The core sensor is composed of stacked and resonant-coupled split ring coils (or multi-turn antennas) that contain interlayer materials that absorb, swell, or deform in response to physical stimuli.   The development of new fabrication techniques to fuse soft or nanoporous materials with metals into multi-functional constructs will be investigated. This will enable RF analytical biosensors with programmable sensitivity and selectivity. The approach will be to utilize membranes that are able to either selectively absorb analytes from complex biofluids, or heavily swell in response to a specific analyte. Four types of membranes: ion-selective, polymer-aerogel, glucose-responsive, and modified biopolymer will be studied as potential interlayer materials. Theoretical and computational studies on how the unique electromagnetic and bio-interactive physics of respective materials combine to impact sensor performance will be studied and analyzed. The experimental studies on sensor behavior include sensor measurement in mixtures of analyte, the synthesis of sensor-circuits that enable facile and accessible read-out, as well as the studying of arraying as a means of enhancing response.

"Proteins are nanometer-scale molecules whose composition and shape are specified by genes. Inside the cell, they catalyze chemical reactions, perform mechanical work, and assemble into larger structures. The collective action of very many proteins drives cell growth, division, and movement. Proteins are often controlled by external signals – for example, adding a nutrient to the cellular environment might turn a protein “on” or “off” by binding to the protein and altering its shape or dynamics. Such allosteric control provides a basic mechanism for cells to sense and respond to the environment and is a building block for intracellular communication. A complete understanding of how allosteric control works, and how it is encoded in the genetic sequence of proteins, would allow biologists to engineer proteins that respond to artificial cues.  In this project, the PI’s research team will use computation and experiment to understand how allosteric regulation in a protein is optimized, define physical properties distinguishing allosteric surfaces, and construct a set of synthetic allosteric switches that enable control of cell growth rate with light. This work will establish a practical, general toolkit for engineering allosteric regulation, and provide fundamental insights into how natural allosteric regulation might evolve. This proposal will train graduate, undergraduate, and bio-oriented high school students to improve their skills in basic programming and research experimentation to contribute STEM workforce development.

Though allostery is a fundamental and common feature of proteins, how it is encoded by protein sequence and structure remains unclear. For example, it is unknown if the pattern and number of mutations influencing allostery is sparse or abundant, or if the mutations with the biggest effect on regulation are localized to the allosteric site or distributed throughout the structure. This project will address these fundamental questions by using deep mutational scanning to characterize the complete set of mutations than can influence allosteric regulation in a synthetic allosteric switch. This research will also use new approaches in NMR spectroscopy to better understand how protein interactions with water might determine (and identify) allosteric surfaces. The hypothesis is that allosteric surfaces are marked by slowed hydration dynamics. If so, this would suggest that allosteric sites are entropically preferred sites for the evolution of new protein and ligand binding interactions. Moreover, this would open new avenues for the discovery of allosterically acting pharmaceuticals. Finally, the knowledge gained through these mutational and structural studies will be applied to generate a series of broad dynamic range allosteric switches for the light-based control of cell growth. These switches will provide a practical toolkit for dynamically modulating cell growth, with potential applications in the study of bacterial community dynamics, eukaryotic cell proliferation, and engineering live biotherapeutics.

"Since most of the sensitive and standardized bio-analytical techniques work in the liquid medium, the lab-on-a-chip system should be able to efficiently handle liquid solutions in micro/nano scale. To date, most of these systems have been developed based on the continuous flow system which lacks device reconfigurability. Consequently, much attention has been drawn to droplet-based lab-on-a-chip systems, namely, digital micro fluidic systems based on electrowetting that manipulate discrete liquid droplets rather than continuous liquid streams. Nevertheless, the electrowetting-based approach suffers from limitations such as high voltage requirement and biofouling, hampering many real applications. This project provides a straightforward pathway to a new digital micro fluidic platform without electrowetting-related limitations. The proposed platform exploits a purely mechanical means to drive discrete liquid droplets in a rapid, flexible, programmable, and reconfigurable manner. This project will also generate information and demonstration materials that can be directly used to promote both classroom teaching and general public's interest in materials, microfluidics, interfacial science, micro/nanotechnology. 

The project aims to explore the dynamically tunable surface morphology and consequential interfacial wettability using a black silicon ratchet surface in order to seek a new strategy to manipulate liquid droplets for the advancement of digital microfluidics. The proposed ratchet surface involves superhydrophobic black silicon scales on elastomer micropillars such that individual signals actuate individual scales and change the entire surface morphology forming a black silicon ratchet surface that drives liquid droplets. Consequently, droplets are essentially driven mechanically, not electrically. In addition, it is expected that conical nanostructures on the black silicon surface and/or slippery liquid infused porous surfaces to be integrated will significantly reduce biofouling. The proposed approach cannot be realized without elucidating underlying principles and establishing necessary techniques. Two principal investigators’ expertise encompassing mechanics, materials, manufacturing and microfluidics will be combined in order to achieve those understanding and knowledge, and finally open up a new interdisciplinary research area across smart composite materials and digital microfluidics. During the project, three objectives will be systematically pursued to towards the project goal. First, the mechanical characteristics involved in the proposed superhydrophobic ratchet surface will examined, Second, the interaction between liquid droplets and the superhydrophobic ratchet surface will be characterized and associated forces to manipulate liquid droplets on it will be investigated. Finally, droplet manipulations including droplet transporting, merging, and splitting along with the reduced biofouling will be demonstrated.

"Skeletal remains are important sources of information on temporal trends in human health. Porous cranial lesions (PCLs) are interpreted as indicators of nutrient deficiencies and chronic infections and are among the most common pathological findings in human skeletal remains. This doctoral dissertation project uses methods previously applied primarily in archaeological contexts to investigating the causes of PCLs and the health of individuals who live with them. Specifically, the researchers will use an archaeological reference sample to develop computed tomography (CT) criteria for identifying PCLs in living individuals. They will then link measures of individual health to PCL findings from existing CT scans of a living population. Protocols and tools developed for PCL analysis will be made freely available online. The project will strengthen institutional capacity for future research collaborations and support STEM student training at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Because PCLs are developed during childhood, the methods developed in this proposal will have implications for public health across the lifespan. 

PCLs in archaeological samples have been interpreted as evidence of both stress and resilience. This project attempts to resolve this ambiguity by leveraging existing data drawn from a living population to test the association of PCLs in the orbits (cribra orbitalia) and the cranial vault (porotic hyperostosis) with known health profiles. First, the researchers will develop a protocol to extend archaeological methods to determining the prevalence of PCLs in a living population. Specifically, investigators will employ both visual assessments of CT scans and machine learning to reliably identify the presence and extent of PCLs on cranial CT scans using a reference sample of archaeological crania (n = 600). Once developed, investigators will apply the protocol to identify PCLs on existing cranial CTs of 1,310 living adults with known health profiles. This will link childhood development of PCLs to measures of later life health, including biological markers, medical diagnoses, and self-reported wellness. Finally, this project tests the common interpretation of PCLs as indicators of childhood anemia. Using biological markers from dried blood spot samples from children in the same population of living individuals (n = 480), investigators will identify the underlying causes of individual anemia cases and test their association with a biological marker of active bone remodeling.

"The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project will be in developing a crop protective agent that reduces negative environmental impacts and improves overall crop yield. Many common food crops, including tomatoes and peppers, are highly susceptible to fungal contamination; these organisms are rapidly developing resistance to the chemical pesticides widely used today.  The objective of this project is to develop and test a new biofungicide consisting of beneficial fungi to protect plants from variety of diseases and plagues. This solution does not cause harm to the environment and offers a way to manage pesticide-resistant pathogens, which cost approximately $10 billion in the farming market. The proposed project will optimize the biofungicide for the many types of soils, crops and pathogens common across the country. A series of laboratory tests will be conducted to determine the optimal composition of the solution. 

The proposed project involves designing an effective bioprotectant and biostimulant, consisting of two different Trichoderma strains, to provide enhanced protective effects against harmful fungi and bacteria, with the added benefit of boosting plant health and improving overall crop yield. This project will develop new formulations of the blended strain biofungicide to provide maximum flexibility in their application, stability for storage and delivery, as well as testing and optimizing their efficacy in new and unproven combinations of plants, soils and growing conditions. The merits of the bioprotectant anti-fungal have already been demonstrated in preliminary experiments, but only for limited combinations of crops and soils.  Relevant environments will be tested in this project.  Additionally, previous tests have been conducted with dry formulations of Trichoderma, and thus the proposed research will focus on the two key objectives of (i) proving efficacy in new contexts and (ii) developing stable liquid formulations. To this end, a wide matrix of formulations will be tested with a variety of soils, crops and pathogens.

"The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from enabling significant cost and time savings in developing new, more efficient designs in broad fields such as engineering and healthcare. If successful, the project will enable simulations of everything from automobiles to aerospace components and pharmaceuticals to run up to 100 times faster by representing a physical component of a system with an advanced digital analogue.  To date, software incompatibilities have limited the development of this kind of modeling. This project will solve this problem through advanced computational and compiler techniques, and thereby demonstrate the feasibility of a new kind of design process with significant cost reductions.   

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of using neural components in a modular system.  We will combine the successes of surrogate model optimization and neural ODEs to allow for component-based differential-algebraic equation models with automated model order reduction through a latent diffeq. The idea is to build complex models as an assembly of modular pre-designed simulation components using our recent advances in differential programming and learning software to allow for automated training of neural model order reduction for accelerating the solution of large acausal models. Two machine learning methods have promising prospects for accelerating traditional mechanistic modeling workflows: surrogate optimization and neural differential equations.  In this project, we will integrate these components into a prototype system.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide secure and high-performance solar energy to reduce pollution and energy cost, and help establish self-sustainable micogrids.  As the proposed new deep learning-based controller taps into both hardware and software sub-segments for microgrids, the commercial opportunity is considerable. The proposed technology has the potential provide a large-scale microgrid system with affordable off-grid capability and establish a reliable microgrid system with cyberprotection. It offers a cost-effective energy solution to homeowners, schools, business owners, hospitals and clinics, military facilities and other organizations with significant power demands.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a new microgrid controller integrated with a deep neural network algorithm to optimize the system performance with both output and security. The model will help redesign photovoltaic (PV) filters, boost converters and micro-inverters by setting different parameters. Comparing with a simulation-based model, the deep neural network algorithm has a 15% margin on prediction accuracy and speeds up the response time from minute-level to millisecond-level. As a result, 4700 kWh of electricity can be saved annually for a 2000 sq ft house in a state with 80%  sunny days. Due to the millions of parameters used in the algorithm, the new controller is able to support hundreds of users in a single grid. The core of the proposed project includes two deep neural networks (DNNs) using internet of things (IoT)-based sensors for the microgrid data processing. By leveraging the deep learning model and IoT sensors, the proposed system can monitor and detect abnormal usage pattern for the entire system in real time.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to rapidly enable new therapeutically relevant molecules currently impractical to manufacture with conventional techniques. Peptides represent a growing subset of the therapeutics market: there are about 68 currently approved peptide treatments; ~140 peptide treatments in clinical trials and another 500 peptide treatments in the preclinical stage, representing a $21 B market growing to $44 B by 2025. While peptides therapeutics are known for indications such as oncology, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disease, recent interest in personalized peptide therapeutics has grown. Currently, peptides take weeks to synthesize and are tremendously resource-intensive, costing hundreds to thousands of dollars for a few milligrams of product. These high costs and long lead times severely limit the number of molecules a researcher can test in a given period of time, representing the primary bottleneck in peptide therapeutic innovation. Faster access to these potentially therapeutic relevant molecules will accelerate discovery of new therapeutics.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project overcomes the major bottlenecks of peptide manufacturing. The Rapid Automated Computation, Coupling, Cleavage, and Chromatography Execution (RAC4E) Platform produces high purity custom peptides. However, to further extend the ability to control process conditions and achieve real-time process optimization, we propose developing solid-phase slug flow (SPSF) coupling, using advanced engineering and machine learning solutions to generate purity in molecules during synthesis, enabling optimization of the peptide chain in real-time. Combining these solutions will allow the production of peptides both faster and at longer lengths, as well as dramatically reducing the need for downstream purification. Once fully implemented, the RAC4E platform with SPSF coupling will produce peptide libraries
at a speed and purity that will significantly increase the density of biological screening data serving as machine learning inputs. The platform will be later be scaled into a cGMP manufacturing environment, accelerating the rate of entry for novel peptide therapeutics into the clinic.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project addresses biofouling (unwanted attachment of aquatic organisms, e.g. barnacles) of ships . Current antifouling methods are both harmful to the environment and costly. Toxic paints may pollute our seas and waterways. Maintenance to mitigate biofouling is labor-intensive, expensive, and somewhat hazardous. Increases in fuel costs due to frictional drag during a vessel’s operation can approach 40%.  This project will develop an innovative electronic approach to biofouling prevention by developing submersible ultrasonic transducer arrays optimized for low voltage operation in a marina.   The near-term commercial opportunity is with both marina owners and larger marina nationwide operators, with long-term opportunities in commercial and naval military transport, a total addressable market of approximately $10 billion. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the challenges for commercial deployment of transducer arrays to prevent biofouling of ships docked in marinas, and will enhance the scientific understanding of acoustic wave generation in water using piezoelectric transducers and the opportunity to use shock waves to prevent the attachment of bio-species to hulls of ships.  The program has four scientific objectives:   1) Define the maximum fouling-free area and distance possible with a single, ultrasonic transducer mounted 30 to 50 cm underwater, on target surfaces 1 to 15 meters distant.  2) Achieve low-voltage operation required for commercial deployment, using new transducers with low impedance in submersible housings.  3) Develop an ultrasound sensor in a waterproof housing to create a coherent array for full coverage.  4) Develop a prototype electronically steerable array demonstrating a significantly larger biofouling-free area than a fixed transducer element, to enable use on larger ships, such as commercial and military transport.  A beam-steering solution will reduce the required number of transducers for increased functionality.  The program will innovate in areas such as acoustic beam steering, electronic design of piezoelectric transducers, and electro/mechanical design for submersible housings.

"The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I Project is to measure the most critical metrics associated with breastfeeding in real time, namely milk volume and suck patterns. Exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life is highly recommended. While U.S. breastfeeding initiation rates exceed 80%, only 25% of women are able to reach the six-month goal. The leading cause of premature breastfeeding cessation is maternal anxiety about milk supply exacerbated by the absence of an accurate, inexpensive, and convenient means to assess infant milk intake. The current standard-of-care, weighing an infant before and after feeding, requires an expensive clinical scale to detect a 1-2% weight change, trained staff, tight swaddling of the infant, careful operation, and regular calibration. Even then, it’s still a tedious exercise and thus does not provide a quality representative measure of daily milk intake. There is therefore a need for a “thermometer for breastfeeding” – an accurate, easy-to-use device to be used for multiple feedings in both clinical and home settings. The technology developed in this project can be used for rapid identification and intervention for infants at high risk of feeding problems.

This project aims to develop and validate the accuracy of a low-cost wearable patch measuring milk volume and suck patterns in real time. The patch operates by detecting changes in the shape and electrical properties of the breast and can be used for 1-12 feedings per day. Data are reported to a mobile app for tracking and analysis, as well as integration with other key metrics of infant feeding and growth. Several patch configurations will be built and tested to optimize the design and analysis algorithm. The design with highest accuracy will be further validated in a larger study involving breastfeeding mother-infant dyads.

"The objective of the proposal is to investigate a new paradigm for integrating multiple chemical functionalities into a bio-inspired system similar to vascular and nervous systems. The specific functionalities to be investigated are power distribution and information transfer through the electrolyte and information transfer through soft, ionic connections between electrochemical transistors. Results from this research will enable multifunctional synthetic vascular systems that store energy, provide mechanical transmission for actuation, allow communication, and improve computation of nearby electronics. The experimental outcomes and theoretical tools developed during this work will contribute towards overcoming fundamental challenges of autonomy, control, and energy storage in soft robotics. Although these capabilities will be targeted towards soft robotics, they will be broadly useful across all robots and machines. To realize the project goals, the PI will combine fundamental research and educational activities into an integrated program that will train a new generation of scientists and engineers to work at the intersection of electrochemistry, electronics, and robotics through extracurriculars, interdisciplinary courses, undergraduate research, and community development. Students will gain knowledge and skills in areas desired by industry. New initiatives will also increase the involvement of women, underrepresented minority, and first-generation students in national Formula electric racing competitions. 

Modern machines are engineered by integrating specialized components that excel at individual predetermined functions. In contrast, biological systems such as the circulatory, muscular, and nervous systems achieve impressive capabilities through the use of multifunctional chemical processes in an aqueous electrolyte. Despite this diverse functionality, aqueous systems are rarely found as active components in machines due to the difficulty of controlling all the chemical functionality and interfacing with the electrolyte. The intellectual significance of this work will be results from new experiments and theoretical models to understand power and information transmission in electrolyzed fluids. The knowledge gained from studies of ion and dissolved oxygen kinetics under transient conditions with multiple interacting electrodes will enable three new functionalities in the same electrolyte: wire-free distributed power delivery (mimics the animal circulatory system), direct current power and information transmission through the electrolyte (mimics a nervous system), and information transmission through soft, ionic connections between organic electrochemical transistors (for neuromorphic computing). Additionally, undergraduate students will build and measure the heat transfer coefficient of electrolytic fluids, and study their ability to store energy and transport heat.

"This award will provide support to US-based students and post-doctoral fellows and junior scientists to attend the 2020 International Congress on Neuroethology. This five-day conference is recognized as the major, mid-size meeting in Neuroethology, a fertile multidisciplinary field of neuroscience, focused on the neural mechanisms underlying natural behavior. This meeting will bring together outstanding senior and junior scientists for discussions of the recent advances in the field. Invited speakers across many areas of neuroethology, will present their findings on how the activity of animal brains give rise to natural behaviors. The comparative approach that is at the heart of neuroethology, will facilitate the identification of common principles of brain organization as well as detecting mechanisms that enhance behavioral performance, which can then be implemented computationally or technologically. The meeting will feature sessions that  showcase how biological solutions inform new conceptual and technological advances in bio-inspired robotics, smart machines and neural modeling. The results presented at the meeting will have the potential to guide future developments in multiple areas, including neurally inspired design of engineered systems that will have considerable societal benefits.

The intellectual merit of this meeting derives from its small size, which promotes interactions between participants, and the assembly of many top scientists whose research spans neurobiology, engineering and animal behavior.

"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will advance understanding and evaluate the application of several adaptive and energy-efficient soil penetration processes to inspire a new paradigm for design and construction of civil infrastructure. Current and future environmental and economic challenges, including the continued growing population and the depletion of natural resources, create a strong demand for sustainable and adaptive infrastructure. Many aspects of our infrastructure rely on soil penetration processes, from the characterization of soils at project sites to construction. This project will improve our understanding of the soil burrowing and penetration strategies used by several insects, mollusks, and fishes to develop innovative solutions for applications in foundation and anchorage systems, tunneling, soil characterization, and monitoring of sites and structures. The integrated educational, diversity, and outreach goals are to raise awareness and broaden the overall understanding of bioinspiration as a philosophy for development of sustainable engineering solutions and to help develop a workforce that is inclusive of Hispanic and Latinx students for the field of bioinspired geotechnics.

The principal research goals of this project are to identify and quantify the mechanisms that enable efficient soil penetration in biological systems and to effectively upscale these mechanisms to physical scales relevant to civil infrastructure. Biological adaptations involved in wasp, honeybee, mosquito, and sand lance substrate penetration, earth and marine worm locomotion, caecilian and clam burrowing, and root growth will be explored. This project will integrate bioinspired design, laboratory experiments, discrete element modeling simulations, and centrifuge models. The fundamental mechanical processes that facilitate bioinspired soil penetration will be investigated, including soil arching, principal stress rotation, interactions between zones with altered stress states, load transfer and its dependency on shape, and softening caused by pore fluid pressurization. The education and outreach efforts will be targeted towards middle school and high school students through youth citizen science activities and towards undergraduate and graduate students through training in the classroom and the laboratory. This educational and outreach plan will aim to increase participation of Hispanic and Latinx students in the bioinspired geotechnics field.

"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will promote the scientific understanding of active particles at gas-liquid-mineral interfaces and use the insights gained to shift the paradigm in adaptive control of multiphase flow in porous media. Multiphase flow in porous media is mainly governed by the rheological properties of pore fluids and the gas-fluid-mineral interactions. These processes can be substantially altered by adding active suspensions, which are self-propelling objects that can inject energy, generate mechanical stress, or create flows within fluids. Active particles are revolutionizing many industrial and scientific fields, such as ferromagnetic particles for dynamic sealing, micro-robots for targeted delivery of drugs, molecular motors to facilitate cell locomotion, and motile bacteria to tune water into superfluids. Studying active fluids in porous media can renovate commercial techniques in geosystems infrastructure and subsurface energy that will increase the economic and technological competitiveness of the United States. Particularly, translating the technology of using active suspensions into the practical improvement of resource recovery and reliable waste disposal can transform and benefit society. Knowledge gained from this award can also provide insights into microbial infection, bio-microrobots design, and targeted delivery that are relevant to many environmental and health issues pertaining to the well-being of individuals in society. Research and education activities of this CAREER grant will be integrated to foster a cross-disciplinary community in energy geotechnics, inspire the interests of diverse student groups in geotechnics and STEM subjects, and broaden dissemination to the public of the critical role of geotechnical engineering in addressing global challenges related to sustainability and energy. This grant will also facilitate long-term mentoring relationships between the PI and participants, which will strengthen and diversify the underrepresented minority STEM pipeline.

The research objective of this CAREER grant is to understand and model the interactions between motile bacteria and gas-liquid-mineral interfaces. Combined experimental, numerical and analytical modeling will be performed to investigate the effects of three strains of Escherichia coli with different motility (1) at the gas-liquid interface, (2) in pendant and sessile droplets, (3) as bacteria-laden interface migrating through pore space, and (4) during wetting and drying processes in porous media. This research will ultimate (1) quantify the gas-liquid interfacial tension with suspended active particles, (2) understand the role of motility on the hydrodynamic dispersion of bacteria in a pendant droplet, (3) evaluate bacteria motility to pin or depin sessile droplets on hydrophobic and hydrophilic mineral surfaces, (4) measure the capillary signature as active-particle-laden interfaces migrating through pore throats, and (5) model the macroscopic spreading dynamics of motile and nonmotile Escherichia coli during the wetting and drying processes in porous media. Active pore fluids are non-equilibrium systems, present novel features that are interesting scientifically in their own rights. This grant supports the fundamental understanding of the non-linear behavior of active-particle-laden interfaces, which exhibit unique capillarity signatures and buckling mechanisms as they migrate through irregular pore spaces. Research findings of how microbial motility alters multiphase flow patterns provide innovative approaches to subsurface flow management, enhanced resource recovery, adaptive control and targeted delivery of fluids (and associated heat, nutrients, and mass) transfer in porous media. The new knowledge and techniques obtained through this project can be used to develop disruptive technologies of using man-made active particles to alter many fundamental soil phenomena, such as seepage, drainage, consolidation, and liquefaction. Integrated educational objectives of this CAREER grant are to engage a cross-disciplinary community in energy geotechnics and generate greater awareness amongst the public about the geotechnical role in addressing global challenges related to sustainable and energy-viable society. To achieve these objectives, a Vertically Integrated Program on subsurface energy involving K-12 STEM students (through the Research, Experiment, Analyze, Learn REAL program), undergraduate and graduate research assistants, and high school teachers (through the Georgia Intern Fellowship for Teacher GIFT program) will be established to engage a cross-disciplinary community in active fluids through porous media. The research and educational outcomes will be disseminated through increasing scientific literacy, designing classroom challenge problems related to subsurface flow for Atlanta K-12 schools and summer camps, and developing a mobile app that students and public users can select different natural or man-made porous materials to visualize the flow of various fluids and the impacts of added active particles. These products will also be presented at the Tellus Science Museum, Atlanta Science Festival, and Energy Expo.

"This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project develops and implements a new model for transdisciplinary, international education in the area of bio-inspired engineering, potentially adaptable to other fields. IRES scholars under this program study autonomous mobility in complex natural environments based on flying/gliding rainforest animals with the help of an interdisciplinary mentor network located in Korea, Singapore, and Brunei. Each year, 10 graduate students (i.e., 30 over the entire project period) are recruited through broad advertising and a pool of 10+ feeder universities to ensure the IRES program can be integrated into the scholars' thesis research. A 13-week IRES summer program starts with an orientation week at the VT campus followed by a modular sequence of a setup period with an engineering mentor at either Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) or the National University of Singapore (NUS), a biology immersion in Borneo at the University of Brunei (UBD), and finally a data analysis/engineering integration module at KAIST or NUS. The proposed program will aid the development of a U.S. workforce with engineers who have the transdisciplinary and intercultural skills to pull together expertise and natural resources from around the world to solve complex, transdisciplinary problems. Targeted minority recruitment and a detailed dissemination plan will ensure that the project has a wide impact on a diverse talent pool. 

This IRES program implements a novel paradigm to bring international research experiences in STEM in line with the need of solving transdisciplinary challenges through global collaboration and the trend towards personalized learning. To achieve this, the paradigm introduces the following key elements to international research experiences and combines them in a novel manner: (i) focus on research and research-related professional development experiences that are well integrated into the IRES scholars' thesis research , (ii) leveraging a combination of natural and academic resources in a variety of sociocultural settings, (iii) mentor network offering students the opportunity to work with multiple mentors selected according to their needs at the different program stages, (iv) modular customizable approach to paths and schedules for individualized research experiences, (v) pervasive use of a social media many-to-many communication model to ensure coherence within each student cohort and its scientific and social communities, and (vi) constant engagement of students and mentors with the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) to accomplish the professional development goals. The ASEE PI will make sure that all involved faculty (U.S. and international) and students are aware of the professional development opportunities and challenges of the program and receive sound advice how to make best use of the provided opportunities and how to deal with the challenges. Through this project, achieving the scientific goal of autonomy in complex natural environments will have a transformative impact on societal challenges related to environmental monitoring and clean-up, precision agriculture and forestry, and novel forms of autonomous transportation.

"This project supports  partial travel for 40 U.S. students and early career engineers/faculty to the 5th Thermal and Fluids Engineering Conference (TFEC) organized by the American Society of Thermal and Fluids Engineers (ASTFE). In addition, the funding will facilitate participation of 10 invited speakers and panelists who would otherwise be unlikely to attend the conference. The Thermal and Fluids Engineering Conference (TFEC) is an annual conference since 2015 that has grown to become a leading platform for presentation and discussion of research advances in thermal and fluids engineering. In 2020, the conference will take place April 5-8, 2020 in New Orleans, LA. The annual TFEC conference addresses the need for a platform for dissemination and discussion of research results in the fields of heat transfer and fluid mechanics. A number of sessions encompassing the breadth of thermal and fluid transport are currently being organized for the conference. The proposed NSF support will enable a significant intellectual benefit and professional development opportunity for a number of students and early career engineers/faculty from around the country. The participation of invited speakers and panelists enabled by the support will enhance and broaden the technical content of the conference, thereby benefiting all attendees. It is expected that this travel grant will focus research collaborations in multiple areas related to heat transfer and fluids engineering. The in-person platform offered by the conference is expected to lead to interesting and fruitful technical conversations. It is expected that this will lead to novel, collaborative approaches for addressing fundamental and applied problems in thermal and fluids engineering. 

Thermal and fluids engineering effects a very broad spectrum of the industry and life in general. Advances in this field enabled by the conference may help improve and optimize a large number of applications that benefit the entire society in general. Some examples of applications to be discussed at TFEC include wind turbines, fuel cells, industrial processes, biomedicine, etc. Full papers and extended abstracts for TFEC are published by Begell House in the form of a conference proceeding. This set of papers are compiled and made available on the Begell House website. This will result in broad dissemination of research results presented at the conference. Given that the conference is being held in New Orleans, keynote presentations and other activities will be organized to introduce the audience to local issues of relevance to thermal/fluids engineering, such as water management of river, flood, and hurricane-induced wave interactions between ocean, bayous, canals, lakes, and waterways. Furthermore, the thermal-fluid science and engineering community will be introduced to the success stories of various local entrepreneurial efforts in bio-science/engineering in New Orleans area. By striving to ensure significant representation of minorities and women among the travel grant beneficiaries, the conference organizers will ensure that minorities and women specifically benefit from the conference. Specific efforts will be made to publicize the travel grant opportunity among women and persons from traditionally under-represented groups and increase their participation in the conference.

"Understanding the brain in the context of its interactions with the world is key to assessing its dynamics in health and disease states. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology is able to track blood-oxygen-level dependent signals over time and serve as a proxy to neural activity. Current approaches have limitations, as they assume that the interdependence between distinct brain regions is constant throughout recording periods. These approaches also assume that the brain is an isolated system that does not consider outside stimulus. To capture the highly complex dynamics and to enable the understanding of the neural basis of human cognition this research project will develop new data analysis methods for processing brain activity to explain the relationships involved in attention, learning, memory, decision-making, and language. This multidisciplinary effort will also enable the training of a new generation of engineers and clinicians, with particular emphasis on underrepresented groups, who can use the new data analytics to aid them during decision-making to assess the brain’s health enabling earlier diagnostics. The results of this research will have a great impact on healthcare and benefit the U.S. economy and society.
 
To capture the highly complex spatiotemporal brain activity, this grant supports development of a model-based approach that captures the non-stationarity and fractal behavior of the brain dynamics. As a consequence, it will unveil dynamical characteristics that can be used to quantitatively and qualitatively measure how well an individual is doing in a particular task (e.g., attention/memory). Furthermore, the model-based approach in this project lays down the framework to perform control where quantitative measures can be used to establish control objectives regarding success in performing a given task. Unlike currently employed short-range memory models, this project focuses on a generalized mathematical framework that captures the degree of a memory of brain activity. Thus, the research will provide new insights and information about the brain organization and cognition that may fundamentally change the way one examines neuro-related data.

"With this award, the Chemical Measurements and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. James Harper of the University of Central Florida to extend the capability of theoretical methods to accurately predict crystal structures.  Presently, many compounds and even entire classes of compounds are unsuitable for analysis by conventional crystallography methods.  This project combines lattice prediction methods with experimental NMR data to provide new methodology capable of solving structural problems that are now intractable.  This outcome will impact society by improving the ability to characterize a host of new materials.  For example, nearly 60 cephalosporin antibiotics have been described since 1955, yet over 93% in the structures have never been characterized crystallographically. The project focuses on characterizing key cephalosporins as well as other challenging materials.

This project focuses on improving the theoretical prediction of crystal structure by including experimental solid-state NMR data in the prediction process.  The NMR data serve to identify a single high-probability conformation before the prediction process.  Because many lattice prediction programs robustly and accurately treat rigid structures but are challenged by flexibility, the NMR data improves prediction by limiting the conformational space searched.  The experimental NMR measurements focus primarily on 13C and 15N chemical shift tensors because such data provide three measurable parameters for each molecular position.  Uncertainties in atomic positions are provided through a molecular dynamics process, to ultimately create structures suitable for deposit into crystallographic databases.  The broader impact of this work includes training students from a primarily undergraduate institution (Washington and Jefferson College) in an annual three week NMR course involving 6-8 students, the creation of a series of Open Courseware lectures describing basic NMR concepts and the more specialized tensor measurement methods, and outreach into the scouting community of central Florida through lab tours and voluntary teaching of merit badge courses.","Provo","Brigham Young University","47.049","255406","Chemical Measurement & Imaging","2016185","jkharper@chem.byu.edu","James","Harper","01/10/2020","09/01/2019","07/31/2021","CAREER: Developing Accurate Crystallography Without Diffraction","BIO"

Collaborative Research: A self-contained microfluidic optical cavity biosensing platform for multiplex label-free molecular diagnostics
 
2-	Brief description of project Goals: 
We aim to demonstrate a self-contained microfluidic optical cavity sensor which enables simple, cost-effective, label-free and highly sensitive biomarker screenings.

3-	Abstract:

3a. Nontechnical:
Millions of people suffer from major chronic diseases such as cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, and infectious disease. To improve survival rates of patients and give the right treatment at the right time, early diagnosis of these diseases is required. The most common way to diagnose these diseases is to use a biochemical test that measures the presence or concentration of a macromolecule in a solution through the use of an antibody. The current gold standard biochemical test for detecting these biomarkers is called an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Such tests have significant limitations with respect to the required sample volume, total testing time, expensive fluorescence detection and an inability to test for many biomarkers simultaneously. A simpler and more cost effective approach is still needed to achieve a more efficient biochemical testing platform. In this research project, we will demonstrate a novel optical cavity biosensor, a sensor that detects the concentration of biomarkers with simple two partially reflecting mirror structure, integrated with a simple microfluidic device. This integrated device enables automated, low-cost, and highly sensitive sensing which is required for various molecular diagnostic fields. Such rapid, simple and cost effective label-free biosensors have the potential to transform the field of early disease screening and to make significant impact on various clinical and healthcare applications. In addition, a new bio-sample handling technique will be implemented to make overall testing procedures simple.
The education and outreach activity of this project is well-aligned with the research approach and outcomes. By educating undergraduate and graduate students through summer research experiences, new courses, and seminars, we will be able to deliver the state-of-art techniques related with micro/nanotechnologies. More specifically, by adapting the use of microfluidic system and optic sensors into new courses, we will enhance hands-on learning of microfabrication and semiconductor/microfluidic processes. For K-12 students, we will use this advanced biosensing tool for STEM education. Real demonstration of this work will be broadened through the development and distribution of educational activities on the optical physics and micro-flow phenomena. 

3b. Technical:
A standard ELISA process includes a laborious and time-consuming sample preparation and labeling processes that involve complicated multi-step chemical reactions, expensive fluorescence and laser equipment to detect a labeled molecule. A simpler and cost effective approach is still needed to achieve a more efficient immunoassay platform. By developing optical cavity biosensor arrays, we will achieve the ultimate goal in biosensors which is a combination of label-free, low cost, high sensitivity, and high selectivity. In addition, adapting a differential detection method with multiple diode systems enables a multiplexing immunoassay, enhances the sensor`s sensitivity and increases the linear dynamic range. By integrating the optical cavity sensor with the self-contained microfluidic platform, we will design SMDx (self-contained multiplexable label-free diagnostics) to achieve a label-free, multiplexable microfluidic molecular diagnostic system. In this platform, various bioassay protocols can be implemented using pumpless technology. Furthermore, the SMDx platform can be readily extended to a portable system by incorporating a modular biosensing system for reliable medical diagnostics.

This project has multiple aims:
 (1) Develop an affordable point-of-care biosensor using optical cavity structure enabling multiplexing bioassay with high sensitivity.
(2) Understand sensitivity enhancement by increasing the responsivity of the transducer through the differential detection method. 
(3) Demonstrate a seamless microfluidic device containing passive flow control with channel surface properties and wicking force.
(4) Implement a self-contained multiplex label-free diagnostics (SMDx) platform for cardiac panel screenings.","Salt Lake City","University of Utah","47.041","6088","CCSS-Comms Circuits & Sens Sys","1946730","jkim@mech.utah.edu","Jungkyu","Kim","09/19/2019","07/09/2019","02/29/2020","Collaborative Research: A self-contained microfluidic optical cavity biosensing platform for multiplex label-free molecular diagnostics","BIO"

They are at risk because their infrastructure often is in disrepair, no longer appropriate for more intense or frequent extreme events, or unable to keep up with rapid urban population growth. Traditional engineered infrastructure, such as stormwater drainage systems or sea walls, is usually designed for only one purpose and seldom can adapt to changing conditions. Solutions that are based on nature-preserving protective ecosystems, incorporating ecological elements or even mimicking nature in built infrastructure, offer flexibility in the face of changing conditions and provide multiple benefits to society, often at relatively low cost. The NATure-based solutions to Urban Resilience in the Anthropocene (NATURA) project links 26 networks to enhance connectivity among the world's scholars and practitioners and improve the prospects for global urban sustainability.  NATURA exchanges knowledge, shares data, and enhances communication among research disciplines and across the research-practice divide to advance understanding of how to prepare for the growing threat of extreme weather events. As an important part of this knowledge sharing, learning exchanges will build capacity of the next generation of researchers and practitioners to work together on applications of nature-based solutions in a wide range of social, ecological, and technological contexts.

The NATURA international network of networks brings together research scientists (ecologists, engineers, and social scientists) and city practitioners (such as officials from city, county, or state governments, members of non-governmental organizations, and community leaders) who work on devising and implementing solutions to the challenge of extreme events. NATURA will unite 21 networks focused in Europe, South Africa, China, North and South America, and globally with 5 U.S.-based networks that are conducting research and implementing nature-based solutions. NATURA will advance theory and research on nature-based solutions, identifying and filling research gaps across diverse global social-biophysical contexts to understand where nature-based solutions are unique or can be more generally applied to meet urban resilience challenges. Through all-hands meetings, thematic working groups, regional nodes, and synthesis writing workshops, the project will accomplish the goals of synthesis and data sharing, and network coordination. Early-career researchers and practitioners will be sponsored by NATURA to pay five-week visits to network partners. Further, NATURA will train postdoctoral scholars and graduate students through learning exchanges to networks around the globe. Through collaboration with partners, international students will be invited to participate in these exchanges, hosted by US networks.  

The Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program is designed to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations.  The AccelNet program supports strategic linkages among U.S. research networks and complementary networks abroad that will leverage research and educational resources to tackle grand scientific challenges that require significant coordinated international efforts.

"4D bioprinting is an emerging manufacturing process to create smart tissue constructs where cellular behaviors can be regulated in both space and time. The objective of this study is to 4D bioprint dynamic light-responsive smart constructs to control the functions of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells.  For this purpose, novel light-sensitive ink materials will be synthesized and characterized, and a series of smart structures will be printed to study the effect of the bioprinting process on the structure's dynamic shape changes. Finally, the effects of light-triggered 4D structures on regulating cardiomyocyte growth, differentiation, and beating will be explored. The manipulation of cardiac cell behaviors through 4D bioprinting processes will expand our understanding of cardiac cell function for potential cardiac engineering applications. In addition, this collaborative research will lay the foundation for next-generational 4D bioprinting platforms. Educational and outreach activities will involve a collaboration between the George Washington University and University of Maryland, College Park for sharing research experiences, improvement of existing courses, and inclusion of undergraduate and K-12 students, with broad representations of underrepresented minorities in research, to help educate the future bioengineering workforce.

The objective of this study is to 4D bioprint reprogrammable near-infrared light (NIR) responsive smart constructs and to discover 4D dynamic effects on controlling human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocyte (iPSC-CM) function and beating behaviors, hypothesizing that these structures will be successfully created and the 4D dynamic effect will greatly improve iPSC-CM functionality and beating behaviors. The first key innovation focuses on creating a new generation of light-sensitive smart inks with precisely controlled multi-responsive 4D effects and bio-functionality.  A human benign NIR sensitive moiety will be used in the synthesized 4D ink as a model smart switch. The long-wavelength NIR can efficiently penetrate through the printed biomaterials compared to ultraviolet/visible light and will not harm the surrounding cells.  The iPSC-CM is selected because it is a mechanically responsive cell line that is perfect for studying 4D dynamic effects for basic and translational cardiovascular research.  This cell line also offers the key advantages of being in virtually unlimited cardiomyocyte supply, as well as having a high regenerative capacity. The project's objectives will be accomplished under three aims.  The FIRST Aim is to formulate and characterize a novel smart ink with three key components: a natural triglyceride-based monomer that will serve as the printable matrix of the ink, a liquid crystal polymer that is a critical functional component to exert the reprogrammable property and a NIR moiety with a light polymerizable double bond group. The reaction and the molecular structures will be characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The 4D inks will be formulated by varying the ratios of the above components in order to achieve a desired, printable rheological property.  The SECOND Aim is to bioprint smart structures and explore the effect of the bioprinting process on 4D dynamic shape changes. A custom designed stereolithography (SL) bioprinter, which is capable of controlling key bioprinting parameters (printing speed, printing layer height and laser intensity), will be used to print the synthesized ink materials. The relationship between the printing parameters and the 4D shape change of the light-sensitive smart structure will be established. The THIRD aim is to investigate the dynamic shape change of NIR responsive structures on regulating iPSC-CM functions. The interaction of iPSC-CMs with the NIR responsive structures will be thoroughly studied; the growth of iPSC-CMs on the bioprinted constructs will be determined; the effect of the 4D variations of the bioprinted constructs on calcium transience, myogenesis, and gene expression of iPSC-CMs will be qualitatively and quantitatively examined by Fluo-4 AM, immunocytochemistry, and gene analysis. This study will for the first time explore the fundamental interactions between NIR regulated 4D structures and cardiomyocyte behaviors.

This research forms the pathway to the discovery of new medicines as well as new therapies. As such, biomedical research is crucial to advance the national health and prosperity. Given the geographically distributed research groups and biomedical labs, collaborative science plays a very important role in biomedical research. Galaxy is an open source, web-based framework that is extensively used by more than 20,000 researchers world-wide for conducting research in many application domains, the most prominent of which is biomedical research.  It provides a web-based environment using which scientists perform various computational analyses on their data, exchange results from these analyses, explore new research concepts, facilitate student training, and preserve their results for future use. Galaxy currently runs on a large variety of high-performance computing (HPC) platforms including local clusters, supercomputers in national labs, public datacenters and Cloud. Unfortunately, while most of these systems supplement conventional CPUs with significant accelerator capabilities (in the form of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and/or Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)), the current Galaxy implementation does not take advantage of these powerful accelerators. This project enhances the Galaxy framework so that it can take full advantage of the tremendous computational capabilities offered by GPUs and FPGAs. By doing so, the important applications running under Galaxy experiences significant speedups, thereby accelerating scientific discoveries.  

This project consists of four complementary tasks, which follow a logistic progression as follows: Task-I focuses on redesigning existing Galaxy tools with GPU/FPGA support and integrate them to Galaxy tool-chains; Task-II provides containerization support for the tools and accelerator-aware orchestration for running Galaxy on cloud platforms; Task-III implements specific policy driven scheduling schemes for Task-I and Task-II; and finally, Task-IV redesigns Galaxy storage to speed up execution and reduce bottlenecks related to data transfer. The proposed enhancements to Galaxy enables the integration of innovation with discovery by providing a state-of-the art experimental platform to a larger community of researchers across several disciplines. On the broader impact and outreach/educational front, this project impacts the performance and energy efficiency of Galaxy tools and applications and improves the productivity of a typical Galaxy user tremendously; that is, the main beneficiaries of this project are thousands of members of existing Galaxy Community. However, this project also (i) helps existing GPU and FPGA based (non-Galaxy) applications start using Galaxy, thereby taking full advantage of all existing toolsets within the framework, (ii) enables Galaxy tools to take better advantage of emerging cluster scheduling capabilities, and (iii) creates a synergy with concurrent Galaxy related efforts and existing infrastructure efforts the PIs are involved with, to further expedite scientific discoveries. As such, this proposed system support will have a broad societal impact via the enhanced Galaxy system support.  On the education side, the project involves under-represented groups in computer science as well as in bio-informatics, outreach to undergraduates, various K-12 related activities (Science-U, CSATS, VIEW), and engagement with researchers in other disciplines (e.g., natural language processing, image processing, drug discovery and cosmology) via a workshop open to the Galaxy community.

"Complex fluids are a broad class of materials widely used in processes spanning the chemical, petroleum, pharmaceutical and food industries. They are also abundant in natural environments (for example, soil and mud) as well as in the human body (for example, mucus and reproductive fluids). Complex fluids may be considered 'soft', in the sense that they flow or distort easily in response to external forces. Many fascinating macroscopic responses of complex fluids containing particles, polymers, (bio)molecules, surfactants, or liquid crystals, have been widely reported in the literature. Characterizing the mechanical properties and microstructure of complex fluids and biological materials remains a challenge. The main issue is that one needs to precisely measure the material bulk response (or rheology) while simultaneously characterizing its microstructure. To that end, this project involves developing an instrument that incorporates a sensitive rheometer with a dynamic range that allows precise application of kinematic deformation coupled with a confocal microscope that provides real space, high-magnification, time-resolved spatial information in three dimensions. 

This research project aims to develop a confocal rheometer microscope by combining two commercially-available instruments, a confocal microscope and a stress-controlled rheometer. This new apparatus will allow researchers to impose precise kinematic deformation (i.e. shear, steady or time-dependent) onto a desired material while simultaneously characterizing the fluid microstructure and measuring the bulk fluid response. By incorporating both a high precision rheometer and a confocal microscope into one system, the project researchers will be able to conduct cutting edge experiments that relate 3-dimensional microstructure to bulk properties.  The research project also could lead to new fundamental understanding of the mechanical and chemical forces that govern the dynamics of complex and soft materials and to new applications via the development of novel materials.

"Cyanide is a poison that is common among plants and toxic to most animals. Nonetheless, three species of bamboo lemur focus most of their feeding time on various parts of Malagasy giant bamboo, which exposes the lemurs to 12-50 times their estimated lethal dose of cyanide on a daily basis. This project will examine the underlying physiology and genomics of cyanide detoxification in bamboo lemurs. In addition to addressing the decades-old puzzle of how these lemurs are able to consume high levels of cyanide, this study may inform the development of therapies, antidotes, or prophylactics to cyanide exposure in humans. During the course of this work, the PI and co-PI will invite and recruit undergraduates from Kent State University's McNair Scholars Program, whose mission is to help first-generation, low-income undergraduates matriculate to a doctoral degree program. The co-PI will also utilize close ties with Northeast Ohio's public libraries and schools to present this project to students and the general public.

The central questions of this study focus on known routes of cyanide detoxification among mammals. Low doses of the poison can be metabolized by a variety of conserved mechanisms, foremost among which is a pathway that uses sulfurtransferase enzymes. The limiting factors for this mechanism appear to be relative expression levels for these enzymes and the availability of sulfur-donor molecules (e.g., thiosulfate). Therefore, the first working hypothesis of this study is that H. aureus has adapted to detoxify its highly cyanogenic diet through positive selection on genes involved in the metabolism of sulfur or sulfur-containing amino acids. This hypothesis will be tested by assembling and mining a reference-quality genome for H. aureus and comparing it to data taken from a proposed genome assembly for Lemur catta, the most closely related species of dietary generalist. It is further hypothesized that H. aureus detoxifies its high levels of circulating cyanide through adaptive changes to the composition of the bloodstream. This second hypothesis will be tested by transcriptomic and metabolomic methods in order to compare the expression profiles and thiosulfate levels, respectively, of free-ranging H. aureus and captive L. catta. Together, these methods will examine adaptive changes in the H. aureus genome, as well as the whole-blood transcriptome and metabolome, which are related to the exceptional cyanide tolerance of this species.

"General Audience Summary 

A post-doctoral research fellow will examine the social, ethical, and policy implications of neuropsychological research on implicit bias. He will use a multi-sited qualitative methodology to empirically trace and elucidate the material consequences and social implications of implicit bias research. This project seeks to understand how neuroscience research on implicit bias is produced and organized in the lab, and to understand how social dynamics are conceptualized and operationalized in neuropsychological research on implicit bias, with specific emphasis on the promises and challenges of operationalizing race and racism at the neurobiological level. These determinations will then be used by the research fellow to elucidate the current and future interventions and policy opportunities for neuropsychological research on implicit bias. The results from this project will help better appraise ethical issues raised by the use of neuroscience research in society, which will aid in development and implementation of institutional and social policies on inequality and discrimination. The project serves enhance the number of underrepresented minority researchers focused on ethical, legal, and social impacts of science and technology.

Technical Summary 

This project is one of the first empirical science projects to examine how race is used and invoked in neuroscience research. It will contribute substantially to the well established Science, Technology, and Society (STS) research on genomics and race by providing insight into the ways these new neuro-understandings of cognition and behavior impact experiences with and practices of race. The study will address the growing use of bio-social models of research by focusing on the way social dynamics are measured and utilized in implicit bias research. The study will take the materiality and social realities of the brain seriously; in so doing, it will describe how the ""social"" is defined, operationalized, and transformed (or re-imagined) through neuro-research. In addition, the project will help illuminate the ethical challenges for neuroscience research and elucidate the advantages and limits of interdisciplinary STS scholarship that is focused on the intersections between the brain and sociality.","Louisville","University of Louisville Research Foundation Inc","47.075","44406","STS-Sci, Tech & Society","1932878","orollins@uw.edu","Oliver","Rollins","09/16/2019","10/01/2018","09/30/2021","A Study of the Social, Ethical, and Policy Implications of Neuropsychological Research on Implicit Bias","BIO"
"In many primate species, males have much larger canines than do females, a character known as canine sexual dimorphism. In humans, the canines of males and females are very similar in size (monomorphic). This doctoral research project investigates the evolution and function of large male canine teeth in a model primate species to better understand potential selection pressures for dimorphism, and to use as comparative data to understand why the loss of this feature evolved in humans. This project provides training opportunities in both fieldwork and data analysis for undergraduate and graduate students in New York and Puerto Rico. 

This study will integrate morphological, genetic, and behavioral data to test the hypothesis that large male canines are a sexually selected signal and/or weapon in primates. This project also explores mechanisms of canine size evolution (heritability and selection). The Co-PI will collect data on canine size to investigate how canine size is inherited and whether canine size predicts reproductive success. She will also conduct field experiments to determine if males and females attend to differences in male canine size. Finally, she will integrate canine size data with behavioral data to assess whether canine size predicts the occurrence and outcome of fights between males. The results of this project will contribute knowledge about the mechanisms behind both the evolution of canine dimorphism and the loss of this character in humans.

"Interconnected food-energy-water (FEW) demands are increasing due to increasing population and economic growth. One of the major reasons for these increased demands is the generation of non-utilized waste streams. The U.S. generates approximately 254 million tons of trash each year, with only 34% of this waste recycled or composted.  Increasing restrictions on the export of garbage has generated both challenges and opportunities for the management of waste systems. Waste material provides and opportunity for materials recovery, the generation of new products and processes, and the potential to positively impact food, energy, and water systems.  Given the increasing rates of consumption internationally, developing the next generation of waste recovery is of global significance.  However, reinventing waste streams requires a better understanding of how waste is currently governed, rethinking and redesigning waste recovery production systems to better capture the value of material, developing systems for monitoring material composition, integration with new cyber infrastructure for waste monitoring, and incorporating the behavioral and policy structures that influence action across complex multi-scaled systems.  The objectives of the project are to develop a systems-level framework for comparative analysis of organic waste lifecycles that combines behavior sciences with material flows analysis to rethink waste systems and the development of new co-products from organic wastes. 

This proposal focuses on systems-level interactions in the framework of ""Organic Waste Lifecycles at the Interface of Food, Energy and Water Systems (OWL-FEWs)."" The project entails the development of the next generation of cyber-infrastructure for measuring, monitoring, and capturing data on organic waste streams; analysis of social and institutional drivers behind organic waste disposal behavior; and experimentation, development, and testing of new co-products from organic waste streams. Utilizing an existing pilot-scale anaerobic digester, bio/hydrochar engineering facilities, open source radio frequency identification tagging for real time tracking of waste flows, and a series of behavior experiments and comparative institutional analysis of human behavior, the research team will focus on five goals: 1) The development of a dynamic model of organic waste lifecycles at a regional level; 2) The development and testing of organic food waste co-products for energy, soil amendments, water remediation, and other uses; 3) The development of a smart organic food waste cyber infrastructure; 4) The integration of social sciences across the development of the dynamic model, cyberinfrastructure, and waste/resource products; and 5) The engagement of stakeholders across the research and educational efforts. The results of this research will provide meaningful pathways to reducing waste in the U.S. and provide water treatment, energy, and agricultural resources from waste, leading to better food, energy, and water security in the U.S.

"PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY

Unlike electronic devices that control information by affecting the flow of electrons, photonic devices control information by affecting the flow of photons or light and have the potential to overcome the speed and bandwidth of electronic devices. Key to photonic devices is their basic components -- photonic crystals, which are periodic nanostructures consisting of regularly repeating regions of high and low dielectric constants.  Transmission of light through such a crystal is prevented due to multiple reflections at the interfaces between alternating dielectric domains; this occurs when the wavelength is comparable to characteristic domain sizes. The band gaps of most existing photonic crystals, however, cannot be actively controlled because once a nanostructure is formed, its domain size cannot be changed. It remains a challenge in the development of adaptive photonic crystals to control light on-demand. This project aims to establish the foundational knowledge required to design and create Adaptive Photonic Polymers -- polymeric photonic crystals that enable active control of visible and infrared light. Educationally, in addition to providing research opportunities for graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students from diverse backgrounds, the topics considered in this program will be integrated into a newly developed course, ""Advanced Polymers."" The project also incorporates a number of outreach activities.


PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY

This research program aims to establish the molecule-microstructure-property-function relation for Adaptive Photonic Polymers -- polymeric photonic crystals that enable on-demand control of light. The central hypothesis is that exploiting the self-assembly of architecturally designed block copolymers enables responsive periodic dielectric nanostructures with exceptionally large characteristic lengths necessary for manipulating light of a wide range of wavelengths. The PI's work will focus on: (i) development of methods for controlled synthesis of block copolymers with extreme molecular architecture such as large diameter and high molecular weight; (ii) determining the molecular architecture for which the polymers form long-range, ordered nanostructures of large characteristic lengths necessary for visible and infrared light; (iii) establishing the causal relation between microstructure and macroscopic optical properties; (iv) quantifying the response of optical properties to external stimuli using custom-developed in-situ characterization techniques. The experimental studies will be corroborated by scaling theory and self-consistent field theoretical simulations. Using the fundamental understanding gained and the technologies developed through these studies, active fast control of visible and infrared light will be demonstrated using one Adaptive Photonic Polymer. This research will be integrated into a variety of educational experiences in the laboratory and the classroom at the graduate, undergraduate, and 6-12 levels.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be the development of a novel process to generate environmentally friendly, low-cost and robust structural color paints to address the increasing concerns over emission of toxic elements into the environment by the spray-painting of pigment-based paints, e.g. those used in automobile industry. It also provides a cost-effective solution for making structural colors without using expensive vacuum equipment. We propose a new process to immerse 3D shaped parts directly into specially prepared non-toxic chemical solutions to electrochemically deposit multilayered structural colors. The advantage of this proposed process is twofold: (1) it can potentially reduce the overall coating time by 20-30% (2) it can reduce carbon emissions and waste generation from the spray-painting process by 50%. In addition, structural colors can be designed to produce optical resonances in any wavelength, a property that makes it highly compatible with LiDAR systems. The coming mobility and autonomous driving era have opened a vast market for specially prepared reflective coatings that are specifically compatible with LiDAR systems, which presents an exciting opportunity for the optically designed structural colors. Lastly, because the design is flexible with the type of materials used to generate bright and vibrant colors, one can select materials that are bio-compatible and safe to wear on skin, which can open future applications for our technology in the cosmetics industry. 

This I-Corps project involves the use of electrodeposition to generate metal-dielectric-metal multilayered structural color paints and has several clear advantages over traditional deposition or assembly methods for preparing colored films. Unlike pigment-based colors, structural colors generate color using the interference effect of light. Different colors of high brightness are achieved by simply tuning the thickness of the electrodeposited middle cavity layer. Structural colors are an environmentally friendly alternative to pigments and generate brighter and more efficient colors compared to pigments. However, their extensive uses at low cost are still hindered due to the complicated fabrication processes and the required expensive vacuum systems for material deposition. To address this issue, our innovation introduces an inexpensive and non-toxic bench-top electrodeposition method for the fabrication of thin film structural colors of optical quality that is entirely performed at ambient conditions without caustic reagents and without the use of any expensive ancillary equipment. Our process is compatible with highly non-planar substrates of arbitrary shape, size and roughness, which could be ideal for the coating of automobile body and many shaped interior parts.

"The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR phase II project will develop magnetic and fluorescent reagents for the separation and analysis of cells from tissue samples stored in biobanks, central repositories for biological samples, including tissues, cells, blood, sera, and urine, and their associated patient data, used in research to identify new methods to diagnose and treat disease; this industry is currently $52 B/yr with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5%.  Biobank samples typically consist of a mixture of pathologically normal and diseased cells and tissues, requiring separation.  Sample quality is thus critical for biobanks. The cell separation market ($3.9 B/yr, CAGR 4.1%) is dominated by the flow cytometry segment ($3.1 B/yr, CAGR 3.6%); whereas magnetic cell separation is a growing market ($582 M/yr by 2020 CAGR of 6.4%). Most biobanks currently provide unpurified samples or samples purified via flow cytometry alone, with typical recoveries of <10% at purities of ~20%. This research will develop and commercialize reagents that combine magnetic separation with flow cytometry analysis for target cell purification from biobank tissue samples. In the company's Phase I research of cells in suspension, these reagents yielded ~100% recovery with purities >75%. This research will expand this technology to tissue homogenates with increased heterogeneity and viscosity, increasing purity of biobank samples and enhancing researcher ability to develop breakthrough medical technologies.

This research will develop magnetic-fluorescent nanoparticle reagents for cell separation and subsequent flow cytometry analysis of heterogeneous clinical tissue samples from biobanks.   Given the heterogeneous nature of biological specimens that may contain more normal than diseased components, purification technologies are critical to biobank operation.  Based on the Phase I research, the company anticipates that this technology could increase recovery and purity to > 75% (vs. 10-20% currently). This will be accomplished by: (1) developing an open magnetic separation system to reduce obstruction compared to existing commercial magnetic bead-packed columns; (2) optimization of reagent magnetic and fluorescent content to maximize cell separation and analysis signal while minimizing size and signal overlap with tissue autofluorescence; (3) protocol development for tissue homogenate analysis using commonly employed mechanical and enzymatic tissue digestion methods. This research will yield new tools for cell isolation from complex, viscous environments that will greatly enhance the utility of biobank samples in research and clinical investigations. Such improvements will also benefit applications with less rigorous engineering design requirements, including bio/pharma separations, bioprocessing (e.g., CAR T-cell therapy), and clinical diagnostics (e.g., circulating tumor cell recovery).

"The hydrogen bond (H-bond) is an essential element of many materials including DNA, proteins, hydrogels and molecular self-assemblies. Despite existing knowledge of energy transport in some large protein systems, a systematic understanding of nanoscale thermal transport across H-bonded materials and, in particular, the role of H-bonds is lacking. The knowledge gap has hindered the understanding of heat transfer in living systems and development of novel biomaterials, e.g. synthetic spider silk, with extraordinary thermal properties. To address these critical challenges, this project investigates a suite of H-bonded materials including protein secondary structures and organic-inorganic interfaces, using state-of-the-art computational approaches combined with experimental validations. The research outcomes will accelerate design, development and deployment of novel H-bonded materials with tunable thermal properties, to meet the increasing needs for biocompatible, multifunctional materials in a wide range of areas including bio-implantation, tissue regeneration, cancer treatment, and energy storage. This project also seeks to achieve three societally relevant outcomes including (1) broadening participation of Female Native American students in engineering through two mentoring programs; (2) fostering skills of materials modeling among undergraduate students using a 3D Printing Challenge and a Fellowship program; and (3) conveying essential concepts of biomaterials and thermal management to high school students and the general public through outreach activities.

Building upon recent progress in advanced phonon transport theory and vibrational mode analysis, this project systematically reveals the role of H-bonds in thermal transport across several representative building blocks of H-bonded materials including nanocrystals (e.g. protein beta-sheets), nanowires (e.g. protein alpha-helices and 3-10 helices) and interfaces. By using molecular dynamics simulations and functional theory calculations, the investigations quantifies anisotropy of thermal conduction in the H-bonded building blocks in association with several structural and environmental factors including the H-bond connectivity (e.g. alpha helices vs. 3-10 helices), the side chain chemistry and size, and the solvation. Particular emphasis is given to understanding how different amino acid sequences can affect thermal conductivities and transport characteristics including phonon density of states, group velocities, and lifetimes. New physical insights are generated regarding: (1) how H-bond networks of different forms contribute to nanoscale thermal transport; and (2) how thermal transport in H-bonded materials differs from that in other 1D (e.g. nanotubes), 2D (e.g. graphene) and 3D materials that have no H-bonds. The achieved knowledge base enables development of new synthetic silk with highly conductive building blocks as well as novel H-bonded interfaces that are made, characterized and compared with existing materials for validation of the theory.

"The prevalence of Wi-Fi devices and ubiquitous coverage of Wi-Fi networks provide the opportunity to extend Wi-Fi's capabilities beyond communication, particularly in human sensing. As Wi-Fi signals travel through space, they modulate with the human body and undergo wave phenomena such as reflection and diffraction, which carry a rich set of information about the physical environment including human activities and gestures. This project aims to reuse commodity Wi-Fi devices to capture such wave phenomena to sense multiple persons simultaneously and to provide quantifiable gesture recognition. Exploiting commodity Wi-Fi devices for human sensing enables ubiquitous sensing for easy and large-scale deployments without requiring users to wear or install any specialized sensors. The outcome of this project can be directly adopted by industry and will have a societal impact by facilitating a variety of applications such as Human-Computer Interaction, smart home, mobile healthcare, and security surveillance. This project will lead to new technologies for human sensing and provide new insights on developing emerging mobile applications. The research activities will be integrated into Florida State University's Computer Science education program and will include curriculum development, female and minority students involvement, and K-12 education and industry outreach.

This project focuses on building a commodity Wi-Fi based ubiquitous sensing system that can simultaneously sense multiple persons and provides quantifiable gesture recognition without requiring environment-dependent training. The proposed work enables multiple people tracking and activity recognition by extracting the signal reflections from each individual person based on fine-grained signal reflection paths. The periodical change of the reflection signal is further exploited to derive quantitative measures such as the movement distance and speed for quantifiable gesture recognition. Moreover, the motion-induced Doppler effects that reflect the signal dynamic due to human body movements are leveraged to perform environment-independent sensing. Next, it applies the proposed sensing technologies to develop human-computer-interface applications by considering issues such as environmental interferences. In addition, the project expands the Wi-Fi sensing capabilities from human sensing to sensing bio-information of fruit crops. It leverages the frequency diversity to capture the physiological changes of fruit due to ripening and develops mechanisms to extract multipath-independent features for ripeness detection. Finally, the system will be evaluated using real-scale test-beds. The techniques, algorithms, and software resulting from this research will deepen our understanding of mobile sensing and provide practical value by enabling emerging applications.

"The process by which trauma experienced by one generation impacts the environment and biology of subsequent generations is referred to as ""transgenerational transmission."" This doctoral research project will examine how maternal and grandmaternal experiences of trauma impact the epigenetic DNA methylation profile of grandchildren, within a population that has experienced highly adverse social and environmental conditions. The project will advance knowledge about human biology and interactions between biology, culture and environment. Project outcomes may inform public health research and interventions for at-risk communities. The project will also support student training in a STEM field, and the research will be shared with local partners in education and health, as well as research and practice communities in early childhood development nationally and internationally. Resulting data will allow other researchers to validate or replicate findings in the growing research area of biological embedding and toxic stress. 

In recent decades, researchers have begun to investigate mechanisms that may help to explain the greater rates of psychological distress and chronic disease seen in children within populations that have experienced extreme stress and adversity. The present research will use questionnaire, hormone, and DNA methylation data to examine how maternal and grandmaternal experiences of trauma - especially those that occurred while the mother or child was in utero - impact child genetic expression and regulation of the stress response. Community-engaged research in this context provides a unique opportunity to study the transgenerational epigenetic transmission of trauma-related changes to the stress response and to learn about the risk and resilience factors that shape child development in the wake of war.

"The proposing team envisions an Engineering Research Center that will transform learning and instruction with a focus on active learning in STEM education. Current efforts to understand what takes place in such environments are limited to choosing between studies using compact, simple forms of data (such as grades or surveys), and studies employing video and written records of students' work.  Compact data provide insight but are removed from the classroom setting, while detailed record reviews are small-scale because of the labor-intensive methods required to analyze these rich, qualitative data.  The compromises associated with both strategies have severely limited progress in developing a scientific understanding of the classroom environment and using this information to impact real-world classrooms. Radically altering the way educational environments foster learning requires a multi-pronged approach bringing together researchers with expertise in cognitive and learning sciences, bio-sensing, data analytics and computer systems. The resulting engineered system will address fundamental research questions concerning how students learn best as individuals, in teams, and in classroom communities. This knowledge can subsequently be translated into practical tools to provide instructors with in-classroom insight into students' thinking and engagement in active learning environments at scale.   This ERC planning grant will facilitate the development of a team and Center structure that the National Academies of Science and Engineering believe is necessary to Advance Personalized Learning in the next century.  Knowledge developed through these tools will, in an inclusive and ethically sensitive manner, lead to advances in curriculum, pedagogy, and the design of engineered systems in support of learning and instruction.

Active learning environments with multiple concurrent conversations and activities are a challenge to study; however, understanding their dynamics is central to the advancement of learning science. Our engineering team will invent new sensors, embedded in low-power wearable computing platforms, whose data will be processed by next-generation machine learning algorithms.  The ERC planning grant will bring together researchers in convergent disciplines through workshops and data hackathons to understand the research problems and demonstrate potential technologies.  These instrumented learning environments will allow researchers to formulate and evaluate the hypotheses rapidly and at a scale well beyond that which can be achieved today. The ERC planning team will directly engage a range of stakeholders with an interest in the education of the next generation workforce. These stakeholders include students, educators, researchers, administrators, industry and accreditation agencies that will be engaged to build an ecosystem around the proposed center.

"The spatial distribution of tropical precipitation is determined by the average location and seasonal march of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The latitudinal shift of the ITCZ is typically employed as the go-to theory for interpreting past hydroclimate changes and defining mechanisms of the response to climate forcing (past and future). 

This project, however, is based on the premise that the simultaneous contraction and intensification (CI) of the ITCZ is a far more powerful mode of tropical precipitation changes (by a factor of 4) in response to both paleoclimate and anthropogenic forcing than the more commonly employed ITCZ shift.

The overarching goal of the project is to couple reconstructions of past changes in the CI mode from paleoclimate proxy records with a dynamical framework of the CI mode to constrain future tropical precipitation changes and variability. This specific aims are to: i) explore the dynamics of the CI mode to identify the mechanisms that lead to the direction of changes seen in simulations of past and future climate as well as evaluate the uncertainties in these processes and ii) use the emerging knowledge of the CI mode to reinterpret the paleoclimate record to constrain the past behavior of ITCZ shifts versus CI. 

The project would help develop a deeper understanding of the ITCZ and potentially improve the ability of climate models to forecast broad-scale future changes (and variability) in the magnitude and spatial structure topical precipitation.  The project would also support two early career scientists and leverage existing public outreach programs in science at the University of Washington and the University of California-Berkeley.","Tallahassee","Florida State University","47.050","40541","Paleoclimate","1949605","aatwood@fsu.edu","Alyssa","Atwood","09/09/2019","05/01/2019","07/31/2021","Collaborative Research: P2C2--Expansion/Contraction of the Intertropical Convergence Zone; An Emerging Mechanism of Tropical Precipitation Changes for Reinterpreting Paleoclimate","BIO"

"This three-year REU Site, ""Engineering Medical Advances at the Interface of Experiments and Computation"", at the University of South Carolina at Columbia (USC) provides a ten-week summer research experience for ten undergraduate student participants. Students will be recruited nationally and selected on the basis of their academic performance, potential and enthusiasm for conducting research, and future plans for a research career. Recruiting targets primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) at which students might not otherwise gain access to research opportunities as well as institutions with a high proportion of minority students. Research at the interface of experiments and computation will stimulate future strategies to increase the length and quality of life through preventive healthcare, early diagnostics, and therapeutics. The proposed REU site exposes young researchers, our future scientific leaders, to this interdisciplinary and collaborative research environment, which is needed to understand complex and intricate biological phenomena. In addition to research, participants will engage in enrichment activities that span science, professional development, and (bio)medical product protection/commercialization. Planned activities will broaden their exposure to experimental and computational research, with focus on strategic integration of these approaches to achieve a common goal. 

The REU Site leverages expertise of an interdisciplinary group of faculty working at the interface of experiments and computation to advance understanding of fundamental biological phenomena and biomedical technologies. The proposed research is derived from ongoing, federally funded projects as well as newly established collaborations involving junior faculty. Research efforts utilize tools and knowledge at the interface of engineering and medical advancement to gain insight into interactions among biological molecules, cells, and tissues as well as interactions between synthetic systems and biological structures. It is expected that student participants will develop valuable, lasting relationships with faculty and graduate student mentors as well as fellow researchers, which will provide resources and encouragement in their pursuit of a research career. Planned social activities will build a sense of community among mentors and participants and facilitate an informal sharing of research. During a concluding symposium, participants will formally share their research as both a poster and  oral presentation. The symposium is designed to ensure that participants complete the program with the materials necessary to present their research at a national meeting, for which travel funds are made available. Together, these elements will ensure the success of an REU Site that provides mentorship, education opportunities, and a positive perception of research to undergraduate students within an interdisciplinary setting that emphasizes experimental-computational collaboration. The unique strengths of the proposed REU Site will inspire participants and enable success in their future research endeavors.

"As the US becomes a leading producer of hydrocarbons in the world, sustainable practices are needed to leverage this new energy frontier while safeguarding against predicted water scarcity and drought. The proposed Engineering Research Center (ERC) will focus on the challenges related to hydrocarbon production. The Center will specifically address increase in water demand and wastewater sustainability as it relates to stakeholder concerns in rural and tribal communities. The planning grant aims to design the transformative systems approach needed to emphasize solutions that address social and environmental issues. The focus area is driven by the energy industry, which is responsible for up to 15% of total water withdraws worldwide. The planning grant will also bring together experts in the fields of engineering, microbiology, chemistry, environmental policy, economics, and community engagement. This team will develop an economically feasible approach, sustainable energy practices and policy, and revitalized rural communities. It will plan for an engineering system that integrates community perspectives into research, decision-making, and training with social justice, public perspectives, and multi-objective decision-making. The proposed Center will be led by the University of Tennessee with partners at Juniata College, Colorado State University, and Tennessee State University. 

The proposed ERC tackles important, complex, and socially-relevant topics such as water scarcity, energy security, and rural and tribal community development. The Center will target the ""moonshot"" initiative of treating hyper-saline O&G wastewater for industrial uses at $1/barrel. The major impact of this planning grant is to enable the effective evidence-based discussions between interdisciplinary leaders and stakeholders needed to achieve this bold target. Their input will be used to develop a sequence of wastewater management treatments designed to maximize recovery of O&G wastewater for reuse.  Implications on water conservation, energy security, and rural and tribal workforce development will help country-wide society. For the proposed wastewater treatment protocols to be successful, basic research in microbiology, microbial ecology, environmental engineering, chemistry, and material science aided by advanced computational models will be needed. The planning process will be used to build effective and active networks, strengthen ongoing research efforts, inform and empower Appalachian and Tribal communities. In addition, the planning grant will be used to establish an integrated approach to engineering education that will teach students about community engagement, policy development, and science communications. These findings could be applied to other types of industrial and agricultural waste, expanding the Center's positive impact to other aspects of the US water supply system.

"Bipedal locomotion is a hallmark trait of the human evolutionary lineage, representing a major transition away from the apes and other primates. This pivotal shift can be investigated through studies of the neck, as the human neck is adapted to balance and stabilize the head during bipedal movements. This doctoral research project will test how the shape of the bones of the neck relate to locomotion and posture in a diverse sample of mammals. The findings will be used to interpret fossilized neck bones from extinct human relatives to learn about their early forms of bipedalism, as well as potentially informing clinical research. This project will also support the sharing of three-dimensional scan data through digital repositories and the training and mentorship of student researchers, including those from groups underrepresented in scientific fields. 

Cervical vertebrae in the hominin fossil record can provide insight into the interplay between the head, neck and trunk during key locomotor and postural transitions. Currently, however, functional interpretations of these fossils are limited to broad categories such as ""human-like"" neck mobility or ""ape-like"" neck posture. The goal of this dissertation is to improve hominin neck reconstructions by experimentally testing how cervical vertebral shape relates to neck function, locomotor mode, and trunk posture. This goal will be addressed in three objectives: 1) quantify the relationship between vertebral shape and neck mobility using bending mechanics experiments, 2) develop neck posture models in living species using virtual reconstruction methods, and 3) evaluate patterns of vertebral shape change across diverse mammalian groups using phylogenetic comparative methods. The objectives will be tested in a broad sample of primates, rodents, and marsupials. These groups contain species with independently-evolved forms of bipedal locomotion and upright trunk posture, allowing for independent verification of form-function relationships. This project will provide the foundational data necessary to quantitatively interpret functional information from cervical vertebral fossils, furthering our understanding of the nature and biomechanical demands of bipedalism in early hominins.

"Corrosion is a crucial concern in applications involving metals, such as nuclear reactor vessels, pipelines, ship hulls, jet engine turbines blades, bio-metallic implants, and bridges. A longstanding challenge in corrosion science is the need to predict accurately the degradation of a given alloy or coating based on its composition and the exposure conditions.  The formation of a protective oxide scale layer is a common mechanism by which metals achieve corrosion resistance, but the formation of these scales is not well understood. Factors such as chemistry, surface conditions, and material sensitivity control oxidation behavior, but classical oxidation models lack the ability to predict whether a given alloy composition can form a continuous protective scale for a specific service environment. A primary reason for this gap in knowledge is the lack of experimental tools capable of observing the earliest stages of oxidation. This award supports the fundamental research into the atomic- and nano-scale process of alloy oxidation needed to develop practical, predictive models. The scientific understanding will accelerate materials innovations relevant to many technological areas that require sustained corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures, including energy generation, materials processing, and chemical conversion processes. This research program will contribute to national economic competitiveness through the development of novel materials and technologies, and to the development of a competitive STEM workforce through training and mentorship of graduate students and postdocs, interdisciplinary courses, and an emphasis on the participation of women and underrepresented minorities.

The evolutionary processes leading to the establishment of protective oxide scales during corrosion are critically important but depend on many intrinsic and extrinsic variables, including temperature, total pressure, nature and abundance of the reacting species, structural and chemical factors, and competitive nucleation and interfacial phenomena. This research will systematically assess the relationships among these variables to develop a detailed understanding of the establishment of protective scale formation in harsh environments including environments of high temperature and multiple oxidizing gases. The metal oxide nucleation and growth will be visualized at the atomic level using in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy. The growth kinetics and structure of the scales that eventually form will be characterized using thermal gravimetric analysis and a variety of electron microscopy techniques. These key experimental efforts, enhanced by complementary theoretical calculations, will explicate the atomic origins and critical parameters affecting the reaction pathways of protective oxide-scale formation in service-relevant environments. This combination of in situ and ex situ characterizations bridges large temporal- and spatial-scale ranges, from initial-stage oxidation to the development of the thermodynamically stable oxide. The knowledge resulting from the methodologies developed will lead to new paradigms in this important field of gas-solid surface reactions.

"Humans evolved very large brains relative to their body size, with a remarkable enrichment of neurons in the cerebral cortex. Extensive efforts in anthropology have focused on delineating the adaptive pressures that led to these changes during human evolution. However, the genetic changes underlying human brain expansion have not been fully explored. This project will test hypotheses about human brain evolution by studying the impact of human genetic variation on brain development using experimental models. This research has broad implications for understanding what makes the human brain unique at the cellular and molecular levels, with translational value for medical treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. During this research, undergraduate students pursuing careers in STEM will be mentored and trained in molecular biology and bioinformatics techniques in the laboratory. Research findings will be used as 1) an educational tool for spreading knowledge about human evolution and genetics with the general public, K-12 students, and undergraduate students, as well as 2) a motivational platform for the young, future women scientists in the Females Excelling More in Mathematics, Engineering and Science (FEMMES) Program. 

The proposed research takes a multi-disciplinary approach to investigate how human evolutionary history has shaped the molecular and physiological mechanisms of human brain expansion. In the laboratory, human and non-human primate neural cells will be studied to explore how genetic variation evolved in humans to shape the developing brain. This project uses a combination of gene editing, RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry to determine the functional role of human-specific genetic sequence during brain development that corresponds to changes in brain size. These findings will advance the understanding of the molecular evolution of the human brain.

"In recent decades, research has underscored the importance of early life experiences, especially those that occur in utero, as factors that influence biological outcomes across the life course. Growing evidence suggests that some early life biological effects, such as those triggered by psychosocial stress, can persist into adulthood and in some cases influence offspring and grandoffspring development. This doctoral research project will use existing survey data, and newly collected data and biological samples, to examine life course and intergenerational effects of early life stress experienced by now young-adult mothers who were exposed to highly adverse social conditions.  The research will advance knowledge about potential biological pathways of multigenerational effects of stress in humans, and contribute more broadly to our understanding of the complex interplay between human biology and culture. The outcomes of this project will contribute valuable data that may inform public health research and policy. The project will also support student training, international research collaborations, and science outreach activities. 

Researchers have proposed that there may be multigenerational pathways of biological ""memory"" whereby an individual's biology reflects not only their own experiences and that of their mothers, but potentially also their grandmothers' experiences. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is a central component of the body's system of stress response and is among the candidate outcomes likely to be influenced by such multigenerational plasticity. This study provides a unique opportunity to trace the long-term impacts of early life stress exposure to biological and social disparities, focusing on both the physiology and well-being of exposed individuals, and the birth outcomes and stress physiology of their unexposed offspring. This project will utilize existing and newly collected data for a cohort of women, their children, and grandchildren, that has been followed for nearly 30 years and that experienced highly adverse social and environmental conditions. The investigators will first assess long-term effects of the mother's stress experiences during her own early life on her adult biology and well-being, before exploring downstream impacts on her offspring.

"In this doctoral research project, the investigator will examine biological pathways through which exposure to social stress can affect physiological well-being. The research will focus on Native American populations who are historically understudied yet experience high levels of stress-related disparities. Stress physiology will be assessed using various biomarkers, including salivary cortisol, blood pressure (BP), and additional biometric data. Semi-structured interviews, demographic questionnaires, psychometric measures, and identity scales will be used to assess how cultural identity, psychosocial stress, historical trauma, health status and stress physiology interact. The results of this research will advance understanding of how seemingly unrelated psychological mechanisms and social environments may contribute to disparities in physiological well-being among minority populations in the United States. The project will also support student training and science outreach activities, including among groups underrepresented in STEM fields. 

This project will investigate the relationship between psychosocial stress, stress physiology, and physiological disparities by assessing: 1: the prevalence of diagnosed and suspected stress-related conditions in an Indigenous Community in the Pacific Northwest (ICPN); 2: allostatic load (chronic stress) in members of ICPN, as defined by an Allostatic Load Index (ALI) comprising neuroendocrine, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune system biomarkers; and 3: the relationship between variation in HPA-axis regulation (stress physiology) and allostatic load, and stress-related disease occurrence, Indigenous ancestry, historical trauma, and cultural identity in ICPN. This project moves away from a research focus on purely biological factors in understanding racial disparities, toward a holistic understanding of how unequal social and psychological environments negatively impact physiological well-being.

Scalable assembly of programmable multifunctional nanostructures has long been elusive. This research aims to elucidate principles of multiscale nano-structural assembly to create distinctive material properties for a broad range of applications through the novel architecture of multifunctional nanostructures. The multiscale-assembly strategy relies on physical chemistry and the mechanics of self-organization on three levels: 1) synthesis and characterization of nanocrystals; 2) density functional theory of quantum-flexoelectric crinkles in 2D-materials; and 3) variational analysis of interactions among the nanocrystals and the crinkles. The test material system is a hybrid architecture of gold nanocrystals and CdSe-CdS core-shell quantum dots for plasmon-exciton coupling, aligned by crinkles in multilayer graphene and/or hexagonal boron nitride. This interdisciplinary effort will offer some new insights in the mechanics and physics of materials at the nanoscale, as well as methods of creating novel multifunctional materials. This new fundamental knowledge will serve as a guide to elucidate the distinct roles of nano and micromechanics of materials in developing novel advanced materials.

"Kansas State University (KSU) will partner with the University of Nebraska (UN-L) and Washington State University (WSU) to plan for the Engineering Research Center for ENgineered Solutions for rUral Resilience - ENSURE: Food, Energy, Environment, and Infrastructure. ENSURE seeks to create sustainable rural communities through engineering innovations and in partnership with rural stakeholders. Rural areas are distributed across the country, and their spread out nature can enable efficient distribution of food, clean energy, and healthy environments. This is particularly important since 80% of the U.S. population lives in cities that are vulnerable to climate change, such as rising sea levels, storm surges, and heat waves. Agriculture is a key economic driver in many states and, subsequently, at the heart of many rural communities. Some examples of ENSURE's research include sustainable and profitable food production, micro-grids which harness wind energy and use solid oxide fuel cells, and recovery of nutrients from animal waste. ERC planning activities include a Research Visioning Meeting hosted at WSU in the fall, three webinars focusing on research themes, and a Facilitated Workshop hosted at KSU in the spring; all meetings will bring together academia, industry, and rural stakeholders, such as small business owners and farmers.

This ERC planning grant fundamentally questions the societal assumption that the current migration towards cities is the ideal resource distribution; investment in infrastructure and systems in rural areas could create more resilient infrastructure overall (e.g., food systems, energy resources, healthy environments). The vision of the ERC ENSURE is to generate resilient, engineered systems in conjunction with rural stakeholders, creating sufficient capacity in rural communities - across the U.S. and worldwide - to adapt and respond to shocks and adverse conditions. Using this planning grant, the team will develop a more complete vision of the rural landscape including the differences in, and relationships between, the social, political, human, and cultural capitals in conjunction with the natural, built, and financial capitals. The proposed team includes engineering (i.e., bio/ag, civil, chemical, electrical, environmental, and mechanical), public health, sociology, agricultural economics, agronomy, extension agents, geography, and regional and community stakeholders. Through a convergent approach, the team will create new intellectual merit that would not exist through parallel, discipline-based studies and disparate connections to stakeholders. This project will capture a more complete understanding of the rural landscape as defined by a wide range of stakeholders, allowing the team to understand the challenges and create better engineered solutions.  Information gained through the facilitated discussions will be used to create a detailed database. This database will paint a contemporary picture of rural landscapes, highlighting the differences in human and natural capital, and providing the information needed to make informed decisions.  The database will be used to develop multi-criteria decision support models, planning and analysis tools, and a story map. Outcomes of planning activities include 1) asking convergent, fundamental research questions; 2) forming the team using Google?s Project Aristotle framework; 3) creating a consensus regarding ERC goals; and 4) generating an informational geospatial database to serve as the foundation of story maps to communicate the information.

"Non-Technical Abstract:
Biological cells are a fundamental unit of life that can harvest energy from the environment in various form, use that energy to sustain their metabolism, and direct that energy to power cellular tasks. Motility, i.e., the ability to produce controlled directional motion of a cell as a whole, is of paramount importance for the cell's ability to survive and explore its environment. Just like man-made machines use motors to enable them to move, cells use ATP-powered molecular motors to generate mechanical work. A much less explored, yet surprisingly powerful motility pathway involves propulsion-powered by osmotic energy, in which a cell directs water channels to defined regions of its membrane, and uses the resulting water fluxes in presence of external, even uniform, osmotic gradient to propel itself like a mini-rocket through aqueous environment.  This project will explore the fundamental physical principles of this process by recapitulating the key elements of this motility apparatus in a model synthetic system comprised from large enclosed proto-cellular membrane compartments- giant unilamellar vesicles- and efficient synthetic water channels- carbon nanotube porins. Precisely controlled phase segregation in the vesicle shell will drive the water channels to a particular vesicle region and generate asymmetric propulsion. This project will explore the possibility of generating sustained propulsion by using multiple recharge cycles, as well as explore the effects of crowding and emergent collective behavior in the ensembles of these osmotically-propelled proto-cells. In addition, this project will provide research, training and educational opportunities to high school and undergraduate students for a better understanding of modern biomaterials research.  In particular, the project will offer opportunities in biomimetic materials research through targeted outreach efforts and presentations to K-12 STEM summer program participants in California Central Valley region.  It will also enable participation by undergraduate researchers through the Vertically Integrated Program (https://vip.ucdavis.edu), which allows them to work in single labs for several quarters.

Technical Abstract: 
Cell migration is ubiquitous in biology. During motility, cells acquire a spatial asymmetry - a polarized morphology characterized by a clear distinction between the cell front and the rear - allowing them to convert energy-dissipative intracellular forces, generated in response to environmental stimuli, into net movement. In addition to ATP-consuming cytoskeleton remodeling to drive polarity and cell motility, an alternate process involves the emergence of cell polarity through active positioning of membrane channels, which in conjunction with asymmetric water fluxes under osmotic gradients generate a net propulsive force. This EAGER proposal seeks to recapitulate this essential mechanism into synthetic giant vesicles towards developing design principles for a broad general class of far-from-equilibrium materials that move, flow, or swim in response to changes in their environment. The investigators articulate a high-risk, high-reward experiments that test their central hypothesis that directional fluxes of water across vesicular compartments facilitated by asymmetric spatial distribution of highly-efficient water channels (aquaporins or carbon nanotube porins) can isothermally transduce osmotic energy into a vectorial propulsion. To address this hypothesis, three aims will be pursued: (1) Preparation and characterization of water-channel embedding vesicular compartments that exhibit cell-like polarity; (2) demonstration of self-propulsion of polarized giant vesicles in response to imposed osmotic gradients; and (3) study emergent, cooperative behaviors in populations of closely interacting, motile giant vesicles. The broader technical impact of this project benefits from a combination of concepts from the fields of soft matter, membrane biophysics, and bio-inspired materials that address fundamental interdisciplinary questions surrounding the design of model protocellular configurations, biomimicry, novel principles for material synthesis, and understanding the rules of life.

"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY

This award supports theoretical, data-intensive, and computational research and education in granular materials with implications for nano-particle assemblies, glassy materials, biomaterials, and liquid crystals. Guessing how many candies there are in a jar is an ancient mathematical problem that occupied the minds of the greatest mathematicians, from Gauss, Kepler and Hilbert, over centuries. Mathematically, this problem is known as the ""optimal packing problem"" and asks to optimize the filling density of objects of a particular shape occupying a given volume. For example: What is the maximum number of candies of a given shape that can be packed in a jar? Nowadays, interest in the general problem emanates from its practical importance to industries involved in granular media processing and appear in a broad range of science and engineering fields such as self-assembly of nano-particles, liquid crystals, glassy and bio-materials. In fact, understanding the structural and mechanical behavior of packings from the properties of its individual constituents is a central problem in modern materials science.

In this project, the PI will develop theoretical models supplemented with computational tests to design packing generation protocols and algorithms which can explore the larger space of parameters in search for the optimal packing.

The algorithms and theories developed by the PI would lead to a deeper understanding of the packing optimization problem and benefit many industrial sectors, especially pharmaceutical and chemical industries which rely on storage and transport of large amounts of granular material, as well as in the oil industry. The PI will address these problems in industry relevant scenarios and explore novel states of matter due to particle shape.  

The potentially transformative aspect of this EAGER project is to go beyond the state-of-the-art theory on granular matter by applying novel trends in artificial intelligence through machine learning algorithms and network theory. This combination of theoretical approaches is high risk-high payoff and brings together different ideas into an interdisciplinary framework to make progress on the packing problem in materials science.

The PI aims to recruit minority students from CCNY to participate in the project. This project includes international collaborations. The PI will disseminate data on all the packings and software generated in the project.


TECHNICAL SUMMARY

This award supports theoretical research and education on granular and soft matter. The overall aim of this project is to develop a unifying theoretical and numerical framework to predict the structural and mechanical properties of random packings of particles of arbitrary shapes. The goal of the project is two-fold: first, to investigate and discover organizing principles of granular states of matter, and second, to design new granular materials with optimized predefined properties.  To do this, the PI will first develop a theoretical framework to predict the packing fraction of assemblies of non-spherical particles such as composite molecules of rigidly bonded spheres, polymer-like chains, tetrahedra and irregular polyhedra in general, and then test the space of parameters with computational tools based on network theory and machine learning. These results will allow the PI to search for optimal packings of predetermined characteristics, for example denser packings with maximal rigidity by variation of the shape of the anisotropic building blocks.

The potentially transformative aspect of this Eager project is to go beyond the state-of-the-art theory on granular matter by applying novel trends in artificial intelligence through machine learning algorithms and network theory. This combination of theoretical approaches is high risk-high payoff and brings together different ideas into an interdisciplinary framework to make progress on the packing problem in materials science.

"Nutritional and energetic models of human metabolism assume that all dietary fats have the same caloric value. However, recent developments in gut microbiome research have challenged this view, with gut microbial communities shifting in response to different fat-rich diets, and the resulting gut microbiota differentially impacting energy gain. This dissertation project will examine the role of dietary fat types on energy gain from a human holobiont perspective, which interrogates both host and microbial mechanisms of energy harvest from different dietary fat sources. By assessing the impact of dietary fat type on host-microbial interactions, the investigators aim to better understand the process of dietary fat metabolism in ancestral and modern humans, to challenge traditional models of the isocaloric nature of fats, and to gain insight into associations between dietary fat intake and increasing rates of metabolic disease in industrial populations. Apart from contributing to the peer-reviewed scientific literature, this research will facilitate undergraduate research opportunities, particularly for women and underrepresented minorities in science, who presently comprise 80% of the laboratory research staff. In addition, through connections with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, the investigators have committed to contributing to programs that make science accessible for a broad public audience. 

The trillions of microbes that reside in the human gut are now understood to play important roles in digestion and energy regulation. However, to date, models of past and present human energy budgets have not considered the microbial contributions to energy harvested from diet. In this research, the investigators will probe mechanisms of dietary fat metabolism that involve both host and microbial processes, evaluating the impacts of different dietary fats on host energy budget, intestinal fat absorption and inflammation, gut microbial composition, and direct gut microbial contributions to host energy status. To address these processes, the investigators will use conventional and germ-free murine models, which are routinely used for studying the effects of microbial community shifts on human physiology. This research will clarify the role that different dietary fats have played in the evolution of human energy metabolism, and will suggest new pathways for targeting the high and rising rates of obesity, type II diabetes, and other metabolic diseases in the industrialized world.

"Soil is a global resource that supports most of our urban infrastructure, acts as a conduit for groundwater and is the dominant material in many of the world's geohazards.  Understanding the in-situ state of soil (stress level, stiffness, strength, permeability) is essential to inform effective and efficient decisions about how humans should interact with soil deposits.  Most current geotechnical measuring instruments involve vertical penetration of a probe into the soil to a shallow depth (up to a few hundred meters).  Usually, the probe records only one type of data at a time (e.g. a displacement, a moisture content or a thermal gradient), in a very localized area.  Consequently, the ground models used in decision-making rely on interpolation between relatively sporadic data points and consider relevant parameters (mechanical, hydraulic, thermal) separately.  The Burrowing Robot with Integrated Sensing System (BRISS) builds on insight gained in designing Cone Penetration Test modifications and the more recent development of small prototype burrowing robots at the Georgia Institute of Technology (GT). The research objectives are to: (i) design, build and deploy a burrowing robotized sensor delivery system; (ii) sense mechanical and physical signals during the burrowing process and use machine-learning to adapt the burrowing process and the sensing strategy; (iii) interpret soil signals using particulate mechanics, tribology, large deformation continuum mechanics models and feature selection algorithms.  The research group at GT, in collaboration with the research group at Imperial College London (ICL) in the UK, will collaborate to achieve the research objectives and to co-advise a cohort of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.  The BRISS will achieve a paradigm shift in soil exploration and site characterization.  Both the sensor modules and the propulsion sections of the BRISS will be stackable, so that probes can be built up with different combinations of modules or the same modules but in different configurations.  The BRISS will be minimally wired, thus the project findings will pave the way towards wireless, remotely controlled, multi-directional subsurface sensing.  Such technologies will ultimately enable deep sediment characterization and extra-terrestrial exploration.  The long-term deployment of multi-sensing probes could be used to detect variations of soil properties that are independent from localized probe stimuli, such as pH change consequent to mining activities or pore pressure change consequent to repeated droughts.  The PIs will use GT and ICL institutional organizations to recruit students from under-represented minorities. They will engage with the ALERT Geomaterials network and GT Society of Women Engineers to attract female students. The lead-PI will participate in outreach activities for promoting the inclusion of the LGBTQ community in engineering and will facilitate Safe Space training for all the project team members.

Challenges associated with obtaining undisturbed samples mean that probes that can measure these properties in-situ are incredibly useful.  Informed by recent prototyping work at GT, the team will develop a novel multi-sensor system, BRISS, which will incorporate several major advances: (a) the use of soft robot and micro-controls to enable probes to navigate in any orientation in the subsurface; (b) the ability of these probes to self-propel through the soil using peristaltic motion; (c) the incorporation of multiple micro-sensors in these semi-autonomous probes; and (d) the leveraging of machine learning algorithms into the data analysis and soil model development.  Recently developed experimental techniques will be used to refine and optimize the propulsion mechanism; these include novel textures, bio-inspired anchors, soil ablation mechanisms and self-lubrication processes.  Innovative sensor systems will be designed and evaluated to optimize the set of measurements, with a particular focus on stress, stress wave velocity and acoustic emissions.  Novel deep reinforcement machine learning algorithms will be used to refine the burrowing trajectory and adapt the frequency at which in situ measures are taken.  Feature selection algorithms will be enhanced to handle large data sets for interpreting stress, pore pressure, geophysical and acoustic signals.  This project will also provide fundamental understanding of the physical and mechanical response of dry and water-saturated sand during the penetration of the self-propelled BRISS.  For the first time, multi-scale numerical models will decipher burrowing mechanics, by combining discrete element models that will include peristaltic boundary conditions, particle interaction and multi-scale tribological models that will shed light on the robot/soil interface rheology, and large-deformation finite element hydro-mechanical elasto-plastic models that will be applicable to predict soil behavior at larger scales.

This project was awarded through the ""Signals in the Soil (SitS)"" opportunity, a collaborative solicitation that involves the United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA) and the following United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI) research councils: 1) The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), 2) the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  (BBSRC), 3) the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).

"The above-ground portion of plants has been almost exclusively studied largely due to imaging difficulties associated with soil-growing roots. Thus, little is known about the interaction of root architectures and substrates critical to plant health.  The root system is amenable to integrated study of a living system across length and organizational scales, linking genomic to micro and macroscopic phenotypic traits and control behaviors. Plant root systems are vital for nutrient and water absorption, anchoring and support as well as soil conditioning. Such systems couple space and time to achieve excellence in complex spatial environments. Roots must grow from a seed into a complex network structure via cell division without central planning of optimal paths, adjusting to interactions with substrates of varying particle size, moisture, and compaction. Recently, advances in genetics and sequencing coupled with imaging in soil and gel-based soil mimics have begun to elucidate principles. However, real time interaction dynamics and control decisions for such processes are largely unknown. The terradynamic aspects of tip-growth interactions between root and soil are also largely unstudied. In this collaborative proposal two experts, Goldman in biomechanics, robophysics and soft matter physics, and Benfey in plant development, genetics and genomics, will work to discover principles of effective root exploration, penetration and anchoring. The proposed work will focus on the genetically well-characterized model system, rice, subjecting multiple cultivars to a suite of comparative and integrative experimental assays coupled with robophysical and computational models. A better understanding of root system development is an important step towards increasing crop yields in poor soils, critical in the face of rapid climate change. Interaction with Atlanta Botanical Gardens to study orchid growth will facilitate the Garden's conservation activities. Given the PIs' past success in interfacing with the public via popular press and interaction with local museums and schools, it is expected that the physics of plants (including robophysics) can be used to generate broad interest in plant science in a way that pure botany or plant genetics cannot.

To discover novel interactions, dynamics and genes, root growth will be monitored across length and time scales, imaging with x-ray and gel systems (to study root tip dynamic growth behaviors) and confocal microscopy (for cell division and elongation) varying different soil properties and heterogeneities in well-controlled laboratory soil-mimics. Insight into root growth behaviors will be obtained via time-dependent stresses such as compacted or loose soil, as well as changes in nutrient availability. Questions associated with control of growth via cellular changes (e.g. root thickening) in response to changes in environment (e.g. soil compaction) will be of interest. Such perturbations will be complemented by utilizing genetic mutants to study how root dynamics change upon modification of key behaviors such as circumnutation. To more accurately model aspects of the living systems, the collaboration will develop experimentally validated computational models of tip-driven biological growth, calibrating the soft-matter interaction aspects of the simulation via mechanical tests and robot experiments.

"The Planning Grants for Engineering Research Centers competition was run as a pilot solicitation within the ERC program.  Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.

This Engineering Research Center planning grant will bring together biological and other scientists, engineers and other stakeholders from industry to develop biologically based approaches to building energy systems.  This project views buildings as living, breathing organisms (coupled fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, water and moisture transfer, complex control systems, etc.) to identify biological strategies that can enable novel mechanisms for enhancing energy and material efficiency of the built environment, a process referred to as Biologically Inspired Design (BID). For instance, polar bears and whales adapt extremely well to cold environments using multifaceted and precisely controlled insulation schemes that can inspire new designs for adaptable building skins.  The ERC planning grant participants will learn and employ deep BID methods that converge biological sciences with engineering to provide new approaches for a) fundamental energy systems technology components such as heat exchangers, pumps, insulation, building skins, energy storage, b) inspiration for new building technologies that integrate the various components with biologically inspired control systems, c) ecosystems of buildings that provide even larger energy reductions through symbiotic interaction of bio-inspired buildings. A radical shift in building technologies is critical to achieve the carbon emission reductions required to avoid the effects of worsening climate. Residential and commercial buildings account for about 40% of total U.S. energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and more than 70% of electricity use. This planning grant will accelerate the use of BID to improve the material and energy use efficiency of buildings throughout their life from construction to operation to re- or de-commissioning.

The rationale for using biologically inspired design (BID) approach for a) building energy components, b) building design and c) ecosystems of buildings is that at all levels of organization, biological systems employ different strategies that have evolved under stringent penalties for material and energy inefficiency. Identifying functions in biological systems analogous to functions required in buildings, and the translating those biological mechanisms (""solution principles"") to human devices and processes will yield commensurate benefits at all scales, from internal processes in individual building energy systems to communities of buildings.  To enable the BID approach, the participants of activities funded by this planning grant will learn a series of analogical based design techniques (problem decomposition, functional extraction, assessment of analogical matching etc) and apply these methods to the problem of building energy management. The goal is to leverage biological ""solution principles"" to identify novel and effective ways of reducing the energy required to construct and operate buildings while ensuring they are comfortable for their human occupants. Solution principles from natural systems emphasize material hierarchy, adaptive use of information and feedback, distributed decision making and other operating methods, all of which are novel in the context of human solutions and are less intensive in their use of material and energy. In addition to identifying potential solution principles, participants will use analogical evaluation techniques to determine best matches between biological solutions and existing problems, and use targeted searches of the biological and engineering/science literature to determine the barriers (both conceptual and technical) that stand in the way of developing innovative biologically-inspired solutions. These activities will result in determining the ERC guiding questions, personnel, and approaches necessary to achieve enabling technologies and will create a community of biological and other scientists, engineers and end users equipped with the necessary skills to apply BID to design and retrofits of buildings.

"The project focuses on swarming cyber-physical systems (swarming CPS) consisting of a collection of mobile networked agents, each of which has sensing, computing, communication, and locomotion capabilities, and that have a wide range of civilian and military applications. Different from conventional static CPS, swarming CPS rely on mobile computing entities, e.g., robots, which collaboratively interact with phenomena of interest at different physical locations. This unique feature calls for novel sensing-motion co-design solutions to accomplish a variety of increasingly complex missions. Towards this, the overall research objective of this project is to establish and demonstrate a generic motion-sensing co-design procedure that will significantly reduce the complexity of the mission design for swarming CPS, and greatly facilitate the development of effective, efficient and adaptive control and sensing strategies under various environment uncertainties. This project aims to offer comprehensive scientific understanding of the dynamic nature of swarming CPS, contribute to generic engineering principles for designing collaborative control and sensing algorithms, and advance the enabling technologies of practically applying CPS in the challenging environment. The research solutions of this project aim to bring significant advance in the environmental sustainability, homeland security, and human well-being. The project provides unique interdisciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students through both research work and related courses that the PIs will develop and offer. 

The project significantly advances the state of the art in cooperative control and sensing and provide an enabling technology for swarming CPS through highly interrelated thrusts: (1) a generic sensing and motion co-design procedure, which reveals the fundamental interplay between the sensing dynamics and motion dynamics of swarming CPS, will be proposed to facilitate the development of effective and efficient control and sensing strategies; (2) by following such co-design procedure, provable correct, computation efficient, and communication light control and sensing strategies will be developed for swarming CPS with constrained resources to accomplish specific missions, e.g., locating pollutants, in an unknown field, while navigating through uncertain spaces; (3) to provide an enabling mobile platform to verify the proposed strategies, innovative small, highly 3D maneuverable, noiseless, energy-efficient, and robust robotic fish fully actuated by smart material will be designed to meet the maneuvering requirements of the proposed algorithms; (4) novel Magnetic Induction (MI)-based underwater communication and localization solutions will be developed, which allows robotic fish to timely and reliably exchange messages, while simultaneously providing accurate inter-fish localization in the harsh 3D underwater environment; and (5) the proposed sensing-motion co-design strategies will be verified and demonstrated using a school of wirelessly interconnected robotic fish in both lab-based experiments and field experiments.","Arlington","University of Texas at Arlington","47.070","107651","CPS-Cyber-Physical Systems","1936599","animesh.chakravarthy@uta.edu","Animesh","Chakravarthy","08/13/2019","05/22/2019","12/31/2019","CPS: Synergy: Collaborative Research: Towards Effective and Efficient Sensing-Motion Co-Design of Swarming Cyber-Physical Systems","BIO"

"The Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) project seeks to increase our understanding of the crucial role of the Southern Ocean in taking up anthropogenic carbon and heat from the atmosphere, and resupplying nutrients from the abyss to the surface. An observational component, based on deployment of profiling floats with oxygen, nitrate, pH and bio-optical sensors, is supplying unprecedented amounts of new biogeochemical data that provide a year-round view of the Southern Ocean from the surface to 2000 meters water depth, including tracking ocean acidification, deoxygenation, and warming processes. A modeling effort is applying these observations and enhancing our understanding of the modern Southern Ocean, and reducing uncertainty in projections of future carbon and nutrient cycles and climate. An extension of this program from six to ten years is requested. This may allow illumination of the Southern Ocean's role in climate that was not possible with a shorter time scale and allows regional comparisons with sufficient floats and years of data to elucidate the different processes that may operate in each basin. The project will communicate data and results quickly to the wider community through established data networks, publications, websites, and social media, as well as through an active outreach program to classrooms, the general public, and policymakers. A second goal is to train a new generation of diverse ocean scientists versed in field techniques,data calibration, modeling, and communication of research to non-scientists. A third goal completes the transfer of new sensor technology and related software to industry partners. 

Because the Southern Ocean serves as the primary gateway through which the intermediate, deep, and bottom waters of the ocean connect with the surface ocean (and thus the atmosphere), it has a profound  influence on the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon and heat as well as nutrient resupply from the  abyss to the surface. The four year extension of the SOCCOM float program proposed here will allow examination of the Southern Ocean's response to critical modes of climate variability including ENSO and the Southern Annular Mode. This also contributes to the development and analysis of fully coupled climate and earth system models that can represent mesoscale processes in the Southern Ocean, as well as corresponding models that assimilate observations to produce a  biogeochemical state estimate.

"The University of Southern Mississippi (USM) School of Polymer Science and Engineering's (SPSE) RET Site for Sustainable Polymer Engineering Research (RET) will host local community college instructors and high school teachers for a six-week summer research experience with polymer science and engineering faculty to perform research in the area of sustainable materials.  Teachers will work in pairs with faculty and student researchers in efforts focused on addressing 21st century grand challenges in engineering in three areas: (1) reducing waste through design of degradable and bio-based polymers, (2) improving water quality through polymer sensors and delivery vehicles, and (3) enabling alternative energy approaches with high performance polymers. The goal is to build professional relationships between faculty researchers and local teachers to improve teacher and student understanding of materials research, and promote student interest in science and engineering.  Science and engineering are crucial for the nation's sustained economic strength and security, and there is a critical shortage of U.S. students pursuing engineering careers today. The proposed research in sustainable materials has direct impact on the key economic drivers in the State of Mississippi in areas that are highly relevant to teachers, students, and their families. Teachers will gain appreciation for polymer engineering by working in the laboratory, attending short courses, touring the research facilities, taking field trips to local polymer industry, and attending faculty research presentations.  Teachers will develop activities and laboratory modules based on their summer research for implementation in their classrooms.  USM faculty and graduate students will visit teacher classrooms during the school year to help in delivery of the research-based activities. It is expected that interaction with graduate students (who are closer in age to community college and high school students) will help encourage K-14 students to pursue studies and careers in science and engineering.  Teachers will make their curricular modules available to other teachers by publishing them on the RET website, demonstrating them at the MS Science Teachers Association Annual Meeting, and publishing in Teach Engineering. Teachers will be recruited from institutions with high minority and poverty-level underserved student populations, to help broaden participation in science and engineering.  


The sustainable materials engineering research platform of the RET site provides the framework to build long-term relationships between engineering faculty and teachers while providing cutting-edge research experiences that are readily incorporated into high school and community college science curricula. The increasing demand for energy and use of hydrocarbons create a wide range of issues, such as the Deepwater Horizon BP Oil Spill of 2010 off the Mississippi Gulf Coast, as well as opportunities, such as production of biodegradable polymers and alternative energy development, which have high impact on Mississippi teachers and students. The proposed RET will immerse high school teachers and community college faculty in sustainable polymer engineering research in efforts aligned with the National Academy 21st Century Grand Challenges of Engineering, including providing access to clean water and making solar energy affordable. Teachers will develop research-based classroom modules aligned with the MS College and Career Readiness Standards for Science. The proposed effort is transformative in providing avenues to engage the public in the impact of sustainable materials engineering research through relevant research experiences that will resonate with teachers, students and parents. The proposed research has direct impact on the key economic drivers in the State of Mississippi: energy, agriculture, and marine/coastal activities. Teachers will gain hands-on experience in the processes by which materials research addresses sustainability challenges and will develop tools to engage students in the engineering enterprise, encouraging them to pursue science and engineering careers. Teachers will be recruited from schools with high minority and free and reduced lunch student populations, and research modules will be broadly disseminated. A week-long workshop for middle school teachers will be implemented to broaden the reach of the program to younger students.

"This award provides funding to acquire an atomic layer deposition system at the University of Texas in Dallas to enable fundamental research in three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure devices. The acquisition of the instrument will foster a wide range of research activities spanning nanoelectronics,  energy storage, photonics and biomedical devices. The proposed tool will advance the research capabilities by providing conformal metal and nitride deposition on complex 3D and temperature sensitive substrates. Metals and nitrides are the building blocks of many device architectures, and these materials serve to enable robust performance and integrity in real world applications. The instrument facilitates highly conformal deposition on high-aspect ratio structures, that are ubiquitous with novel device structures and could be tailored to meet the specifications dictated by end usage. This system will be instrumental in shaping and training graduate and undergraduate students, researchers, post-docs, and scientists invested in nano-device research, encompassing a substantial number of underrepresented minority and women in STEM. A fringe benefit would be the availability of properly trained task force for employment opportunities in the field of semiconductor technology and device processing in the rapidly growing Dallas-DFW metroplex area and the US.

The plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) system utilizes a remote plasma to generate high energy radicals while minimizing plasma damage on sensitive substrates and enabling nitride and metal deposition at low temperatures. The coating ability is enhanced by increasing the pressure and exposure time in the reaction chamber using a unique diffusion enhancer. This system provides unprecedented capability for uniform deposition on highly porous substrates with aspect ratio up to 1:10,000. It is also useful in designing next-generation 3D structured nano-devices. For example, advanced 3D stacked semiconductor devices, ultra-high density energy storage devices, gain-assisted hyperbolic metamaterials for super-resolution imaging, and shape-morphing 3D elastomer bio/med-devices, etc. require conformal metal and dielectric coating, that can be deposited by PE-ALD. This new PE-ALD system will also support the research projects in numerous flourishing and established electronic/medical device companies nationwide.

"This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a state-of-the-art three-dimensional flow measurement system to enhance Purdue Northwest's capacity to conduct fundamental research and foster multidisciplinary research collaborations, including those with regional industries.   The award will give faculty and more than 50 undergraduate and graduate students-- particularly female and first-generation university students-- access to state-of-the art instrumentation. The research will provide new knowledge leading to advances in renewable energy, regenerative medicine and the development of micro air vehicles.

The instrumentation will serve as a catalyst for fundamental research on complex flows. Flow phenomena are fundamental to a range of important multidisciplinary research problems including turbulence, bio-fluid mechanics, and wind energy. These phenomena are naturally three-dimensional with complexities that previous flow measurement techniques, such as digital PIV, were unable to resolve.  The instrumentation's particle tracking capabilities allow complex three-dimensional flow to be measured and characterized with high spatial resolution and accuracy. This will enable the researchers to gain a new understanding of three-dimensional fundamental flow physics, such as the lift generation/augmentation mechanisms in flapping flight.

"This project supports the fundamental research that aims to harness elastic multi-stability and transform the design and dynamic control of compliant and continuous robots (aka. ""soft robots"").  The ongoing advances in bio-mimicry, material science, fabrication technology, and control theory are enabling us to build genuinely soft robots that can collaborate with humans in unstructured and dynamic task environments.  These robots are significantly superior and safer than the traditional rigid robots in disaster relief efforts, minimal-invasive surgeries, and assistive healthcare.  However, the compliant and continuous nature of soft robots, as well as the fact that they are severely underactuated, imposes significant challenges for effective dynamic modeling and control.   This research will, for the first time, systematically examine the use of multi-stability in soft robots to address these critical challenges.  Multi-stability can create a ""mechanical intelligence"" in the body of a soft robot because it can coordinate (or sequence) the robotic motion and re-configure the state-space without relying on any digital controllers.  In this way, one can directly ""outsource"" the low-level control tasks to the robotic body and formulate a hybrid mechanical-digital approach for dynamic modeling and control with unprecedented efficiency and effectiveness.  The project will also sup-port different educational activities, such as using origami folded robots as the teaching tool, to in-spire and prepare students for their future career in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields. 

This research will formulate an integrated framework, e.g., dynamic modeling, design, and fabrica-tion,- to unleash the potential of the aforementioned mechanical intelligence by multi-stability.  The research team will use origami as the physical platform and complete a hierarchy of research tasks:  1) modeling and fabrication of robotic modules with prescribed and adaptive bi-stability;  2) design and validation of robotic components with embedded mechanical intelligence, and 3) con-struction of full robots with an interface between mechanical and digital intelligence.  To complete these research tasks, the research team will derive new dynamic models for the bistable origami modules by expanding the absolute nodal coordinate formulation, develop design methodologies based on multi-objective optimization algorithms, and use responsive materials such as shape memory polymers to ensure the versatility and robustness of mechanical intelligence.  Upon com-pletion, the research team will deliver demonstration robots that exploit the hybrid mechanical-digital intelligence for locomotion or manipulation.  In these robots, the lower-level control tasks (such as locomotion gait generation) are executed by the embedded intelligence in the mechanical domain, while the high-level tasks (such as changing locomotion direction and speed according to the working environment) are achieved by sensors and controllers in the digital domain.

"This workshop brings together a group of approximately 40 experts from academia and industry, and an additional 60 experts, policy makers, and funders across US Government for a two-day workshop. The workshop is then be followed by a half day meeting of US Government experts, policy makers and funders. The anticipated end-result of the workshop is the refinement and eventual adoption of a synthetic biology roadmap for the United States government along with recommendations for future coordination. The workshop discussions contribute significantly to a broader comprehensive strategy that would establish the United States as a leader in the area of synthetic biology as well as promote the enhancement and improvement of scientific, engineering and educational activities by bringing together a leading group of experts from several scientific domains. The meeting establishes the foundation for increased collaboration and coordination among United States Government Agencies. The workshop includes attendees from underrepresented groups in Science and Technology and attendees who are at all stages of their career.

Synthetic Biology activities across all agencies in the United States Federal Government span from basic research into the biology of genetic mechanisms and cellular function; to evolution of synthetic organisms and their impact on the environment; to development of foundational tools that enable cell manipulation, design and control; to development of applications in health and disease treatment, remote manufacturing, bio-renewable fuels and chemicals, and adaptive living materials; to the robust and reproducible manufacture of products of synthetic biology in a commercial setting. This workshop brings together key stakeholders from academia, industry and funding agencies to help improve coordination in ways that will advance the field of synthetic biology. The workshop builds on the publication of the Engineering Biology Research Consortium roadmap, released in June 2019, and would identify opportunities for future collaboration and coordination in ways that will advance the field. This workshop represents the first examination of a United States technology-based roadmap, and as such, the workshop provides an opportunity for the US policy makers and researchers to strategically plan for the future of the field of synthetic biology.

"An unprecedented opportunity to advance understanding of the biological rules that govern the diversity and dynamics of life now exists thanks to the large quantity and variety of data that are becoming increasingly available.  This goal of understanding biodiversity dynamics is enabled at a critical moment when human systems are disrupting those very dynamics. However, the scientific and computational tools needed to derive understanding from data are still missing.  Such tools need to be accessible to a broad community of users, thereby catalyzing involvement and innovation.  This project will (1) build a computational model for multiple aspects of biodiversity-species abundance, genetic, functional, and phylogenetic; (2) use and refine this model by testing major hypotheses about the generation and maintenance of biodiversity in three exemplar systems; (3) make the model accessible to the scientific community by building an open-source platform to prepare diverse data sources and run the model; and (4) create pedagogically effective courses and workshops to enable students, researchers, and stakeholders from many backgrounds to understand biodiversity theory and the data science tools needed to test those theories with data.

The Rules of Life Engine (RoLE) model will be a mechanistic, simulation-based hypothesis-testing and data synthesis framework enabling scientists with multi-dimensional biodiversity data to generate and test hypotheses about the processes driving biodiversity patterns. The RoLE model will apply new techniques in machine learning to fit models to high dimensional, cross-scale data. The model will simulate eco-evolutionary community assembly building from individual-based ecological and genetic neutral models with added non-neutral, trait-based competition and environmental filtering. New species and traits will arise through long time scale evolution in the meta-community and rapid evolution in the local community. Population genetics and species abundances in the local community will be modeled through birth, death, immigration, and mutation. The project research team will refine and illustrate the use of the RoLE model by testing four hypothesized rules of life across three bio-geographic systems for which multi-scale biodiversity data are now available. The hypotheses address the relative roles of immigration versus speciation in community assembly, how species interactions influence diversity, how different assembly histories determine the strength of species interactions, and whether/how systems come to equilibrium. The project leaders have established a network of 14 collaborators, including the National Ecological Observatory Network, who will use the RoLE model in their diverse systems and propagate wider adoption. In order to further reduce barriers to use, the RoLE model framework will be made available as open source software, including an R language Shiny App interface with standardized metadata outputs to promote reproducibility and sharing. The insights gained from the RoLE model are of direct relevance to conservation, e.g., whether or not communities are assembled primarily by speciation or immigration strongly determines their response to anthropogenic pressures and optimal conservation management. To encourage participation in quantitative biodiversity research, the project leaders will develop a massively open online course through the Santa Fe Institute?s Complexity Explorer program using the RoLE model as an interactive teaching tool. In conjunction with Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry, the research team will also provide an in-person data science training workshop.

The project research team will refine and illustrate the use of the RoLE model by testing four hypothesized rules of life across three bio-geographic systems for which multi-scale biodiversity data are now available. The hypotheses address the relative roles of immigration versus speciation in community assembly, how species interactions influence diversity, how different assembly histories determine the strength of species interactions, and whether/how systems come to equilibrium. The project leaders have established a network of 14 collaborators, including the National Ecological Observatory Network, who will use the RoLE model in their diverse systems and propagate wider adoption. In order to further reduce barriers to use, the RoLE model framework will be made available as open source software, including an R language Shiny App interface with standardized metadata outputs to promote reproducibility and sharing. The insights gained from the RoLE model are of direct relevance to conservation, e.g., whether or not communities are assembled primarily by speciation or immigration strongly determines their response to anthropogenic pressures and optimal conservation management. To encourage participation in quantitative biodiversity research, the project leaders will develop a massively open online course through the Santa Fe Institute?s Complexity Explorer program using the RoLE model as an interactive teaching tool. In conjunction with Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry, the research team will also provide an in-person data science training workshop. Results from the RoLE project can be found at https://role-model.github.io.

"Chemical signaling among microorganisms in the soil determines microbial behavior, including whether or not soil microbes suppress plant diseases, enhance crop growth, or grow on particular soil nutrients.  However, little is known about the specific chemical signals that mediate these behaviors, limiting the potential for practical management to optimize microbial activities to support healthy crops and ecosystems. The objectives of this project at the University of Minnesota and the University of Manchester in the UK are to develop and test a set of 100 novel, microbial recorders that can sense specific signals and report on whether each of 100 particular genes in the microbe responds.  This project will provide a valuable means of identifying specific chemical signals among soil microbes that can optimize beneficial functions or suppress detrimental functions.  The research will shed light on the complex chemical and metabolic interactions that determine how well soil microbiomes can support healthy crops and ecosystems, and provide insight into novel, practical ways to harness microbiomes for beneficial functions.  Tools created here will also guide improvements in understanding the ecology and functional potential of soil microbiomes in agricultural and natural habitats.  Exchanges between U.S. and U.K. scientists will be integral to the success of the research effort, strengthening the capacities and output of scientists in both countries.  

The research will provide fundamental insights into the roles of signals in mediating the ecology of soil microbes and suppression of plant diseases. This work establishes a foundation for engineering functional soil microbiomes for precision agriculture.  Specific objectives are to:  1) Develop and test genetic recorder (GR) strains to ""listen and report"" on signals in the soil that regulate primary and secondary metabolic pathways in Streptomyces spp. isolated from disease suppressive soils;  2) Model and test how species-species interactions that rely on primary and secondary metabolic induction impact multi-species communities;  and 3) Discover effects of potential signals on Streptomyces metabolism and harness signals to optimize microbial functional capacities in soil.  Methods:  1) GRs will be created to detect the activation of genes/pathways of interest in soil microbes using serine integrase-mediated recombination.  The GRs will be quantified using Next-Generation Sequencing technology, and will be able to simultaneously record the activation of hundreds of metabolic activities in a single high-throughput experiment.  2) Genome-scale metabolic models, transcriptomics, and metabolomics will be used to connect signals to functions.  Existing metabolic modeling platforms will be extended to incorporate novel functionality to understand how signals influence the physiology of individual bacteria and alter emergent ecosystem dynamics.  3) Potential signals will be screened for their direct effects on Streptomyces antibiotic inhibitory and nutrient use phenotypes in vitro, providing both a signal discovery platform and a direct comparison with phenotypic data.  

This project was awarded through the ""Signals in the Soil (SitS) opportunity, a collaborative solicitation that involves the ENG/CBET and BIO/IOS divisions of the National Science Foundation (NSF), the United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA) and the following United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI) research councils: 1) The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), 2) the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), 3) the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).

"Energy harvesting using oscillating foils has the potential to tap large hydrokinetic (tidal and riverine) energy resources and provide renewable and sustainable energy to water-front communities. Oscillating foils are less harmful to marine flora and fauna, can operate in many more locations and at lower water speeds than is possible for conventional rotary hydrokinetic turbines. Oscillating foils can also be placed in close proximity to each other, increasing the power density - the total power that can be extracted from a given area.  However, optimizing this placement depends on improved understanding of the interactions between adjacent hydrofoils, and in particular, the way in which structured wakes form, advect downstream and impact the performance of a neighboring hydrofoil.  This research project will address these issues, and lead to the development of predictive tools that can aid in the development of commercially feasible hydrokinetic energy systems, 

Using a tightly-integrated combination of experimental and computational approaches, a systematic framework will be developed for systematically characterizing and controlling the wake interactions between oscillating foils. The primary goal is to categorize vortex topology & convective paths based on the kinematics of the flapping motion.  These tools will be developed with aid of machine learning classification and regression models. Once the wake structure is well-predicted, control algorithms will be developed, and the vortex-foil interactions will be characterized in terms of beneficial and detrimental interactions for the purpose of energy harvesting. Simulations of single and multiple hydrofoils will be performed using a combination of two-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS) and three-dimensional Large Eddy Simulations (LES).  A computer-controlled three-hydrofoil system each equipped with force and torque sensors will be used in a large open surface water flume in conjunction with unsteady wake velocity surveys using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV).

"Humans have unique upright body posture and related anatomy, but paleontologists are not certain when these features first appeared in the hominin lineage. The aim of this doctoral research project is to functionally describe the anatomy of the primate neck to understand how differences in the neck are related to head posture, body posture, and locomotion in primates. The project will provide data that may be used for inferring when a human-like neck first appeared and how this anatomical change was associated with environmental, behavioral and biological factors. This study will employ a combination of 3D anatomical methods including CT scanning, digital muscle fascicle tracking, and biomechanical modeling, which will serve as training tools for future researchers and health care professionals. The 3D models generated in this study will be used in K-12 science education and outreach events for discussing human anatomy and primate conservation.

The objective of this study is to both characterize and quantify neck muscle anatomy in primates with different habitual body postures and locomotor behaviors. Using a biomechanical framework, the project will compare functional differences in neck musculature that are key for behaviors such as holding up the head and movement of the arms during suspension. Novel techniques including contrast-enhanced computed tomography, muscle fascicle tracking software, and 3D lever mechanics will be used to develop biomechanical models of how variation in muscle size, shape, and distribution is related to postural and locomotor behavior across primates. These biomechanical models will be applied to fossil hominins (Australopithecus sediba and Homo neanderthalensis) to interpret their neck anatomy and posture to more accurately understand and reconstruct their behaviors.

"Identifying how environmental factors affect where particular species occur is important for the preservation and maintenance of biodiversity. Specifically, this knowledge can be used to delineate species' ecological niches, provide benchmarks for measuring change, and help prioritize areas for conservation. Given this importance, ecologists have developed many statistical tools for identifying linkages between environmental factors and species occurrence patterns. Most of these tools can be sorted into two categories, based on whether they use traditional survey data, or animal tracking data.  In either category, the amount and quality of available data is frequently limiting. This project aims to unify these two approaches under a single methodology that can simultaneously use both types of data. This is important because it can help overcome limitations in each data source, and because these different data types have complementary strengths, and are thus more informative in combination. Project work will focus on at-risk species including jaguars and lowland tapirs, where both data types are available, to demonstrate how these techniques can inform conservation efforts. By combining the strengths of multiple data sources, these new methods will be able to better resolve priority habitats and areas for these vulnerable species. Senior project personnel will participate in the AniMove.org animal movement analysis courses to teach students to apply these methods to conservation problems and will also host a data-integration workshop at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Science (NCMNS). Leveraging the >1 million yearly visitors that NCMNS receives, this project?s outreach efforts will focus on creating and displaying immersive videos that bring to life the entire scientific process, ranging from study design and field work, through analysis and forecasting, and on to informed conservation decision making.

Tools that identify linkages between environmental drivers and species' occurrence patterns are routinely used in ecology, with species distribution models (SDMs) and resource selection functions (RSFs) being especially prominent examples. Though these approaches are closely related, SDMs tend to be employed on large scales with survey data, while RSFs are typically used for local populations and applied to animal tracking data. The ubiquitous auto-correlation within, and frequent cross-correlation among, individual tracking datasets violates the key independence assumption of standard distribution models. To unify these approaches, a novel weighted log-likelihood function will be developed to account for non-independence both within and among tracking datasets, as well as for differing sampling schedules and study duration. This weighted log -likelihood will be integrated with both presence-only and presence-absence survey data in the very general in homogeneous Poisson point process framework for distribution modeling. This approach has two primary advantages. First, it would allow accumulating stockpiles of tracking data to validly inform a broad range of distribution analyses, from RSFs at the local scale, to SDMs at the geographic range scale. Second, it will counteract the often -pronounced spatial biases in survey data by leveraging the fact that tracked animals frequently go where surveyors don? t. Compared to conventional distribution models, this novel methodology will scale seamlessly from local populations to geographic ranges, increase overall sample size, and exploit the contrasting properties of the different data types to reduce spatial bias and more accurately estimate uncertainty. To facilitate broad use of this methodology, a freely available software tool, the Distribution Data Integration Module (DDIM), will be developed to both construct the necessary multi-source datasets, and annotate these data with relevant environmental covariates. Project results will be available at http://biology.umd.edu/movement.html.

"If life began on Earth when chemistry led to the molecular building blocks, which in turn self-assembled to form cells, then this prebiotic chemistry must have been a natural extension of the environmental conditions somewhere on the planet. Mid-range UV light (UVC) was one such robust environmental factor on the surface of early Earth. Were the legacy photoproperties of the molecular building blocks of today's life shaped by UVC fluxes and UVC photochemistry? How could we prove that? The PI will be able for the first time to answer unambiguously a long-standing central question in the origins of life field, regarding the role of UV light. The PI's experimental database - in particular, elucidating the mechanisms of RNA and DNA self-repair, will be invaluable to a much broader audience of scientists from basic biophysics to translational medicine. Students and postdoctoral researchers, including members of underrepresented groups in STEM, will receive training in technology and scientific applications at the intersection of chemistry, physics, and planetary science. The PI will communicate our findings to the general public.

The question of how prebiotic chemistry, on early Earth or other planetary bodies, led to the emergence of life remains wide open. In this project the PI will focus on resolving the mechanisms for non-enzymatic self-replication of RNA. This is the defining step in the transition from prebiotic synthetic chemistry to the self-assembly of evolving protocells for surficial origins of life scenarios based on RNA. The PI will purchase mid-infrared femtosecond transient absorption spectrophotometer, complemented by an FTIR spectrometer to characterize samples stationary before and after transient measurements. The IR spectrophotometer will be integrated into the PI's operational UV-VIS femtosecond pump-probe system with a tunable excitation range starting at 190 nm. The current UV-VIS system has allowed the PI to study the photodynamics of some monomers (e.g., nucleotides), the selectivity of their synthetic pathways, and related photoredox cycles. However, the important steps of oligomerization, and many of the precursors, like the imidazolium bridge in RNA self- replication, have viable spectroscopic signatures only in the IR.

"Mantas and devil rays are large fishes that feed by engulfing massive volumes of seawater, extracting plankton with a specialized filter structure, and expelling filtered water through the gill slits. These animals utilize a highly-efficient filtration mechanism, ricochet separation, that is distinct from previously-described biological or industrial filtration processes. This project will use a multidisciplinary approach to examine the fluid dynamics and filtration mechanics of this unique system. This project will characterize the anatomy of the filtering structure, identify how the shape of the structure affects the flow around the filter, and determine how the resulting flow patterns affect particle filtration. This work will provide critical insights into the physiology of an ecologically important and threatened group of animals. In addition, there is substantial need for improved filtering strategies for use in applications ranging from mitigating large-scale environmental contamination events to routine wastewater treatment. This project will elucidate the mechanics of a novel and highly-efficient filtration process, and has considerable potential to lead to advanced, bioinspired filtration systems. This research will also provide valuable training for undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral scientists and support activities to engage school-aged students and expose them to biomechanics and bioinspired engineering.


The filtering apparatus of mobulid fishes (mantas and devil rays) is a highly-specialized gill-raker structure. It has long been believed that the raker functioned as a sieve filter, simply trapping particles larger than the pore size. However, recent work has shown that the raker utilizes a unique filtration mechanism, ricochet separation, in which complex flow fields cause plankton particles to recoil off the filter surfaces and become concentrated within the buccal cavity. This filtration process has several favorable properties including that it efficiently separates particles smaller than the pore size, is highly resistant to clogging, and has low hydrodynamic resistance. This project will examine the fluid dynamic processes underlying this mechanism and the morphological factors that influence its performance. This research uses a multipronged approach that includes anatomical studies (micro computed tomography), experimental fluid mechanics (particle image velocimetry and filtration efficiency measurements), and theoretical modeling (computational fluid dynamics). Aim 1 will investigate the small-scale physical processes at the surface of the filter, identifying how individual plankton particles interact with the filter and how this interaction is affected by the morphology of the filter. Aim 2 will examine the large-scale flow patterns that develop in the mouth and will determine how this flow influences the filtration mechanics. Aim 3 will use an understanding of these processes to create and optimize bio-inspired engineered filtration systems.

"Non-Technical Abstract
Nano-structured cellulose or ""nanocellulose"" is readily produced through the breakdown of cellulose fibers, which are ubiquitous in our surroundings. One form of nanocellulose, namely, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), are high aspect ratio, highly crystalline materials, whose mechanical properties have made them attractive candidates for a wide range of applications including polymer composites and personal care products. The high aspect ratio of CNCs imparts them with the ability to self-assemble into liquid crystalline (LC) phases which provide opportunities for the development of new sensors and optical technologies.  This proposal explores the design and development of a class of functionalized CNCs, namely CNCs uniformly functionalized with earth abundant magnetic materials which will lead to the development of ferromagnetic alternatives. Low-cost, ferromagnetic materials based upon sustainable bio-derived materials could transform the world in which we live, creating opportunities for new optical devices that could be manipulated in the presence of magnetic fields, impacting technologies ranging from sensors to optical signaling and transmission. The proposed research provides opportunities for the integration of research and education in technologies of societal significance. In addition, students engaged in the program will be exposed to a multidisciplinary experience at the intersection of chemical engineering, materials science, materials chemistry and materials physics.  The student participants will be cross-trained and where necessary will further expand their knowledge and experience through relevant additional collaborations.

Technical Abstract
The propensity of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) to organize into liquid crystalline structures offers opportunities for the design of entirely new classes of sustainable materials that exhibit phenomena that may enable new classes of optical devices. Functional CNCs, in particular, offer opportunities for creating not only new classes of optical devices, but also magneto-optical devices. This project will explore the design of functionalized, intrinsically magnetic CNCs whose structure could be influenced by the presence of electrical and/or magnetic fields. It is proposed that a thin conformal layer of metals such as Ni, Cr, and Fe on the surface of the biomaterial will lead to creation of a cholesteric phase, which will provide a demonstration of an ordered fluid possessing spontaneous magnetization in the absence of an external magnetic field. Such a discovery will create entirely new research directions and opportunities for technology development. In an effort to understand and exploit the range of opportunities, ferromagnetic cholesteric liquid crystals will be created and the coupling between the magnetic moment and director of the chiral nematic phase will be investigated. In addition, the self-assembly of the functional CNCs in confined geometries, specifically spherical and cylindrical geometries will be interrogated. These studies will be combined with investigations into confinement of the liquid crystalline phase in thermoresponsive, spherical microgel particles. The proposed investigation will afford new, sustainable advanced optical technologies.

"Nontechnical: Chip-scale photonic devices can miniaturize a bulk optical system into a single tiny chip, making it portable and allowing various optical applications outside of the laboratory. The integration of photonic chips with electronic circuitry can also lead to a broad range of applications, for example, in high-speed optical communication, chemical- and bio-sensing, high-precision spectroscopy, and light detection and ranging for driverless automobiles. As electronic devices have been revolutionized in support of high-density integrated circuits, increasing the photonic chip integration density is highly desired in many optical applications; it offers more functionality and lower power consumption in a chip. However, due to the wave nature of light, high-density photonic chip integration is extremely difficult, and the current approach relies on the index-contrast of composite semiconductor materials. Research at Texas Tech University will explore an alternative approach of using all-dielectric and highly anisotropic metamaterials, i.e. artificially engineered man-made materials, to increase the photonic chip integration density. The proposed research will be implemented on a monolithic silicon-on-insulator wafer, which is compatible with the current semiconductor foundry process and provides a low-cost solution; thus, this research would have a broader impact in industry as well, accelerating the practical use of photonic chips in many applications. Educational and outreach activities are a high priority of this project and will provide hands-on experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, especially underrepresented groups of students.

Technical: Realizing a high-density photonic chip integration is highly desired in many applications, as more building blocks provide more functionalities on a single chip (analogous to electronics). However, current approaches of light confinement rely on the index-contrast of core and cladding materials and further miniaturization of photonic devices is hampered by the wave nature of light, i.e., the evanescent wave in the cladding causes waveguide crosstalk. The goal of this project is to suppress the waveguide crosstalk significantly and to devise and implement ultracompact on-chip photonic devices and circuitry. This project will pursue this goal through fundamental analysis and experimental demonstration of the exceptional coupling phenomena in the extreme skin-depth waveguides. An anisotropic coupling mechanism in the extreme skin-depth waveguides will be explored to fundamentally understand the phenomena and extremely long coupling lengths with low crosstalk will be experimentally demonstrated on a silicon chip. The fabrication tolerance of the exceptional coupling will be assessed as well, and all the characterization results will be compared with numerical and analytical results. The project will also explore the effect of active media in anisotropic claddings and will implement various passive and active ultracompact photonic devices with anisotropic metamaterials. The outcomes of this project will scientifically reveal the fundamental mechanism of an exceptional coupling that can suppress optical crosstalk and will technically advance photonic applications by providing more functionalities on a chip.

"Old World monkeys are found across Africa and Asia today with various physical and behavioral adaptations that allow them to survive and coexist in a range of habitats. Fossils from Africa show a similar pattern of Old World monkey diversity and coexistence in the past, although not all of these fossil species survived to the present. This doctoral dissertation project will examine how Old World monkey communities change in response to local environmental conditions and why some species within these communities are more successful than others. Dental features associated with dietary adaptations will be used to reconstruct the ecologies of living and fossil Old World monkeys and to compare across communities from different temporal and geographic settings. This will provide long-term context for understanding the present-day diversity of Old World monkey communities and for predicting potential responses of these communities to ongoing and future environmental change. This project will directly engage undergraduates in research, including students from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM. Photographs and measurement data will be made freely available online to other researchers; they will also be used to create written articles and educational materials shared with local schools and museums, and posted online for the general public on the AskAnAnthropologist.asu.edu website.

A range of climatic, ecological, biogeographical, and phylogenetic hypotheses have been proposed to explain how and why present-day primate communities contain certain combinations of species and adaptations. This project uses a broad temporal and geographic sample of Old World monkey communities in Africa and Asia today and in the African fossil record to systematically test hypotheses linking species diversity, adaptation, and extinction with local environmental phenomena. Dental metric data will be used to create a multivariate model of the Old World monkey ecomorphological niche, from which the researchers will calculate and compare community niche volumes, positions, and overlap. Model selection will then be used to evaluate the relative influence of climate factors, habitat structure, mammalian competition, and dispersal barriers in leading communities to have similar or distinct ecomorphological niches. As Old World monkeys are well-represented in the fossil and present-day communities, they provide an ideal model for understanding complex patterns of diversity and extinction in the past, present, and future.

"Recent field studies of flight mechanics in birds of several types and sizes have revealed more use of environmental energy (e.g. gusts, wakes and updrafts) to power flight than was previously believed to be the case. However, because the detailed studies of the aerodynamics, flight costs and flight mechanics of birds have been carried out in wind tunnels with smooth, steady air flow, little is known about how birds take advantage of unsteady flow patterns. In this project the researchers will fill this gap in understanding by measuring the energetic cost of flight, the aerodynamics, and the flapping motion of birds in a wind tunnel, comparing smooth flow conditions to 4 different unsteady flow cases. This study will also test the use of body-mounted accelerometers to serve as a proxy measure of the energetic cost of flight over the same wide range of flow conditions, enabling more accurate field studies. This research will add to basic understanding of aerodynamics in unsteady flows and the ecology and evolution of small birds. Pursuing this project requires an interdisciplinary combination of biology and engineering. To further the educational goals of this project, it includes a Research Experience for Undergraduates component. In this sub-program, Biology and Engineering undergraduates from around the nation apply for a summer research fellowship to work on the project. Selected students will assist with the main project and pursue a sub-project of their own design with the assistance of the rest of the project team.

In this project the PI and Co-PIs will apply state-of-the-art metabolic aerodynamic and accelerometry measurements to understand the energetic costs or benefits for interactions between birds and potentially beneficial flow structures, along with the underlying aerodynamic mechanisms that give rise to the metabolic outcomes. Flow patterns will be generated using an actuated airfoil capable of producing organized non-steady flows with independently variable frequency, magnitude and direction, allowing us to precisely delineate potentially beneficial environmental flows. Accelerometry results will be compared to aerodynamic and metabolic results to investigate the feasibility of using accelerometry as a proxy for energy expenditure in flight across a wide range of flight speeds and airflow patterns. Broader impacts from this study focus on a Research Experience for Undergraduates program whereby nationally recruited Biology and Engineering or Physics undergraduates will be trained in interdisciplinary research and collaboration while they assist with the main project goals and, in consultation with the rest of the team, design and execute their own sub-project.

To further the educational goals of this project, it includes a Research Experience for Undergraduates component. In this sub-program, Biology and Engineering undergraduates from around the nation apply for a summer research fellowship to work on the project. Selected students will assist with the main project and pursue a sub-project of their own design with the assistance of the rest of the project team.

In this project the PI and Co-PIs will apply state-of-the-art metabolic aerodynamic and accelerometry measurements to understand the energetic costs or benefits for interactions between birds and potentially beneficial flow structures, along with the underlying aerodynamic mechanisms that give rise to the metabolic outcomes. Flow patterns will be generated using an actuated airfoil capable of producing organized non-steady flows with independently variable frequency, magnitude and direction, allowing us to precisely delineate potentially beneficial environmental flows. Accelerometry results will be compared to aerodynamic and metabolic results to investigate the feasibility of using accelerometry as a proxy for energy expenditure in flight across a wide range of flight speeds and airflow patterns. Broader impacts from this study focus on a Research Experience for Undergraduates program whereby nationally recruited Biology and Engineering or Physics undergraduates will be trained in interdisciplinary research and collaboration while they assist with the main project goals and, in consultation with the rest of the team, design and execute their own sub-project.

"Recent field studies of flight mechanics in birds of several types and sizes have revealed more use of environmental energy (e.g. gusts, wakes and updrafts) to power flight than was previously believed to be the case. However, because the detailed studies of the aerodynamics, flight costs and flight mechanics of birds have been carried out in wind tunnels with smooth, steady air flow, little is known about how birds take advantage of unsteady flow patterns. In this project the researchers will fill this gap in understanding by measuring the energetic cost of flight, the aerodynamics, and the flapping motion of birds in a wind tunnel, comparing smooth flow conditions to 4 different unsteady flow cases. This study will also test the use of body-mounted accelerometers to serve as a proxy measure of the energetic cost of flight over the same wide range of flow conditions, enabling more accurate field studies. This research will add to basic understanding of aerodynamics in unsteady flows and the ecology and evolution of small birds.

"The research objectives of this project at the University of Colorado, University of Cambridge in the UK and USDA-ARS are to measure the state of the soil accurately, densely and remotely using plants as in situ chemical laboratories. Correlations between the state of the soil and the contents of the major water-conducting tissue in plants, the xylem, are well-established. Xylem contents will be analyzed in ""interrogator plants"" by implanting bioelectronic sensors in plant stems, inducing xylem to form around them and remotely communicating data from these sensors by low-power radio transmission.  This approach will avoid the complexity of sensing the soil directly by instead detecting the chemical response of vascular fluids to chemical and biological changes in the soil around the roots. These fluids, which are transported by the woody xylem tissues, are under negative pressure and thus typically difficult to access.  The project will therefore investigate a number of regeneration techniques for surgically implanted, small sensors such that these sensors become associated with xylem tissue in graft junctions, much like the grafting currently used routinely in fruit trees.  The entire small sensor including implanted electronics and regenerative coating will be screen-printed for very low cost.  Screen printing recipes and other enabling techniques will be shared with the public through the Open Science Framework.  Public use of these results will be further fostered by funded kits distributed to teams through the international BioMaker and OpenPlant programs.

The research will explore the new field of phytoelectronics, the convergence of botany for biorecognition, bioelectronics for chemo-sensing, internet-of-things (IoT) electronics for communication, and machine-learning for classification.  The goals of the research are to 1) create an inexpensive, potentially biodegradable platform for multi-variate sensing of the soil utilizing the inherent robustness of living plants to operate autonomously in variable conditions; 2) merge these plants with the IoT in which buried roots extract and communicate soil state chemically to embedded multi-analyte, electronic sensors that then digitize and relay these data to servers for integration and machine learning; and 3) advance understanding of the interaction of soil and the biosphere by selecting plants specialized for specific chemical, pathogen or ecological signals and using them as instruments.  The team will accomplish these goals by 1) printing the multi-analyte sensors based on arrays of organic electrochemical transistors individually functionalized with ion specific membranes, 2) creating printable drug-release coatings for the electronics that encourage regeneration of xylem tissue near the surgically implanted sensor, and 3) connecting these ""chipped plants"" to RFID or LoRA backscatter communication tags which are interrogated remotely to retrieve digitized sensor response.  At program end, the combination of these studies should enable the soil nitrate concentration in a cornfield to be monitored daily with resolution down to square meters.

"This doctoral dissertation research will assess the impact of historical decision-making processes on the Biological Anthropology collections at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History (NMNH). In addition to being snapshots of once living populations, biological anthropology collections are valuable repositories of past anthropologists' collection management strategies. The legacies and decisions, like ones made by Ales Hrdlicka at the NMNH, changed how collections of human remains were formed, accessioned, and cared for in museums. Understanding how collections were treated in the past will help museums make informed decisions about destructive sampling requests, allow researchers to optimize study design, and help to establish museum care standards with modern scientific methods (e.g. DNA sequencing) in mind. This project will contribute to STEM education by providing training opportunities for undergraduates through the Smithsonian Fellowship Program and Co-PI Austin's dissertation research. Additionally, the public will be engaged at events like the ""Expert Is In"" talk series at the NMNH, presentations at the NMNH and department presentations at the University of Oklahoma.

To investigate the impact of changing collection care strategies on biological anthropology collections, this project will focus on biomolecular (DNA) preservation in dental calculus (calcified plaque). Dental calculus from anthropological collections has been used to address important questions concerning the health, diet, and population dynamics of past peoples. However, variation in dental calculus development and preservation across human populations is underexplored. By taking into consideration multiple lines of evidence (i.e. ancient DNA sequencing, skeletal and morphological data, and archival information) from temporally and geographically representative collections, this study will investigate 1) how environmental factors contribute to dental calculus formation and 2) how collection care decisions by past biological anthropologists have affected the long-term storage of collections. As a world-leading museum, the NMNH offers extraordinary collections with spatial and temporal depth to address these two objectives and will provide valuable information to other collections around the world.

"This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need in the College of Engineering at North Carolina A&T State University. An HBCU, NC A&T is the largest producer of African-American undergraduate engineers and fifth in the nation for the percentage of undergraduate women engineering graduates. Over its five-year duration, this project will fund four-year scholarships to 22 students who are pursuing one of nine undergraduate engineering programs in the College of Engineering. These include architectural, bio(medical), biological, civil, chemical, computer, electrical, industrial & systems, and mechanical engineering, and computer science.  The project will expand the current pipeline of students with a focus on rural areas. A structured process will develop innovation and leadership in students beginning in the early stages of their academic careers. Cohort-based creative learning experiences will connect to the nationally recognized Engineering Grand Challenges Scholars Program and leadership development. Authentic experiential learning will be promoted through mentoring and interdisciplinary experiences. The project will provide training in innovation and leadership and will encourage global and cross-cultural perspectives. It will also foster the development of social consciousness through service learning. An Engineering Leadership belt recognition system will be formalized and extended to impact a broad range of students at NC A&T and support other funded student development efforts. Coupled with the national trend in engineering colleges toward innovation and entrepreneurship, this project has the potential to develop leaders and broadly introduce a shared core leadership competency to students nationally. 

The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. This combination of innovation and leadership is expected to promote academic motivation and performance. It is also expected to stimulate entrepreneurship knowledge and interest in socially relevant solutions. This premise is rooted in published research regarding under-served populations as well as nationally changing student personas. An adaptable model termed ""Learn-Do-Lead"" will be structured and evaluated. The model will facilitate the execution of any student growth initiative, in our case innovation, within a consistent leadership development context.  The project will strive to identify the content and pedagogy that will most impact innovation and leadership. It also seeks to understand impact on student performance, motivation, and entrepreneurial knowledge, as well as assess institutional integration methods for sustainability. Results will be disseminated through professional conferences and engineering education professional journals, as well as workshops, seminars, and other training opportunities. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.

"While longevity is often described as a uniquely human trait, other apes like chimpanzees also have extended lifespans, living twice as long as monkeys or lemurs. However, we don't fully understand the effects of aging on apes in the wild or which aspects of human longevity are unique. This doctoral research project will investigate how wild male chimpanzees age physiologically and behaviorally with a focus on how aging impacts foraging ability, which may reveal how frailty impacts fitness. The findings will help clarify whether chimpanzees' feeding behavior and performance change with age, and whether foraging could play an important role in shaping their patterns of senescence. This research will fill gaps in our knowledge on the senescence of male primate skeletal biology and may help to clarify whether fertility maintained late in life contributes to the evolution of extended lifespan. The investigators will engage in educational activities in the United States and near the research site in rural Uganda, and foster international research collaborations and capacity building. In addition, the continued presence of researchers in Kibale National Park helps protect one of the last tropical rainforests in all of East Africa, which is notably one of the principal strongholds of chimpanzees in this area.

The proposed research will investigate aging in male chimpanzees living in an exceptionally large community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. The investigators will assess the physiological traits of adult male chimpanzees at various ages to assess how bone density, body mass, chewing ability, and energetic status may decrease in old age. To this end, the research will non-invasively collect and analyze fecal samples to assess chewing efficiency as well as urine samples to measure insulin biomarkers (an indicator of energetic status) and collagen biomarkers to investigate decreases in bone density. Behavioral observations will also be carried out to assess how these physical changes may impact movement, food selection, ingestion rates, mating effort, and sociality. Through a systematic study of aging male chimpanzees' physiology and behavior, this research aims to elucidate the processes of aging and its impact on fitness in wild animals.

"Within any population, some individuals perform better than others. These individuals may survive longer or produce more offspring. Weddell seals in Erebus Bay, Antarctica, provide an unparalleled opportunity to investigate how an animal's physiology, behavior, and genetic make-up contribute to lifetime reproductive success because they have been the subject of a long-term population monitoring study and are easily accessible during their reproductive season. This project will distinguish key differences in energy allocation, reproductive timing, and dive capacities between female Weddell seals with a history of frequently producing pups (""high-quality"" group), versus females that have produced pups only infrequently (""low-quality"" group). For each group of females, physiology and behavior during the nursing period will be analyzed to assess whether investments influence their probability of reproducing the following year. Whole genomes will be compared between groups to identify underlying genes that govern reproductive success and population stability in a long-lived mammal. This collaborative project will provide research opportunities and training to several undergraduate and graduate students at the three participating institutions. Results will be broadly disseminated through presentations and peer-reviewed publications, and to students via an extensive public outreach collaboration with museum programming, curriculum-aligned science lessons, and pedagogy training.

Within any wild animal population there is substantial heterogeneity in reproductive rates and animal fitness. Not all individuals contribute to the population equally; some are able to produce more offspring than others and thus are considered to be of higher quality. This study aims to distinguish which physiological mechanisms (energy dynamics, aerobic capacity, and fertility) and underlying genetic factors make some Weddell seal females particularly successful at producing pups year after year, while others produce far fewer pups than the population average. In this project, an Organismal Energetics approach will identify key differences between high- and low-quality females in how they balance current and future reproductive success by tracking lactation costs, midsummer foraging success and pregnancy rates, and overwinter foraging patterns and live births the next year. Repeated sampling of individuals' physiological status (body composition, endocrinology, ovulation and pregnancy timing), will be paired with a whole-genome sequencing study. The second component of this study uses a Genome to Phenome approach to better understand how genetic differences between high- and low-quality females directly correspond to functional differences in transcription, translation, and ultimately phenotype. This component will contribute to the functional analysis and annotation of the Weddell seal genome. In combination, this project will make strides towards distinguishing the roles that plastic (physiological, behavioral) and fixed (genetic) factors play in complex, multifaceted traits such as fitness in a long-lived wild mammal.

"Enzymes are specialized proteins that catalyze chemical reactions in biological systems. Changes in temperature, pressure, or composition of the environment surrounding the protein, among many other factors, can have significant effects on enzyme catalyzed reactions. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. G. Andres Cisneros from the University of North Texas and Dr. Pengyu Ren from the University of Texas at Austin to develop computational methods and software to accurately predict the effects that charges in the surrounding solvent have on enzymatic catalysis. Detailed understandings for how enzymes function in highly charged solvents (ionic liquids) potentially lead to the development of new bio-inspired catalysts for biotechnology and bioengineering applications. The state-of-the-art computational methods from this project are used to investigate the reaction mechanisms of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in different charged solutions. Peroxidases are important enzymes that help prevent oxidative damage in aerobic organisms. The newly developed methods and source codes for programs are made freely available, which impact the ability of the scientific community to predict the behavior of enzymes in a variety of environments. In addition, the project engages school students and teachers from underrepresented minority groups in the sciences through various outreach and mentoring programs at the two participating institutions.

The main premise of this project is that differences in temperatures at which homologous enzymes show maximum activity arise from differences in the balance between enthalpic and entropic contributions to the free energies of activation, even when these free energies are similar. This difference in enthalpic-entropic balance is due to differences in flexibility of surface residues. Alternatively, effects on the flexibility of surface residues from interactions with the solvent may exert long range-electrostatic effects on the active sites. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to apply quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations to investigate the effect of highly charged ionic liquid (IL) solutions on the enthalpic-entropic balance for enzymatic catalysis. This project continues the development of the AMOEBA-IL (atomic multipole optimized energetics for biomolecular applications in ionic liquids) force field and implements enhanced sampling methods in the QM/MM code of the LICHEM (Layered Interacting Chemical Models) package and its interface to TINKER-OpenMM molecular mechanics/dynamics sortware package. These tools are used to computationally model the reaction mechanism of horseradish peroxidase in different IL solutions. Arrhenius plots calculated for the various IL solution systems determine the enthalpic-entropic balance for each tested system to ascertain the effect of the different solvent environments on the reaction pathway. Results from this work provide fundamental insights into the role of solvents on enzyme catalysis and the role/impact of surface-residue flexibility on enzymatic reaction mechanisms. Additionally, this project develops new methods and parameters for AMOEBA, and these are made available to the broad scientific community.

"Experimental methods for interleaving layers of 2D materials have been developed with endless possibilities for creating stable structures with desired electronic, optical, magnetic and thermal properties. This project will develop mathematical models and computational methods to guide the search and design of 2D materials with optimal properties. This approach makes possible the long-sought goal of atomic-level control of nanostructures as building blocks for creating devices of desirable properties and performance characteristics. The mathematical modeling, analysis, and computation from the atomic to macroscopic scale developed by the project will contribute to the design of new materials leading to applications in incommensurate 2D materials. This effort will impact the development of materials and devices with desired characteristics and performance for a wide range of applications of interest including ultra-fast electronic, opto-electronic, and magnetic devices; nonconventional optical and photonics devices; and communication devices. The challenge of modeling layered incommensurate heterostructures will also promote the development of multiscale models for many other aperiodic materials systems such as composites, atomically engineered structures, and bio-materials. 2D materials research is an ideal platform to motivate new mathematics training and curricula in the analysis, modeling, and computation of quantum electronic structure and transport, and mechanical and topological properties of materials. The project's graduate student training and outreach to underrepresented student populations will broaden the diversity of the mathematical research community.

The main issue encountered in the mathematical modeling of layered 2D materials is that the lattice periodicities of different layers do not match and thus lead to incommensurate structures. New theory and computational methods that do not use Bloch-Fourier methods will be developed to accurately predict material properties in currently inaccessible regimes. This project will utilize the notions of local configuration space and locality to give new formulations and computational methods for the electronic density of states and for transport properties such as conductivity. New momentum space formulations and corresponding fast computational methods will be developed that exploit the structure of the momentum space Hamiltonian. Novel models and computational methods will also be developed and analyzed that extend our model for electronic density of states and conductivity to include mechanical relaxation.

"Extreme environments allow for the investigation of life's capacity and limitations to cope with far-from-average environmental conditions. Springs rich in hydrogen sulfide represent some of the most extreme freshwater environments because hydrogen sulfide halts energy production in animal cells. Nonetheless, some fish have colonized sulfide springs throughout the Americas and have evolved into new species in the process. This project will investigate how the genetic changes that mediate the fish's ability to tolerate hydrogen sulfide impact their ability to successfully interbreed with related fish that live in adjacent freshwater streams. It involves the identification of genetic differences between hydrogen sulfide-tolerant and susceptible populations, particularly in genes associated with pathways affected by hydrogen sulfide toxicity. In addition, it will be tested how hybrids between tolerant and susceptible populations differ from their parents. Specifically, the function of mitochondria and whole organisms will be compared between parents and hybrids in presence or absence of hydrogen sulfide. This project will yield new insights into how adaptation to environmental stress leads to genetic incompatibilities that represent barriers for interbreeding between populations, and thus, into how new species form. This project provides training opportunities in integrative biology for participants at all levels of higher education. It will also contribute to science education and public outreach by training scientists to become effective science communicators and reach non-expert audiences in collaboration with informal education institutions. 

Natural selection drives adaptive evolution and can cause speciation. However, the potential role of intrinsic genetic incompatibilities during speciation with gene flow remains largely unknown. Investigating speciation with gene flow in the context of physiological adaptation allows closing existing gaps of knowledge. This is possible through integrated analyses of how selection shapes genomic divergence, how recombination of divergent genomes in hybrids affects physiological function, and how these functional consequences affect the speciation process. This project tests a priori predictions about the links between physiological adaptation to toxic hydrogen sulfide and the emergence of reproductive isolation. It will focus on components of a highly conserved metabolic pathway, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which plays a central role in adaptation to hydrogen sulfide. Because OXPHOS components are encoded by both the mitochondrial and the nuclear genomes, theory predicts that adaptive modification of OXPHOS should give rise to mitonuclear incompatibilities and contribute to the speciation process. This project investigates the mechanistic links between physiological adaptation and speciation by testing a priori predictions about (1) how OXPHOS adaptation affects genomic divergence between populations living in different environments, (2) the functional consequences of mitonuclear incompatibilities at the biochemical, physiological, and organismal levels, and (3) the relative role of mitonuclear incompatibilities during speciation. The project employs an integrative approach that combines population genomics, assays of enzyme, organelle, and whole organism function, as well as field and laboratory experiments for the quantification of multiple pre- and postzygotic mechanisms of reproductive isolation.

"In some species, including many reptiles, birds, and fish, whether an animal becomes male or female depends on temperatures they are exposed to during early life. These species are likely to be affected by environmental changes, producing too many males or too many females when temperatures increase. How that might lead to increases or decreases in population abundance is not well understood. For example, a lack of males may not be a problem if a few males can mate with many females. Focusing on a population of the green sea turtle, the research will advance the fundamental knowledge of how the mating behaviors of these species can buffer against environmental change. This will be done using field surveys of male and female turtles and their nests, genetic measurements of parentage, and mathematical models of population change. The results will advance our understanding of how altered numbers of males and females affect the long-term population persistence of such species and their capacity to acclimate or adapt to skewed numbers of males or females. This will substantially improve frameworks to assess the impacts of environmental change on this type of species, improving management and conservation outcomes. This is important because sea turtles are some of the species most vulnerable to the impacts of environmental change. Other broader impacts of this research include training of early career researchers from underrepresented groups, public outreach, and dissemination of results in collaboration with a turtle conservation organization.

Species in which the environment determines whether they become male or female are predicted to produce too many males or too many females with environmental change. This will ultimately affect long-term population viability and limit reproductive output. Despite the fundamental importance of understanding whether these species are resilient to environmental change, knowledge of the response of their mating systems and population dynamics to producing skewed numbers of males or female remains limited. This research will advance the understanding of how altered production of males or females affect the long-term population persistence of these species by combining multiple methods, using the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) population that nests in Brazil as a model. Field observations and genetic parentage analysis will quantify multiple aspects of the green sea turtle mating system (i.e., ratio of males to females that are ready to mate at any one time, ratio of the number of unique males and females that produce viable offspring, male natal philopatry, and breeding intervals) and linking these to reproductive success (egg numbers). These data will be used in an eco-evolutionary dynamic population model to assess persistence and the potential for adaptation. This research will take advantage of recent technological advancements in wildlife genetics, bio-logging devices, unmanned aerial vehicles, evolutionary modeling, and environmental forecasting. The outcome will be the first comprehensive examination of the potential for the mating system of species in which the environment determines whether they become male or female to provide resilience to environmental change.

"Irregular amounts of specific molecules of micro-RNA (miRNA) in serum or plasma are promising biomarkers for many chronic diseases, particularly cancers. Different types of miRNAs have been found to be over-expressed for different cancers. The goal of this research is to develop optical fiber-based biosensors for point-of-care (POC) measurement of miRNA molecular biomarkers for a wide of range of bio-sensing applications. This research will leverage the team's previously developed pretreatment technologies for miRNA extraction from whole blood. To achieve POC early cancer screening, these pretreatment technologies will be integrated with the proposed sensor to achieve extremely high sensitivity of detection. In this sensor, specific probes attached to nanoparticles will be used to increase sensitivity. An integrated prototype for measuring multiple miRNAs will be delivered at end of this project, and this will be further developed to detect much larger libraries of miRNAs biomarkers in the future.

The nanocone array is based on and fabricated with several intriguing and poorly understood physical phenomena at conic/wedge geometries. Like plasmonic resonance at metallic tips and scattering at dielectric wedges/cones, evanescent wave mode at a conic tip can produce a localized hotspot with high optical intensity. This tip evanescent mode is coupled to specific optical fiber wave-guide modes that undergoes multiple internal reflections. The resonant core-shell nanoparticles, which allows further plasmonic resonant enhancement, are immobilized around the tip by a unique laser bubble contact line deposition technique. The extreme curvature of the conic substrate controls the size of the laser-nucleated bubble on the cone tip and the subsequent contact-line receding rate. The deposition of the nanoparticle in the bulk solution to the wedge-like moving contact line is also controlled by singular heating and Marangoni effects at the wedge-like contact line. All these phenomena driven by the infinite curvatures of cones and wedges will be carefully studied combining computation and experiments. Within this proposed project, the team will design such a nanoarray for a promising set of cancer biomarkers, mi-RNAs, whose individual copy number ranges from 10^2 to 10^6 in a small-volume patient blood sample (~10 microliter). Leveraging their past experience and industrial connections, the PIs will seek commercialization opportunities for the proposed sensing platform. This project will also provide research opportunities to students from under-represented undergraduate groups, local community college and high school.

"It is often crucial to control friction of soft material surfaces.  For example, high sliding friction between rubber tires and the road surface enables quick braking. In the biological context, it is sometimes desirable to minimize friction, as between a contact lens and the eye.  On other occasions high friction is needed, for example when designing hands of a soft robot for grasping objects.  This Leading Engineering for America's Prosperity, Health, and Infrastructure (LEAP-HI) Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison (GOALI) project will develop two novel mechanisms to improve friction of soft materials based on bio-inspired design of near-surface structures.  The research will be carried out by a research team with members from Lehigh and Cornell Universities, and Michelin USA, with application to tires.  Tire production is a major component of the US industrial profile. Dozens of plants produce over 150 million car, truck, bus and other tires per year.  This research will support innovation that is needed to both increase vehicle safety and help the USA to maintain its position as a leading tire manufacturer.  

Friction as an interfacial property is usually understood to be governed by interfacial intermolecular interactions, coupled to bulk deformation and energy dissipation at macroscopic length scales, for example by viscoelasticity.  Recent work on bioinspired and biomimetic materials has shown how appropriately designed near-surface structures at a meso-scale (microns) intermediate between the molecular (nm) and continuum scales (mm and larger) can be used to strongly modulate surface properties like adhesion.  This has opened up a new paradigm and mechanisms for design of soft material interfaces, which however has been little exploited for control of friction.  Some of these mechanisms are meso-scale versions of molecular level phenomena that underlie the fundamental question of how friction arises between surfaces in the first place.  The goal of this project is to study and develop two meso-scale mechanisms underlying frictional energy loss, a) Meso-Scale Dislocation Arrays: in which the interface comprises a periodic array of features that accommodate misorientation by generating meso-scale interfacial dislocations, which can be used to control friction, and b) Elastic Hysteresis: in which periodic near-surface patterning of elastic modulus can be used to set up a periodic resisting force that, in turn, sets up mechanical instabilities and hysteresis to yield large friction enhancement.

"Metal additive manufacturing (AM) technologies rely on high-energy laser sintering of powder feedstock to fabricate high-strength, complex shaped, metal components for the aerospace, defense and medical industries. Laser enabled AM requires large amounts of energy to generate sufficiently high temperatures (500-1500 C) to sinter the feedstock, thus making it a notably slow process sometimes needing days to print 0.3 cubic meters of material. Recent studies on metal nanomaterials revealed they have unique properties that include reduced sintering temperatures (200-750 C), and enhanced heat generation resulting from laser light-matter interaction at the nano-scale. In this project, the laser interaction with a new class of AM-compatible nanostructured metal powder feedstock will be investigated. Attention will be given to tailoring the new feedstock so as to reduce the thermal energy and processing time requirements for sintering. If successful, this approach could eliminate the need for high-energy laser sources in additive metal processes, bringing capital and operational costs down, improving safety and expanding its industrial application. Further, realizing low-temperature sinterable metal feedstock is a step towards generating viable polymer-metal interfaces via additive processes; currently this is challenging as the polymer can undergo thermal degradation at current metal sintering temperatures (>500 C). Metal-polymer co-processing would allow academics and the medical industry to print bio-inspired knee-implants mimicking not only human hard tissues (e.g. bone) but also soft ones (e.g. ligaments). In addition to the technical aspects, this project supports a summer graduate student traineeship, and a high-school competition in additive manufacturing; both activities aim to attract and train the next-generation of manufacturing engineers and scientists required for future US workforce needs.

Nanoporous metal powders, e.g. with ligament size smaller than 50 nm, can be generated via dealloying methods. As their surface topography differs from solid particles generated via gas atomization they interact differently with incident laser beams. This project seeks to understand both the synthesis and laser sintering of nanoporous metal powder. Research focused on the synthesis of mesoporous metal powders will determine the physics and limitations of pore formation and control via chemical dealloying. The interaction of these novel particles with the laser source will be studied to elucidate how localized surface plasmon resonance within the ligaments of the pores can promote light-matter interaction during the sintering process, and how size-dependent melt-point suppression reduces the laser energy density and dwell requirements for processing. Research tasks include: 1) an investigation of the process-structure mapping of dealloying of metal alloys to quantify the role of adatom clustering in the pore formation theory, 2) experimental work to understand the scaling laws of mesoporous metal joining, 3) characterization of the stages of microstructural morphology evolution upon laser exposure such as pore coarsening, and 4) mechanical characterization of 3D printed specimens to elucidate the fundamental limit on the interfacial strength of low-temperature welded metal-metal and metal-polymer parts. If successful, this fundamental knowledge can be leveraged to improve the speed of metal AM and increase its combability with thermoplastics for simultaneous printing of polymers and metals.

"Plastics derived from petroleum-based polymers offer affordable packaging, adhesives, building materials, computer components, and sporting and safety equipment. The durability and stability of these materials, however, has resulted in an undesirable accumulation of discarded plastics in our environment. The NSF Center for Sustainable Polymers (CSP) addresses this challenge by designing functional and environmentally sustainable plastics. Key aspects of sustainability include making plastics from renewable resources, using green and sustainable reaction chemistries, and making specialty plastics that can be composted or recycled after their use. CSP seeks detailed understanding of the chemical transformations happening in all of these processes, building a body of knowledge that can be generalized to other systems. The multi-institutional and collaborative team involves researchers from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Cornell University, Northwestern University, Washington University in St. Louis, University of California Berkeley, University of Chicago and University of South Dakota. CSP promotes innovation through technology transfer and entrepreneurship as demonstrated by their patent portfolio and spin-off companies. CSP has extensive programs in education, outreach, and broadening participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences. Their efforts include developing new college curricula and laboratory experiments with sustainable polymer examples. CSP-supported graduate students and postdoctoral researchers access professional development opportunities in communication skills, creating collaborative and equitable work environments, project management, and engaging with industry researchers. A diverse group of undergraduates is supported through summer research opportunities. A national partnership is bringing science skills and discussions of sustainable plastics to 4-H groups across the country. 

The NSF Center for Sustainable Polymers (CSP) incorporates experts in all stages of polymer chemistry that range from developing polymers from renewable resources, creating new chemistries for synthesis, and improving the recycling or degradation pathways for plastics after use. CSP's research efforts are organized into three areas that have substantive scientific overlap: 1) to discover new, efficient, and often catalytic chemical transformations of biomass and other natural product-based feedstocks into both new and established polymer ingredients; 2) to discover new sustainable polymers with precisely controlled molecular structures and establish relationships between structure, morphology, and performance properties; and 3) to discover sustainable polymers with triggered degradation, chemical recycling, and compatibilization capabilities to reduce or eliminate plastic waste. Center members emphasize research translation and the protection of intellectual property in their innovation efforts. The center trains and develops a diverse cohort of chemists that works collaboratively and leverages one another's expertise. CSP partners with youth development organizations to encourage interest in the physical sciences and engages the public in the challenges and the opportunities presented by sustainable polymers. CSP works to advance data sharing and reuse by making original, primary data files available with all publications.

"Professors Ivan J. Dmochowski and Jeffery G. Saven of the University of Pennsylvania are supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry to elucidate how hollow and cage-like proteins can form nano-containers to encapsulate nanoparticles and other proteins such as enzymes.  Experimental approaches and theoretical methods are combined to understand these molecular systems and to engineer molecular containers for specific cargos and applications.  An important aim of the project is to develop chemistries and methods to link single containers together to form three-dimensional microarray structures.  The goal is to engineer microarrays for specific applications in catalysis, and to integrate judicially designed microarrays in functional devices, such as biosensors and enzyme cargo delivery systems.  Cage-like ferritin proteins provide a unique model system for studying bio-nano supramolecular assembly, and the modular ""molecular capsule-to-array"" concept provides a versatile platform for addressing many materials chemistry challenges in nanotechnology and biotechnology. Ordered hierarchical assembly of small nanostructures into larger, well-structured arrays can deliver desirable materials properties, self-assembly, and processability. Graduate and undergraduate students, including students from the University of Puerto Rico, are receiving multidisciplinary training through this collaborative research.  In addition, laboratory and classroom activities targeting middle, and high school students are being developed.  These activities are subjected to evaluation and best practices are prepared for publication in chemical education journals.

Ferritin proteins encapsulate appropriately sized and liganded inorganic nanoparticles or super-positively-charged proteins in native-like assemblies.  The research team aims to elucidate how cage-like proteins, such as thermophilic ferritin from A. fulgidus (AfFtn), encapsulate various nonbiological and biological cargo to form stable, molecularly precise nano-containers.  Computational protein design identifies amino acid mutations that enhance the stability of ferritin capsules. Design and modeling are also applied to guest species, such as super-positively-charged enzymes, to explore determinants of efficient ferritin encapsulation. Molecular simulations provide insight on the structure and dynamics of ferritin-nanoparticle and ferritin-protein interactions. Guided by computational design, an expanded set of inorganic nanoparticles and enzyme cargos are being identified and assessed. Experimental approaches range from the creation and processing of recombinant proteins to the biophysical characterization of ferritin assembly and encapsulation in solution and in the solid-state. An important goal is to link AfFtn capsules at engineered and structurally well-determined attachment sites to form well-defined arrays. Among several strategies to be pursued is the incorporation of divalent cation binding sites at the three-fold symmetric ferritin pores and subsequent formation of arrays with bis-hydroxamate linkers.

"Quantum effects are largely neglected in the description of living organisms, despite their importance in a wide variety of biological processes. Hydrogen bonds are best recognized as interactions that help fold DNA, RNA, and proteins into their functional shapes. Hydrogen bonds that bring atoms together to very short distances show prominent quantum mechanical properties and are closely associated with biological functions that range from enzymatic catalysis to antibiotic resistance. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Lu Wang from Rutgers University to computationally elucidate the quantum nature and biological functions of short hydrogen bonds (SHBs) in proteins. This project utilizes first principles calculations and simulations (based on the concepts of atomic nuclei and electrons) to unravel the quantum fluctuations and biological roles of SHBs in proteins that signal changes in a cell or that catalyze chemical reactions. Results from these studies provide guiding principles to the design of novel proteins and bio-inspired materials with enhanced functions. This project also enables graduate and undergraduate students, particularly women and students from underrepresented minority groups, to learn advanced computational methods and to discover the essential roles of quantum effects in biological systems.

This research project examines how the interplay of chemical features and quantum effects determines the biological functions of SHBs. The structural and chemical factors that facilitate the formation of SHBs are uncovered by statistically analyzing the Protein Data Bank. The impact of electronic and nuclear quantum effects on the proton behavior, spectroscopic shifts and functional roles of SHBs are studied by first principles simulations, with particular emphasis on the biological processes of bacterial phototaxis and enzyme catalysis. Information from this study helps establish a structure-property relation that explains and predicts the functions of biological SHBs.

"Synthetic cell engineering has the potential to reveal insights into the fundamental chemical and physical processes that underlie the function of biological cells and organelles as well as advance the design of biologically-inspired devices and materials with applications ranging from medicine to biotechnology. Recently, it has become clear that the function of many proteins and lipids in biological cells depends on posttranslational modifications, covalent additions to the surface of proteins after their synthesis. A majority of these modifications are performed by the Golgi apparatus, a central membrane organelle in mammalian cells with a unique and dynamically changing structure. Yet neither the features of the Golgi that facilitate the synthesis of these highly complex chemical structures nor how those reactions are spatially and temporally controlled is fully understood. To better understand the regulatory mechanisms of the Golgi structure, this proposal will reconstitute chemical and physical features of the Golgi in an in vitro system. 

This proposal will develop new strategies to uncover how physical features of membranes influence an essential posttranslational modification, glycosylation. Specifically, it will recreate a model multi-step glycosylation modification of lipid carriers in vitro using both microfluidic and vesicle-based platforms and uncover the rules of membrane spatial and physical features required to recapitulate the posttranslational modification process. Successful completion of these studies will reveal design rules that will enable creation of other posttranslational modifications through re-organization of these reactions, including synthetic modifications. With these insights, it will be possible to extend these findings to influence the activity and function of modified proteins and lipids in order to impact biological processes. This project will bridge a variety of interdisciplinary techniques in membrane biophysics, membrane protein reconstitution, protein engineering, microfluidics, transport phenomena, and chemical kinetics necessary to realize the project goals. The knowledge developed here will benefit the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries and have potential biomanufacturing applications in the design of therapeutic compounds.

"The human body is colonized by trillions of microorganisms collectively known as the human microbiome. Research suggests that our microbiome may influence a wide range of physiological functions and health, from immune function to mood. However, there are still many unanswered questions about how these microbes interact with each other and how those interactions affect human biology. By studying large networks of microbial interactions and functions in industrialized and non-industrialized human communities, this doctoral dissertation research will examine the extent of ecological diversity in human gut microbiomes and how differences in lifestyle impact this diversity. The research team will provide hands-on workshops to participant communities to discuss how their participation helps to advance microbiome research. The project will also support student training and mentoring of individuals from unrepresented groups in STEM, supporting broader participation in a rapidly developing area of biological research.

Humans living a Western-industrialized lifestyle have markedly different microbiomes than those living a more traditional, non-industrial lifestyle, such as hunter-gatherers and rural farmers from developing countries. Earlier studies have determined that diet, antibiotic use, and contact between humans and other animals all have major impacts on microbiome diversity. In a number of these studies, the way in which microbial diversity was estimated did not necessarily account for the fact that microbiomes are complex ecologies. In this study, the researchers will investigate ecological dynamics and microbial interactions in microbiomes from humans and pigs on family farms in Oklahoma and compare them to humans and pigs from the African country of Burkina Faso. By comparing both humans and pigs in an industrialized country to a developing country, the researchers will document the effects of lifestyle on the human microbiome with a focus on human-animal interactions. By investigating the ecological dynamics of functional redundancy and resilience in gut microbiomes, the project will advance knowledge about complex microbial ecology.

"This award is funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemical Instrumentation (CRIF) programs.   Professor Gregory McManus from Florida Gulf Coast University and colleagues Arsalan Mirjafari, Gregory Boyce, Daniel Paull and Xiaofei Zhang are acquiring a single crystal X-ray diffractometer. A diffractometer is a powerful tool used to determine the detailed structures of crystalline chemical compounds. X-rays are passed through a crystal of interest and a diffraction pattern is produced. The pattern is analyzed to obtain the microscopic structure, that is, the distances and angles between atoms in the material.  This structural data provides insight on the properties and possible uses of materials.  The researchers are investigating materials that can be used to store gases, such as methane or hydrogen for fuel applications.  Another investigation focuses on electrode materials for energy storage devices such as the lithium ion battery.   The diffractometer supports a network of chemistry faculty committed to undergraduate research and education in south Florida including: Florida Gulf Coast University, Florida Southern University, New College of Florida, Ave Maria University, St. Thomas University and Barry University.  The instrument is used to train undergraduate students in research.  The instrument is also used in lecture and laboratory courses preparing students for the modern workforce.

The acquisition of a single crystal x-ray diffractometer at Florida Gulf Coast University is used to support a wide variety of research projects including the synthesis of metal-organic materials for gas adsorption applications and the development of low-melting ionic liquids with high crystallinity which can be used as solvents in organic synthesis and separations.  Metal-organic framework systems are being studied for possible development as lithium-ion battery electrode materials.  The diffractometer is used to investigate the structure of palladium catalysts for possible use in synthesizing bioactive natural products.  Serpentine, a silicate mineral with three different types of crystals called polymorphs, is under study as a material for mineral-carbon dioxide sequestration. The diffractometer is used in studies to identify which polymorph is present in various samples.

"This is funding to support a Doctoral Consortium (workshop) of approximately 10 promising graduate students (4 from the United States who will be supported by this award), along with a number of distinguished research faculty.  The event will take place in conjunction with the 2019 Designing Interactive Systems Conference (DIS2019), which will be held on June 23-28, 2019, in San Diego, California.  DIS is an annual international conference that brings together 200-300 researchers and corporate leaders, as well as students, to present and discuss the latest multidisciplinary work on the design and evaluation of next-generation interactive user interfaces, systems, and applications.  Topics of special interest to the conference include: methods, tools, and techniques for engaging people; researching, designing, and co-designing interactive systems; user experience; usability; engagement; empowerment; well-being; designing things that matter; diversity; participation; making; sensors and actuators; mobile devices; novel artifact design; hybrid materials and surfaces; bio-electric systems; multi touch and touchless interaction; social media; personal, community, and public displays; health informatics; children-computer interaction; sustainability; digital arts; and new media.  Approximately 100 papers will be presented; accepted papers will be published in the DIS Conference Proceedings as well as in the Association for Computing Machinery's Digital Library. The program will also include invited keynote speakers, demonstrations, a variety of workshops, and poster sessions.  The theme of this year's conference is ""Contesting Borders and Intersections.""  The goal of the DIS Doctoral Consortium, to be held as a full-day event on Tuesday, June 25, is to expand student attendance and training in this area.  The workshop will help develop and refine the work of doctoral candidates in the field, under scrutiny and support from peers and experts that they would not otherwise be able to access.  Graduate student development is key to building a sustainable and vibrant intellectual community, engaged with the most important topics and approaches of the field.  Graduate student participation in the consortium by itself broadens the field; the impact is multiplied by what they bring back to their institutions and (eventually) to their workplaces and the students that they train.  

The Doctoral Consortium is designed to give students exposure to their research community, and the opportunity to present their work and receive constructive feedback from peers and senior researchers in the field. The event, which will be held in parallel with the conference workshops, is designed to encourage PhD students to start building a professional support network of peers and mentors.  During the session, each student will make a short presentation, followed by an open discussion and feedback from their peers.  A senior researcher will be appointed as a mentor for each student and will be requested to lead the discussion, ask questions, and provide specific feedback.

"This research project addresses the study of a group of poorly understood microorganisms called syntrophic bacteria and their methanogenic archaea partners that play essential roles in the anaerobic recycling of all naturally occurring biomass.  They function as members of microbial communities that consume decaying plant and animal material and convert it back into the starting materials needed for photosynthesis by plants and algae. The syntrophic bacteria first break down and recycle small organic molecules such as fats, amino acids and small aromatic compounds. The resulting waste products (vinegar, water and hydrogen gas) are then used by a second group of microbes called methanogens to generate more water plus carbon dioxide and methane. Methane can be harvested and used as a renewable energy supply. Through this cooperation, both microbes obtain energy to survive and grow in environments where neither could alone. A combination of molecular and biochemical tools is used to study the previously undescribed metabolism in each microbe and to understand how they cooperate with one another to optimally recycle waste materials in nature.  The enzymes used in substrate conversion will be identified and characterized; and how cells accomplish the exchange of metabolites will be examined. The new knowledge will assist in modeling and predicting how carbon is recycled in different environments, as well as how these processes affect the normal maintenance of the earth's biosphere.  Furthermore, it will improve our ability to recycle unwanted waste materials into renewable energy supplies.  In outreach activities, web-based learning materials will be generated and used to enhance undergraduate microbiology instruction at both institutions. In addition, the PIs will perform outreach activities in several under-developed countries to facilitate the development of locally sustainable applications for waste treatment and energy production.

Syntrophic metabolism is essential in nearly all anaerobic ecosystems, yet very little is understood about the molecular, biochemical, or physiological events that drive the associated ecological transformations. Here, microbial communities composed of distinct species of bacteria and archaea operate in metabolic balance to drive global carbon cycling and ecosystem functioning. The PIs hypothesize that specialized biochemical and adaptive systems are used by the syntrophic partners to accomplish their community-driven metabolism. To examine this, the model Syntrophomonas wolfei/Methanosprillum hungatei co-culture system will be employed to elucidate basic principles governing formation and maintenance of the syntrophic partnership. A combination of high-throughput technologies, including genome-wide proteomic profiling and genetic two hybrid screens, will be employed to identify the metabolic and regulatory networks involved in fatty acid catabolism.  This will be followed by the biochemical characterization of key proteins needed for carbon oxidation and electron flow down to the formation of H2 and CO2 which is a thermodynamically difficult process. The molecular events required to establish and maintain a related but distinct co-culture partnership, that between S. wolfei and Methanobrevibacter ruminantium will also be examined. The resulting information will provide a foundation to model and predict related processes by other multispecies microbial communities.  The new knowledge will be used to develop innovative solutions for waste treatment and energy production and to engineer bio-methanation and microbial fuel systems to provide locally sustainable applications for wastewater treatment.

"Throughout Earth's history the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has been influenced by reactions with different types of rocks at the surface. The CO2 erodes rocks such as basalt which releases elements into rivers and eventually these elements combine with seawater to form new rocks.  The variations in atmospheric CO2 content contribute to variations in the climate over tens or hundreds of millions of years. There is good evidence that 700 million years ago the Earth experienced the longest and most extreme glaciation in our planet's history and ice reached all the way to the equator. Unfortunately, we do not know what caused this glaciation or what the climate was like before the glaciers. This project will investigate the lead-up to the glaciation by examining specific elements in ancient rocks deposited in oceans using new advanced analytical methods.  By looking at the chemical composition of rocks that formed in the ancient oceans prior to the glaciation, Earth scientists can trace the changing ocean chemistry and then infer the ancient atmospheric conditions leading up to this glaciation. These investigations will help to train future Earth scientists and provide researchers with opportunities to communicate Earth history and climate science from a novel angle to a variety of audiences. The results from these studies will provide Earth scientists unique insights into the chemical evolution of our planet and oceans during an incredibly fascinating time period.

The Neoproterozoic Era (1000-539 Ma) witnessed the assembly and fragmentation of the Rodinia supercontinent, huge swings in geochemical cycles, biological firsts and innovations as well as extreme glaciations known as Snowball Earth events. Recent advances in our understanding of the interplay between these Snowball Earth events and the evolution of complex life have focused on the timing and duration of the glaciations and of the evolutionary events. Despite these advances very little progress has been made in understanding the drivers of the Snowball glaciations. The geology of Svalbard, Norway is host to a thick succession of pristine, low-grade sedimentary rocks that chart the lead-up and aftermath of these global glaciations and represents a unique setting to test a variety of hypotheses related to the causation of the glaciations and their impact on bio/geochemical cycles. This award supports two early-career Assistant Professors, a post-doctoral associate and a Masters student to conduct a detailed geochemical, sedimentological and geochronologic study of these sedimentary units. In particular, this research will couple numerous radiogenic and stable isotope systems tied to a robust stratigraphic and geochronologic framework to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the Snowball Earth events and trace the chemical evolution of seawater prior to and immediately after the glaciations. Additionally, the project will provide two junior scholars the opportunity to work in the Arctic, gaining exposure to and experience of the logistical and environmental uniqueness of working in these regions. Although the project is specific to the Neoproterozoic, The new approach that couples a wide range of isotope systems will greatly benefit research in the Earth sciences across all timescales. In addition to the scientific research products that will result from this investigation, the PIs will collaborate with the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History and Yale's pre-college ""Pathways to Science"" a program that operates within the New Haven public school system with direct opportunities to experience college and learn more about upper-level STEM education. Multiple undergraduate students at Dartmouth and Yale University will also be involved in sample processing, wet-lab chemistry and mass spectrometry as part of senior thesis projects.

"To fully understand biological systems, as well as realize their full potential, it is essential to integrate research methods and perspectives from the different subdisciplines of biology (including behavior, biophysics, molecular and cellular biology, developmental biology, ecology, evolution, genetics, neurobiology, physiology, systematics, and systems biology). However, how to integrate these subdisciplines is unclear, given the increasingly specialized training in the diversity of analytical and methodological approaches used in different biological fields. Similarly, it is uncertain what new infrastructure - physical and workforce - is needed to achieve a true integration. The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Science will convene an ambitious combination of virtual town halls, microlabs and jumpstart meetings, facilitated by Knowinnovation, to engage the broader biological community and solicit input regarding: 1) the exciting new research questions that could be addressed by combining approaches and perspectives from different subdisciplines of biology, 2) the key challenges and scientific gaps that must be addressed to answer these questions, and 3) the physical infrastructure and workforce training needed. Invitations to participate in the workshops will be posted on the websites of professional societies that span the biological subdisciplines, and participants will be selected with the goal of achieving breadth in expertise, career stage, gender, and members of groups underrepresented in the sciences. Products from the workshops will include a series of publications identifying the opportunities and challenges for integrating across biological subdisciplines and new ways to tackle some of the most challenging biological questions. Results will stimulate new discovery and approaches addressing major societal challenges in the training of next-generation biologists, the response of living systems to changing environments, and the development of sustainable biological resources supporting human populations.

The successful identification of how best to integrate the subdisciplines of biology requires the input and participation of a broad range of researchers across scientific subdisciplines, career levels, and expertise. Two virtual town halls, each with a maximum of 500 participants spanning the biology subdisciplines, will first identify a broad set of common themes. These virtual town halls will be followed by four virtual microlabs of up to 100 participants each (400 people total) to continue refining themes that will be addressed in a combination of in-person and virtual Jumpstart meetings. The fresh thinking and innovative approaches that will emerge from these workshops will advance understanding and further predictive capability of how key properties of living systems emerge from the interaction of genomes, phenotypes, and environment acting over space and time. Identifying the interdisciplinary research needs for integrating biology promises to address key gaps in the basic understanding of biological systems and lead to new insights into the mechanisms regulating the diversification, maintenance, and loss of life on earth, plus novel ways of studying biological interactions across hierarchical levels of organization and species.

"Unlike chronological age (the number of years a person has lived), biological age accounts for environmental, genetic and lifestyle factors that influence the pace of age-related changes. Diet is thought to be one such factor; however, the relationship between diet and biological aging is not well understood, and efforts to characterize this relationship have struggled to disentangle the effects of diet from other variables. This doctoral dissertation project will examine the effect of diet on the rate of biological aging using a newly developed epigenetic clock, a biomarker of biological age. This fundamental research will advance knowledge about human biology, life history, and senescence. The project may also inform public health and aging research by quantifying how lifestyle factors like diet ""get under the skin"" to influence the aging process and age-related disease. In addition, this project will contribute to the education, training and professional development of a female graduate student in a STEM field, and will include science outreach and education activities to engage with K-12 and public audiences.

The mechanisms that regulate the rate of biological aging are unknown but may have origins in the epigenome, a collection of chemical modifications to DNA that influence how genes are turned on or off. The epigenome is able to connect environment to genetics, and therefore plays a key role in explaining how environment and lifestyle factors can shape the pace of biological aging at the molecular level. Recently, age predictor models called epigenetic clocks have been developed that use age-associated changes in the epigenome to generate estimates of biological age. These clocks can be used to study the phenomenon of accelerated aging, where biological age exceeds chronological age. This project will construct a multi-tissue epigenetic clock and use this clock to test the effect of diet on biological age in a non-human primate model. The central hypothesis of this research is that an obesogenic diet accelerates biological aging and caloric restriction slows biological aging. The researchers will collect and analyze genome-wide methylation data from banked liver samples using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and combine these data with previously collected RRBS data from blood samples. A comparative non-human primate model with similar life history and disease risk can provide important insights into human aging.

"Accurate and timely molecular recognition is fundamental to all biological processes. In metabolic assembly (or disassembly) lines, sequential participants are thought to co-localize to maximize the rate at which a final product can emerge from a multi-step pathway.  The investigator proposes to computationally simulate biosynthetic pathway networks in an effort to understand how, despite the complexity of the cellular milieu, binding partners are able to find each other, and biosynthetic pathway flux can be maximized. Through iterations of experiments with collaborators and computation, the investigator will model and predict the effects of co-localization of enzyme activities (the participants) on pathway flux. The overarching goal of the work is to develop software that allows one to accurately simulate how molecular partners find each other in the complex environment of the cell. The work has application to biosensor development, as sensors must also be able to detect their specific targets in a congested and chaotic environment. The project will also contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students. A summer workshop will be organized to train students from local community colleges, universities and high schools. 

Molecular association, in which two or more molecules must find one another, is the first critical step for all biochemical catalysis and (bio)sensing techniques. The project combines multi-level simulations, theoretical work and experimental collaboration to investigate molecular recognition and kinetic enhancements in multi-enzyme systems. To accelerate the overall product synthesis rate, several factors may be considered in designing a multi-enzyme scaffold, including geometry, local charge distribution, and network motions. The design of biosensors is informed by the binding mechanisms of a target and probe. The project explores novel ideas and incorporates results from experiments, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD), and Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations to investigate multi-enzyme nanostructures and large-scale membrane bound biosensors, either in vitro or a cell-like environment. The results offer insight into multi-enzyme and biosensor systems that will inform engineering and biosensor design.

The terminal blood vessels are capillaries, and this is where gas and nutrient exchange with surrounding tissue takes place. Demand for oxygen and nutrients varies with time in specific tissues. For example, cerebral neurons demand more oxygen during increased cognitive activities. Each organ and tissue is able to regulate its blood supply on demand. Blood flow regulation at the capillary level is known as autoregulation, and it involves dilation and contraction of vessels triggered by smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the pre-capillary vessel wall.  Autoregulation allows the capillaries to maintain constant blood flow rates despite sudden changes in pressure. Loss of autoregulation is associated with many pathological conditions, including dementia and coronary disease.  Compliance of blood vessels is the key to the process.  Red blood cells (RBCs) are extremely flexible; their motion through capillaries influences overall blood flow and pressure distributions, which in turn affect activation of pressure-sensitive SMCs. This project will develop a computational model of autoregulation of blood flow by combining RBC deformation, SMC activation, and vessel compliance. The model will provide a detailed understanding of the critical pathways that cause loss of autoregulation and its effects in various diseases such as dementia, stroke, heart disease, kidney failure. The project will involve mentoring graduate and undergraduate students in research, and will engage high-school students through a summer research program.

This project will develop a high-fidelity, three-dimensional, multiscale, multiphysics, fluid-structure interaction (FSI)-based computational model of autoregulation of blood flow in physiologically realistic vascular networks. It will integrate a coarse-grain bio-electro-chemical model for calcium ion-mediated active contractile stress generation in SMCs, finite-strain viscoelastic model for the dynamic response of the blood vessel walls, large deformation of flowing RBCs in suspension, and Immersed Boundary methods to couple the fluid flow with deforming interfaces. The influence of vessel compliance on RBC deformation and distribution, and the role of RBC rheology on vessel deformation will be analyzed quantitatively. The apparent viscosity of blood in compliant vessels, and the effects of vessel compliance on RBC partitioning at vascular bifurcations will also be addressed. Finally, the role of active contraction on the distribution of RBCs in a vascular network, and the role of RBC distribution on active contraction will be studied.

"Fracture and wear are common issues in engineering - to the extent that the terms ""worn,"" ""fractured,"" and ""broken"" are generally synonymous with the end-of-utility of devices. In many cases, traditional materials fail to meet the complex, simultaneous performance requirements that would be ideal for next generation engineering systems. The enamel of the teeth of grazing animals represents one of nature's most remarkable biological materials -- a ceramic-like composite showing exceptional strength, toughness, wear-resistance, and ability to slow crack propagation. This is an important set of properties for a structure that is key to long-term survival in these animals - as functional teeth are required for feeding.  This EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will study these damage-tolerant biomaterials using a combination of evolutionary biology, biomechanics, and materials science. Results and methods from this research will be of considerable interest to investigators in many disciplines, including engineering, materials science, evolutionary biology, ecology, comparative anatomy, mammalogy, and paleontology. The research will also support the development of novel, sustainable materials with improved wear and fracture behavior. Graduate students will be involved in this truly interdisciplinary project and learn how the various fields can work together to tackle challenging questions.  This research will also introduce a more effective, evolutionary approach for exploring nature for biomimetic examples.

The goal of this interdisciplinary research is to specifically understand the biomechanical form, function and performance of enamel lattices, known as Modified Radial Enamel (MRE), in the grinding teeth of large herbivorous mammals.  Samples will be obtained from numerous species, including equines (horses), bovids (e.g. bison and cattle) and suids (e.g. warthogs). This study will specifically focus on how these animals' teeth endure tens to hundreds of millions of high stress contact loading cycles and impacts while chewing tough and abrasive plant matter, such as grasses whose roots are laden with hard, fracture-promoting sediment inclusions. The underlying hypothesis is that MRE is an evolutionarily optimized compromise for: 1) incredible fracture resistance due to prism arrangements that localize damage and strategically control crack direction; 2) unexpected strength and toughness made possible by compliant proteinaceous prism sheaths that circumvent hydroxyapatite's inherent brittleness; and 3) wear resistance conveyed through hard, hyper-mineralized, oriented enamel prisms. The project will investigate this hypothesis through two objectives.  First, the study will use an evolutionary biology approach to identify the ancestral enamel fabric character states to MRE that independently evolved in horses, bovids and warthogs. From this information, it will be possible to readily identify the specific evolutionary modifications to the enamel fabrics that enabled grinding and identify living species that can be used to undertake comparative biomechanical assessment.  Second, the project will investigate the structure-property relationships of the enamel across multiple length scales by comprehensively characterizing the material properties using micro-and nano-mechanical tools, spectroscopy, and advanced electron microscopy. Teeth of grinding species with MRE will be compared with close relatives that retain the ancestral enamel fabrics, thereby revealing the salient anatomical changes that enabled the optimized combination of biomechanical properties.

"Heme is the iron-containing molecule that allows hemoglobin to carry oxygen in blood.  Heme also plays many other important biochemical functions in cells. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Elizabeth Stroupe at Florida State University to study a special form of heme (called siroheme).  Siroheme helps chemically transform environmental sulfur or nitrogen compounds to biologically usable forms using microbes. This research topic is of particular importance because environmental pollution in the form of toxic sulfur byproducts from commercial pig farms has become problematic due to recent flooding in the southern United States.  Dr. Stroupe is studying a key enzyme (CysG) made from two bacteria in order to determine the basic science of siroheme formation.  By knowing how siroheme is formed, scientists may improve upon the bio-remediation of toxic sulfur compounds. The project trains diverse groups of undergraduate and graduate students in molecular structure determinations and follows the biochemical activity of enzymes at various stages of reaction. Dr. Stroupe and her students impart an appreciation for the role that organic chemistry plays in biology to middle and high school students through the SCIGirls and Florida's Next Generation Science Standards outreach programs.

Proteobacteria use a single gene product (CysG) to synthesize siroheme. CsyG is the product of a gene fusion event between a methyltransferase (CysG-A) and a bifunctional dehydrogenase/ferrochelatase (CysG-B). The mechanisms for CysG-B's bifunctionality and its alternative function as a cobaltchelatase are unknown. Other organisms use three distinct enzymes for siroheme synthesis, including the CysG-B homolog SirC, which is a monofunctional dehydrogenase. X-ray crystallography, biochemical analysis, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) are applied to dissect the underlying mechanisms for the last two steps of siroheme synthesis. The questions addressed by this project include how bifunctional active sites in CysG-B catalyze dehydrogenation and metal chelation and how chelatase discriminates between iron and cobalt to make siroheme.  Researchers also ask how CysG-B functions as a bifunctional dehydogenase/ferrochelatase when SirC, a homologous enzyme, only functions as a dehydrogenase.

"Non-technical description: Stretchable electronics have emerged as promising platforms for many important areas such as bio-mimetics, health monitoring, biomedical therapeutics, and soft robotics. This project investigates a set of foundational materials science problems to, for the first time, establish a new electronic materials platform - Si nanomeshes - for next-generation stretchable electronics. The transformative aspect of this project arises from the broad utility of the resulting design and engineering knowledge for nanomesh electronic materials, having profound impacts to not only fundamental materials science but also a broad range of applications in human-electronic interfaces and smart robots. The collaborative team also utilizes this project to integrate creative educational activities with cutting-edge research at multiple levels through: (1) engaging K-12 students via summer research and exhibiting at Oklahoma WONDERtorium Children's museum; (2) actively attracting undergraduate students for early research; and (3) the continuous curriculum development at both Northeastern University and Oklahoma State University to expand capacity in the soft electronic materials field. 

Technical description: Stretchable electronics research has long been facing the dichotomy between device performance and density. In the past decade, there has been significant progress in realizing stretchable semiconductors, however, existing approaches are still incomplete when high-density, high-performance stretchable electronics are needed.

Through both theoretical and experimental investigations, this project aims to investigate and establish the interrelationship of structure-processing-properties of Si nanomeshes for stretchable devices. Key structure variables to investigate include in-plane nanomesh pattern, out-of-plane materials stacking and sidewall surface states, while main properties targeted are mechanical flexibility, stretchability, and carrier transport mobilities.

A set of combined optical and electrical characterizations systematically investigate the properties of sidewall-engineered Si nanomeshes under stretching and scaling. Besides potential applications for high-performance stretchable electronics, this semiconductor nanomesh concept provides a new platform for materials engineering, and is expected to yield a new family of stretchable materials having tunable electronic and optoelectronic properties with customized nanostructures.

"Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Treponema pallidum subp. pallidum bacteria. It has recently reemerged as an urgent worldwide health crisis. The origin of the disease has been a mystery since its sudden appearance in Europe at the end of the 15th century and its subsequent rapid global spread. It has long been debated whether syphilis was introduced to Europe, perhaps from the Americas, or evolved from a form of treponemal infection that had been in Europe all along.  Graduate student Ziyu Wang and collaborators at The Pennsylvania State University will take a multi-faceted approach to investigate the pathogen's genetic diversity over the past 500 years in Europe to explore several possibilities to explain syphilis' origin in Europe. The current T. pallidum pathogens - associated with several related diseases - likely represent only the most successful or recently emerged genetic variants. Examined through an anthropological lens, ancient genomes when considered within the context of human sociocultural systems yield clues about the processes through which pathogens have achieved their evolutionary success. Ultimately a more informed understanding of the factors that contribute to the complex and dynamic interactions between humans and their pathogens provides a deep-time foundation for predicting the evolutionary trajectories of modern infectious pathogens and human responses. Today, as in the past, STI-related stigma has done much to interfere with the development and implementation of effective intervention programs. Lessons learned from historic epidemics and the public response will provide valuable tools for training healthcare professionals, STI high-risk groups, and the public.

To untangle syphilis' origin, its evolution, and its worldwide spread, the research team will sequence T. pallidum genomes from representative specimens sampled from temporally and socially well-characterized European skeletal assemblages dating to the 16th to 19th centuries. Ancient T. pallidum has previously not been well studied because of the limited ability of conventional genetic techniques (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) to recover highly-degraded ancient pathogen DNA. Here a sensitive targeted hybridization capture technique will be used to recover complete, or near-complete, ancient T. pallidum genomes. By comparing temporally known ancient pathogen genomes with their modern equivalents, the research team can track the sequential changes that occurred in the pathogen's genetic history. Doing so will narrow the possible evolutionary scenarios for the origin of syphilis and point to when the pathogen variant that causes syphilis first emerged.

"The 1918 influenza pandemic has been studied from the perspectives of epidemiologists, historians, virologists, and social scientists, providing increasingly more insight on how biology and culture interact to result in unequal mortality outcomes. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate population health and social inequalities that contributed to the 1918 pandemic outcomes, taking into account both influenza and other respiratory illnesses that were circulating during the pandemic. Advancing knowledge about how past behaviors and population structure affected previous pandemic outcomes can contribute to contemporary knowledge of human behaviors, population structure, and potential infectious threats. This project will also support science outreach and education activities at the research location and home institution.

The investigators will analyze the impact of population heterogeneity, specifically in terms of social inequalities, on mortality associated with four respiratory diseases (influenza, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and bronchitis) during the 1918 influenza pandemic on the island of Newfoundland. Newfoundland represents a unique opportunity for the use of historical archival data to reconstruct the political economy, population, and social structure of a pre-industrial society in a way that is directly comparable to its Western neighbors. Early 20th century Newfoundland's urban and rural regions varied greatly in their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics; therefore, research questions will address how age, sex, gendered divisions of labor, crowding, income, and education facilitate social inequality that leads to differential disease mortality. The data used will be collected from the Provincial Archives of Newfoundland & Labrador, and will include yearly vital statistics, death records, newspapers, diaries, photograph collections, and literature. Survival analysis and seasonal regression models will be used to quantify differential mortality across the island, but qualitative data are also critical to understanding the cultural norms of men, women, and children during the early 20th century, and an anthropological perspective on 1918 pandemic mortality. This project is jointly supported by the NSF's Biological Anthropology and Cultural Anthropology programs.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes new biomedical devices based on the use of cellulose nanofiber (CNF), a green, renewable, value-added product, as the material to usher in the new age of biomedical structural materials. Small surgical fixation devices (plates, screws, and pins), bone scaffolds/spacers (orthobiologics), surgical support devices, orthotics, and large wound therapies (negative pressure wound therapy) are all strong potential applications. Currently these markets are collectively valued at ~$20 billion and predicted to grow rapidly by 2025. Preliminary feedback indicates current materials are of inferior quality, not meeting the needs of doctors and patients, are difficult for surgeons to work with, and generally too costly. Titanium alloys are the most prevalent orthopedic material, but they demonstrate significant flaws including excessive stiffness, extreme density, questionable biocompatibility, and the inability for bio-resorption.

This I-Corps project further develops a technology platform that makes it possible to produce porous solid forms derived from composites of the naturally derived fibrillated nanocellulose (CNF). Under the appropriate processing conditions, porous CNF solid-forms can be produced with impressive mechanical properties (porosity, strength-to-weight ratios, modulus, machinability, durability, biocompatibility, dissolution rate), exceeding that of modern plastics.  Based on preliminary results, this material system may exhibit the desired properties for use in a number of healthcare related applications.  Current research seeks to explore the feasibility of this material system to meet the specific requirements of these application areas. Through the I-Corps program this project will focus on identifying the specific needs, including material and design constraints, of medical and healthcare related stakeholders.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project will be to restore the leading role of US cotton by conferring superior quality that distinguishes US cottons in world markets. One of the world's most important crops, cotton enjoys many opportunities to participate in a competitively priced bio-based products industry. Increased durability and strength of cotton fiber offers the opportunity to replace synthetic fibers that require ~230 million barrels of petroleum per year to produce in the USA alone - but fiber quality improvement has been extremely slow. The team expects to accelerate fiber quality improvement by using chemically-induced mutants to bypass the lack of natural genetic variation in the cotton gene pool. The team anticipates addressing the long-standing problem where fiber quality increases at the cost of decreasing yield by identifying and separating the genetic factors causing this effect. Even a small improvement, leveraged over the ~$6 billion value of the US cotton crop alone with an estimated aggregate influence of ~$120 billion/yr on the US gross domestic product, represents a major commercialization opportunity.

The proposed project builds on the demonstration that we can obtain cotton mutants with useful improvements in fiber quality, and that assembly of multiple mutants results in highly superior lines. Here we broaden the pool of superior lines toward a 'pipeline', also determining the impact of these fiber quality traits on fiber yield, identify diagnostic DNA markers that can be used to expedite manipulation of these genes, and narrow the locations of the genes themselves to small intervals in the genome. This project will provide a test of the new hypothesis that genomic regions (quantitative trait loci, QTLs) that determine fiber quality include not merely single genes as long expected, but dozens of genes that function in coordination with one another -- and therefore that the inverse relationship between yield and fiber quality can be overcome by creating and identifying mutations in single genes that change quality traits with minimal disturbance to yield components.  The project will identify prototype cotton 'lines' that are of immediate potential commercial value, as well as a 'pipeline' of ongoing improvements, addressing the 'Red Queen' challenge that we will need to continue to increase our fiber quality as commercial standards rise.

"The overall objective of this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to evaluate the potential for a soil liquefaction mitigation technique in relatively fine-grained soils. This technique uses new advancements in the field of bio-remediation and will be tested in the field at a site located in Portland, Oregon. The project addresses a major seismic problem in Oregon, where many infrastructure facilities are founded on non-plastic to low-plasticity silts that are susceptible to liquefaction in a Magnitude 9 Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake. The site selected for study are near the Critical Energy Infrastructure (CEI) hub located in northwest Portland, where 90 percent of the Oregon's liquid fuel and all jet fuels for Portland's airport are handled. The seismic vulnerability of fuel tanks at the CEI hub is a critical impediment to Oregon's resilience and energy reliability in the wake of a major earthquake. If the mitigation method in this project is proved to be effective in the field, it will provide a vertical step for adopting this solution for infrastructure founded on liquefiable silty soils. This will enhance the resiliency of Oregon after a major earthquake, and it can be adopted in other places with similar subsurface conditions.

This project will evaluate the potential for microbially induced desaturation via dissimilatory reduction of nitrogen (denitrification) to mitigate liquefaction potential in relatively fine-grained soils. We hypothesize that 1) denitrification via two weeks of treatment can lower the degree of saturation to 80 percent in silty soils in the field, 2) this level of desaturation will eliminate pore water pressure generation in treated soils subjected to in-situ cyclic strains, and 3) the desaturation will persist for years due to the small pore size in silty soils (although this will need to be verified in subsequent research). Our approach to evaluate these hypotheses involves in-situ shaking using NHERI@UTexas field equipment at a site before and after treatment, and periodic monitoring of compression (P-) wave velocities during the next 3 to 5 years.

"This award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program enables the study of important electrochemical reaction mechanisms, such as, carbon dioxide electrochemical conversion and electrochemical hydrogenation of unsaturated biofuels on emerging nanocatalysts. In combination with advanced gas chromatography system, this instrument strengthens the product analysis facility at a minority-serving institution, Elizabeth City State University (ECSU).  It also supports both research training and education of underrepresented minority students at ECSU in state-of-the-art research areas such as electrochemistry, nanocatalysts and renewable energy storage systems. This system facilitates several research projects with both domestic and international collaborators. Regionally, two faculty members and numerous students from Old Dominion University (ODU) and Eastern Carolina University (ECU) working on collaborative projects will directly benefit from this facility. 

The award supports the acquisition of a Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (DEMS) system consisting of microflow capillary inlets for research and education at ECSU.  The real time electrochemical reaction intermediates and products analysis by DEMS is at the center of identifying reaction mechanism of several electrochemical reactions and providing fundamental knowledge for the development of efficient nanocatalysts. In one project, research focuses on understanding of carbon dioxide electrochemical reduction mechanism on grain-boundaries or edge atoms of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets. This project further enables the development of an efficient catalytic system consisting of heterogeneous grain-boundaries for efficient carbon dioxide conversion into valuable products. In another project with ODU, this instrument addresses the question of how electrochemical hydrogenation occurs on reduced metal oxide nanostructures to help designing more energy-efficient and cost-effective catalytic system for conversion of bio-oils into transportation fuels.  The gained knowledge will broadly benefit areas related to nanocatalysts, renewable energy storage systems and biofuel production.

"This award funds a symposium, Educating the Vertebrate Morphologists of the 21st Century: technology, pedagogy, and core concepts, at the International Congress of Vertebrate Morphology (ICVM), a triennial meeting of the International Society of Vertebrate Morphology to be held in Prague, Czech Republic, in July 2019. The Congress facilitates international collaboration among researchers working in diverse fields (e.g., developmental biology, paleontology, functional morphology) and provides the opportunity for researchers to interact and to integrate vertebrate morphological research with other fields of biological sciences. Because many of the researchers attending the Congress also teach comparative vertebrate anatomy to undergraduates, the symposium will provide the opportunity to share teaching practices, integrating the field of vertebrate morphology with pedagogical research on how students learn. A major goal of the symposium is to define the core concepts of comparative vertebrate anatomy, a technique used by educators to focus students on learning big ideas and broad concepts instead of memorizing facts. Speakers will share evidence-based strategies for incorporating technological skills (e.g., 3D modeling) and inquiry-based teaching (e.g., social media outreach and service learning). The central goals of the symposium are to make comparative vertebrate anatomy more accessible to diverse student populations and to increase the diversity of future vertebrate anatomists. Both the articulation of core concepts of a field and inquiry-based teaching practices have been shown to foster retention and build problem solving and critical thinking skills. A keynote talk and workshop on inclusive teaching practices in biology are highlights of the symposium, and will be valuable to all scholar-educators in attendance. 
     
The fields of vertebrate morphology and the scholarship of teaching and learning have grown rapidly since the last ICVM teaching workshop was held fifteen years ago. Both comparative vertebrate anatomy and human anatomy are common courses in the teaching repertoire of vertebrate morphologists who identify as teacher-scholars. A lack of well-defined core concepts, which exist for other fields of biology, has kept teacher-scholars of vertebrate morphology from fully implementing evidence-based strategies for teaching and learning. As a result, a misperception exists among students that comparative vertebrate morphology is an antiquated science that relies solely on memorization and has not embraced modern techniques and technology. Furthermore, outdated teaching practices reinforce the barriers to the success of underrepresented students. This symposium will push the boundaries of applying interdisciplinary approaches to the study of vertebrate comparative anatomy in the classroom. The diverse set of symposium speakers will share evidence-based strategies for incorporating technological skills (e.g., 3D visualization and modeling) and inquiry-based teaching (e.g., social media outreach and service learning). The symposium aims to forward the mission of NSF to create an engaged and inclusive community of teachers, students, and scholars.

"This award is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering Environmental, and Transport Systems in the Directorate for Engineering and the Divisions of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and Biological Infrastructure in the Directorate for Biological Sciences. The award expands the scientific capabilities and instrumentation at NSF's ChemMatCARS. NSF's ChemMatCARS is a national user facility for frontier research in chemistry, materials science, bioengineering, environmental engineering, and molecular biosciences that employs high-energy synchrotron X-rays at the Advanced Photon Source located at Argonne National Laboratory. Experimental stations at NSF's ChemMatCARS serve a broad national and international community of scientists providing unique capabilities not found anywhere else in the world. Research activities address vital societal issues, including the development of new energy sources, biomolecular materials inspired by biological processes, studies of interactions that help in understanding the rules of life, environmental remediation processes, and new materials and catalysts important for a wide range of industries. This award supports the expansion of NSF's ChemMatCARS sector from one beamline to two, thereby providing opportunities for innovative development of new capabilities and enhanced capacity to meet the scientific needs of a larger user community. The facility serves as a training ground for researchers at all levels of education and carries out numerous activities to develop and diversify the future STEM workforce.

The upgrade of NSF ChemMatCARS enables improved performance and increased user access to new experimental techniques including serial X-ray crystallography, low energy resonant diffraction, the study of liquid-solid interfaces, scanning transmission interfacial scattering, and coherent X-ray surface imaging. The award supports the design and construction of a new beamline as well as two experimental stations that are supplied with X-rays from an independent, second high-energy insertion device (undulator) consisting of superconducting magnets. Beamtime available for experiments at NSF's ChemMatCARS is being doubled, allowing for the development of new techniques and new areas of inquiry. An upcoming upgrade of the Advanced Photon Source will produce an X-ray beam with 100-fold greater brightness and coherent flux enabling new sciences and shorter experiment times. Serial X-ray crystallography of small molecules is being developed to study the structural dynamics of irreversible chemical and physical reactions and processes, that have proven challenging to characterize on the atomic scale. Lower energy X-rays on the new beamline extend the capabilities of resonant diffraction to provide complete coverage of 3d and 4d transition metals, thereby enhancing investigations to replace precious metals with earth-abundant materials for catalysis. In the area of liquid interfaces, new techniques are addressing the challenge of characterizing the heterogeneity of liquid surfaces and interfaces on the nanoscale. The study of liquid-solid interfaces is made possible by new instrumentation capable of addressing a wide range of scientific problems in the areas of water purification, protein-membrane interactions for bio-signaling and transport, and electrolyte-electrode interactions for catalysis and energy applications.

"This award will support a symposium, ""Building Bridges from Genome to Phenome: Molecules, Methods and Models,"" at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) meeting in Austin, Texas, Jan. 3-7, 2020. The oral and poster presentations and related activities will cover a broad range of scientific efforts to understand how genes can shape species-specific characteristics while also giving rise to individual variation. Understanding the mechanistic basis by which genes give rise to both stability and variation in phenotypes is one of the Grand Challenges articulated by NSF. Scientists in many disciplines are taking a wide variety of approaches to dissect the mechanistic bases by which genes give rise to phenotypes, called genome-to-phenome studies. The goal of this Symposium will be to build connections among the most successful of these research efforts, as well as to identify key gaps and future needs to accelerate and facilitate this critical area of research. Activities of the Building Bridges Symposium are designed to encourage and support presentations and participation by established and new investigators, as well as postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate researchers representing diversity in gender and ethnicity, and with expertise in the wide range of disciplines represented within SICB. Taken together, the Symposium activities aim to facilitate rapid and insightful progress toward understanding the processes underlying constancy and variation, making it possible for species to be resilient in a changing world. Presentations from the Symposium, and a summary paper resulting from the Symposium and associated activities, will be widely disseminated via publication in the SICB journal.

The Symposium is organized by members of the NSF-supported Animal Genome-to-Phenome Research Coordination Network (AG2P RCN), which was established five years ago. The AG2P RCN's first symposium and policy workshop were conducted at the 2016 SICB Meeting. The white paper resulting from that workshop emphasized the need to standardize and lower the barriers for analysis of transcriptomic data, so that scientists from many disciplines and research environments could develop consensus approaches for the ""taking-off point"" for linking genomic with phenotypic diversity. Since 2016, there has been a huge proliferation of experimental organisms as well as of large and complex datasets describing various levels of biological organization, all aiming to elucidate aspects of the genome-to-phenome framework. The 2020 Building Bridges Symposium aims to identify and bridge gaps in this framework and the most promising future directions for genome-to-phenome research. In addition to oral and poster presentations, the Symposium includes an introductory session to initiate exchange of ideas and contact information, (2) a Twitter feed to gather comments from SICB members regarding major barriers to integrating data across disciplines, levels of organization and models, and (3) a policy workshop to outline a white paper identifying major gaps, key barriers and leading edges in the field of genome-to-phenome research. The Symposium and related activities will use an interdisciplinary collaborative model that will provide meaningful professional and scientific development opportunities as well as formal and informal opportunities for participants to network with each other across disciplines, gender, ethnicity, and professional ranks. All presentations in the Symposium will be published in the SICB journal and thereby will be widely disseminated and have abroader impact on the field.

This conference is being co-funded by the Integrative Ecological Physiology and Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Programs within NSF-BIO-Integrative Organismal Biology.

"This doctoral dissertation project will examine the evolutionary history of gelada monkeys (genus Theropithecus) based on skeletal and genetic data. Species of this group occur more broadly and in larger numbers than any other non-human primate in the fossil record of Africa. Fossils have been found in southern, eastern, and northern Africa, the Middle East, Spain, and even India, an unusual distribution for any primate group besides humans. The living representatives of this group, however, are only found in the highlands of Ethiopia. Because of their overlap with humans in the past, these monkeys have often been suggested as a model for understanding human evolution. Therefore, the in-depth analysis of gelada monkeys will not just provide better insight into the evolution of this group but will also advance the study of human evolution. This project will support graduate student training, and results from the project will be presented to the general public through the American Museum of Natural History Sackler Educational Laboratory's ""Meet the Scientist"" program.

The main goal of this project is to fully understand the evolutionary relationships, taxonomy and paleobiology of the primate genus Theropithecus. All available cranio-dental data for both living and extinct members of this group will be compiled. Morphometric data in the form of 3D landmarks and 2D measurements, as well as morphological data in the form of character states, will be collected. Genetic data will also be collected, thereby resulting in a large, integrated dataset for this primate group. This comprehensive dataset will then be used to: assess the morphological as well as genetic differences among the living populations of Theropithecus gelada; inform research on fossil populations; provide a comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction of the genus Theropithecus; investigate the dietary trends seen in this genus and their relationship to cranio-dental morphological trends; and investigate the cause of the extreme facial morphology exhibited by some species of this genus and evaluate whether that is related to diet, sexual selection or some other factor. As part of this study a new and relatively unknown population of an extant endemic primate will be analyzed and provide new insights for conservation purposes.

"This project aims to study a general system of partial differential equations called hyperbolic-parabolic balance laws, with two specific applications in mind: one in bio-medicine and another in gas dynamics. There is a variety of gas-dynamic phenomena that can be described mathematically by hyperbolic-parabolic balance laws. The swirl of complicated gas flows surrounding a space vehicle reentering the Earth's atmosphere is probably one of the most spectacular examples for which these balance laws serve as a (simplified) mathematical description. The second application motivating this research is chemotaxis, the movement of micro-organisms in response to a chemical stimulus. The mechanism of chemotaxis is ubiquitous in biology and medicine, from migration of bacteria or leukocytes to cancer metastasis. Arising from the physical world, the parabolic-hyperbolic systems do not fit exactly into the traditional classification in the theory of partial different equations, and the solutions' behavior is governed by both hyperbolicity and parabolicity, plus a chemical reaction. Integrated into the research activities of the project there is an educational component. It includes curriculum development of hand-on modeling of real-world problems by partial differential equations, one-on-one research mentorship to undergraduate students, and direct participation of research by Ph.D. students. The project encourages the participation of students at all levels, especially students from under-represented groups.

The project has two principal mathematical objectives. The first objective is to study the stability of equilibrium solutions. This is to understand how an initial perturbation, such as inaccuracy in measurement, propagates into the solution. The project team is particularly interested in the wave pattern formed by perturbation at long time. The research unifies the theories on hyperbolic balance laws and hyperbolic-parabolic conservation laws in this regard. It has direct application to gas flows in translational and vibrational non-equilibrium. The second objective is to study another model system, Keller-Segel-Fisher/KPP system, beyond the application of the above general theory. It is a chemotaxis model that has logarithmic sensitivity and logistic growth. Here the logarithmic sensitivity is to account for Fechner's law: Subjective sensation is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. An important practical problem is what happens if the chemical signal is near void at one end of the domain. This is equivalent to the logarithmic function is near its singular point. In the project, we carry out an in-depth investigation into such a situation. The goals are existence of solution global in time, large time behavior, and possibly large data solutions or strong wave solutions.

This project is jointly funded by the Applied Mathematics Program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"This project will bring together scholars, students, and community members representing language documentation research projects funded by the National Science Foundation/National Endowment for the Humanities Documenting Endangered Languages Program (DEL) in order to participate in three organized sessions at the annual meeting of the Linguistic Society of America (LSA). Since its inception in 2003, DEL has funded hundreds of institutes and conferences, fellowships, and doctoral dissertations. In addition to ""standard"" documentation projects, increasingly, projects have come to include cross-disciplinary collaboration benefitting language revitalization and teaching, and community collaboration and capacity-building. These events will offer the opportunity for both reflection on significant achievements from DEL projects in the past fifteen years, and also for discussion about what directions documentation, archival preservation, and revitalization projects should take for the future. These events will allow participants to demonstrate how the science of documentation research can be co-constructed, from project conception, through to methods, and on to outputs, via considering indigenous interpretations and knowledge. The events will also allow participants to share how their documentation research has facilitated construction of sustainable community collaborations and educational opportunities, and fostered the rethinking of power distribution in situations of community involvement in documentation research. Broader impacts include the cross-pollination of ideas from different disciplinary perspectives, the potential for increased participation by Native Hawaiians, Alaska Natives and American Indians, historically underrepresented groups in linguistics, and the evaluation of the impact of federal funding from two distinct agencies in terms of intellectual merit and broader impacts, merit review criteria at NSF determined by the National Science Board.

These events are scheduled to coincide with and complement LSA-organized celebrations of the 2019 International Year of Indigenous Languages. Led by two NSF DEL award holders, the events will provide a platform for case studies of demonstrating the relevance of documentation research to science more generally, and also how funded projects provide training opportunities for community members, and members' roles in valuable resource creation. Importantly, the project will support the attendance of students and community partners, allowing for multiple viewpoints and perspectives about shaping and conducting documenting research for, by, and with language communities. The methodology employed will include pre-event dialogue between participants and project leaders to shape presentations and discussions according to project goals, and will also include allotted time during the events for audience-participant interaction. The outcomes of this project will articulate and promote community-based approaches toward the conceptualization and carryout of future documentation research. The participant collaborators will disseminate recommendations and best practices for community-oriented documentation research, and through post-conference publications, they will also provide examples and resources for future project directors and those with whom they partner.

"This proposal requests funding to support the registration and/or travel of undergraduate and graduate students and trainees across the State of Florida and the United States, so that they can attend the upcoming 2019 NanoFlorida International Conference. The College of Pharmacy Graduate Programs at the University of South Florida, Tampa, FL will host the conference with an aim to provide new perspectives on challenges and opportunities for improving nanotechnology applications in various sectors including medicine, pharmacy, agriculture, energy and environment sectors. The NanoFlorida Conference is a unique event with a long, successful tradition of student researchers sharing their discoveries in nanotechnology within the State of Florida. It includes all 12 State Universities including Florida A&M (a minority institution) and Bethune Cookman University, both historically black universities, and schools in the Florida State University System that have an enrollment of 60% women. For the first time, the NanoFlorida Conference, traditionally restricted to Florida, has been extended to include students from the USA and from around the world and thus renamed as the NanoFlorida International Conference. The conference will include symposia addressing advances on nanomaterials and devices for biosensing, and their applications in energy, medicine, and agricultural sciences; and provide new opportunities for students to network with researchers from academic institutions and the broader nanotechnology industry. NSF funding will reimburse the registration fees and/or travel of up to two hundred students, enabling more students to participate. This in turn increases the beneficial impact of these new professional development activities for students.

The conference will 1) create a forum for researchers in fields of nano- and nanobio- technologies for scientific exchange and to help identify emerging challenges at the frontiers of nanoscience and nanotechnology; 2) promote and foster collaborative research ties and networking opportunities within the nanoscience communities in Florida, across the US, and globally; 3) foster and encourage collaborative research efforts between academicians from different Florida universities and institutes and beyond nationally and internationally; 4) forge strong industry-academia partnerships in the field of nanoscience and nanoengineering technology to promote market driven research and innovation in Florida and beyond; and 5) encourage and showcase the contributions of undergraduate and graduate, students and postdoctoral trainees by creating a student-friendly event where they can present their research among their peers thereby ensuring a new generation of nano-bio scientists. Thus, the conference will have a dominant student component with an emphasis on participation, enhancement of leadership and success. Students will meet researchers from other schools and from industry, and these professional relationships will provide long-term benefits to students' careers in STEM fields. NanoFlorida conferences are an educational experience that reveals to students the latest nanobiotechnology research and its applications. Learning about nanobiotechnology, developing communication skills, and networking with researchers from academia and industry are important steps that prepare students to join the nanotechnological workforce upon their graduation. Post-conference surveys and the publication of presenter research will serve as a measure of the success of this conference.

"Viruses have evolved self-destruct mechanisms that allow them to release their contents when they are inside the right host. The viruses are decorated with molecules that trigger their degradation when they encounter specific enzymes found within certain biological systems. Using inspiration from how virus particles respond to their environment in highly specific ways, the research group of Professor Jessica Rouge at the University of Connecticut is developing new chemical strategies to synthesize shells of very small size that can both controllably encapsulate small molecules and release them in response to specific stimuli in complex mixtures. Such strategies are important for developing more sensitive biological sensors and more accurate drug delivery systems.  This project provides graduate and undergraduate students multidisciplinary research training in nanoscience, chemical synthesis, and biochemistry.  In addition, an initiative entitled ""Catalyzing Curie-osity"" is launched to engage high school teachers and students throughout the state of Connecticut.  Through this joint initiative with the UConn Early College Experience program, affordable lab protocols are being designed focusing on the fundamental tools and techniques of bio-nanoscience. These lab modules will be individually tailored to the needs and resources of specific high schools, giving students hands -n experience with this exciting class of nanomaterials and preparing them for future careers related to nanotechnology and chemistry. 

With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program, the Rouge Group is developing novel chemical crosslinking strategies that can be incorporated into DNA nanomaterials for controlling their assembly and disassembly in complex biological environments. Using a novel DNA-surfactant assembly strategy that generates DNA nanoshells compatible with cells and enzymes, the major goal of this work is to synthesize a combination of peptide and synthetic crosslinkages that can maintain the nanomaterials stability in biological systems while exhibiting selectivity for certain chemical and biochemical stimuli. These stimuli, including temperature and pH changes, or exposure to specific enzyme classes, will be used to gate the release of small molecules for initiating chemical and/or biochemical reactions. Through this work the following goals are addressed: 1) the design of a library of thermoresponsive crosslinkers that enables remotely controlled substrate release, 2) the design of ligand-cargo communication schemes for sensing the local environment of the DNA-nanoshells, and 3) control over solution reaction selectivity via stepwise substrate release from multi-layered peptide crosslinked DNA-nanoshells. Compartmentalization of different substrates within the DNA-nanoshell layers will allow the team to study release rates and subsequent reaction rates of diverse molecules in aqueous systems.

"With support from the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources (IUSE: EHR), this project aims to serve the national interest of supporting improved teaching and learning in Introductory Biology courses.  This project intends to support a 3-day conference to bring together key decision-makers, stakeholders, and undergraduate introductory biology instructors.  It aims to foster collaborative relationships and take actions necessary to advance the introductory biology experience for all undergraduate students.  Results from a recent survey found that even among National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) membership, adoption of policies and practices that promote three-dimensional learning are severely lacking. In addition, precollege students taking introductory biology (e.g. Advanced Placement) courses are more likely to be exposed to contemporary pedagogies than current undergraduates, suggesting a disconnect between college-readiness and college reality.  The proposed conference seeks to identify ways to mitigate these issues and advance the introductory biology curriculum by focusing on a shared vision of the undergraduate introductory biology experience. This conference will purposefully include instructors from all settings, institutions, relevant organizations, and other stakeholders to create collaborations that will serve multiple purposes.  

The conference is intended to generate Research-Practice Partnerships to strengthen the introductory biology experience for all students by fostering new partnerships, leveraging resources, and creating shared experiences among practitioners, researchers, and other stakeholders. The project will incorporate specific strategies that have been demonstrated to promote learning, self-confidence, and interest in the sciences, especially among those students who are underrepresented in the sciences. These include High-Impact Practices (Association of American Colleges and Universities) as well as the integration of content and skills and interventions to deal with misconceptions.  The project leadership team represents collaboration from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the University of Oklahoma, the NABT, and Northwestern Connecticut Community College.  In addition, the project includes representatives of several additional stakeholder efforts in biology education, such as the Partnership for Undergraduate Life Science Education (PULSE) and the Science Education for New Civic Engagements and Responsibilities (SENCER).  The NABT Introductory Biology Task Force, a group with roots in the Introductory Biology Project RCN-UBE, serves as the conference organizing committee.  It includes stakeholders from additional institutions of higher education, a school district, and the Educational Testing Service. The conference will place participants into working groups based on pre-conference survey data.  The groups will be given guidance for creating action plans with the overall goal of increasing successful implementation of standards that improve science practice skills in introductory biology.  The project aims to engage 60 participants in the three-day conference hosted at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Conference Center.  It is expected that this work will result in a more unified vision for the Introductory Biology curriculum of the future, a strategic plan for implementing and designing this curriculum in any classroom and the formation of networks and collaborations among instructors, researchers, and other stakeholders.  Ultimately, this project intends to implement a project that articulates a shared vision of biology education for the future, to outline a research-based model of Introductory Biology experiences focusing on how best to prepare biology students to meet that future, and to build a permanent communication network that connects and increases the number of individuals, projects, and organizations actively engaged in the reform of the Introductory Biology course.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

"With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Professor Tobin J. Marks of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Professor Marks and his coworkers are discovering, understanding, and optimizing new catalytic reactions, and closely combining this effort with educational outreach activities. Such catalytic processes are of great importance to the U.S. chemical industry, and it is estimated that catalysis underpins 25% of the U.S. GDP, producing fertilizers, fuels, plastics, pharmaceuticals, coatings, and other chemicals on a huge scale. Future catalytic transformations must be more efficient, non-toxic, non-polluting, and use low-cost, earth-abundant metals in more selective, sustainable, and economically competitive technologies. Addressing these challenges will require a skilled National technical workforce, and US universities are playing a major role by broadly educating young scientists to attack global-scale problems, while conducting excellent research across broad disciplinary fronts. Projects funded by this award involve a multi-faceted, educationally rigorous mix of catalyst creation, catalytic reactions, and understanding reaction products. This, combined with a highly interactive research group environment, provides excellent training/mentoring for graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral scholars planning industrial, national laboratory, or academic careers, and includes women and underrepresented minorities. 

This research is built around two integrated exploratory, hypothesis-driven themes stimulated by the unique properties of earth-abundant lanthanide (4f), actinide (5f), and d0 early transition metal complexes. In the first, catalytic reactions that create or cleave carbon-heteroelement bonds via non-traditional pathways are being developed. Unusual catalysts are being used to selectively create heteroatom (boron, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus) bonds to important chemical building blocks such as olefins, alkynes, ketones, aldehydes, esters and amides, either in single or in closely coupled multiple steps. Useful substances with diverse ring structures such as pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals and being produced by this work. Topics being studied include chiral ligands for pharma-related enantioselective catalytic processes, and catalytic systems capable of reversing the aforementioned bond-forming processes to deconstruct bio-based feedstocks and other heteroatom-containing molecules. In the second theme, catalyst nuclearity effects applied to unusual olefin polymerization and hydroelementation processes are being studied. The team is using designed catalytic centers to effect polymerization reactions which link unsaturated building blocks, including those with normally deactivating polar and basic groups, to produce plastic materials with superior bulk properties including mechanical or processing properties, and/or surface properties such as adhesion, wettability, water-repellence, compatibility with other polymers, or bacteriocidal characteristics. Catalyst design includes ways to orchestrate cooperative enzyme-like processes that are ""switched on"" when two catalytic centers are placed in close but variable proximity with the objective of achieving unique polymerization processes. These include polymerization reactions to produce novel types of polymer architectures derived from catalysts in which two cooperating metal centers have similar or different, complementary reactivities. A second goal with such catalysts is bond-forming processes which create expanded structures accessible only by the cooperative interaction of two catalytic metal centers.

"With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division and the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems are funding Dr. Mohammad R. Seyedsayamdost from Princeton University to discover novel reactions carried out by metalloenzymes during natural product biosynthesis. Natural products are small molecules synthesized by diverse microorganisms and released into the environment where they have varied biological functions.  The natural products are also a major source of therapeutics. Metalloenzymes are often implicated in the production of these molecules, but the reactions that they catalyze are in most cases unknown. The proposed experiments help define the transformations catalyzed by hundreds of metalloenzymes during natural product biosynthesis. In doing so, the research expands the chemical repertoire of metalloenzymes and delineate new biosynthetic strategies, which may be used in the industrial production of commodity molecules. At the same time, the experimental plan enables rigorous training for of graduate and undergraduate students who do research at the interface of chemistry and biology. The project is integrated into an outreach program designed to grow the scientific skills of teachers at local high schools.

The recent explosion in microbial genome sequences has brought to light an abundance of new metalloenzymes. With the substrates of many of these enzymes unknown, mining this daunting and novel catalytic landscape is a big challenge. In this project, a bioinformatic approach is used to link substrates to yet uncharacterized metalloenzymes. The reactions carried out by these enzymes are then elucidated using biological experiments, NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Their detailed mechanisms is the subject of spectroscopic and kinetic studies. These investigations broaden the reaction scope of metalloenzymes and define new biosynthetic pathways. The results will shed light on the strategies that nature utilizes to catalyze difficult transformations during the synthesis of complex natural products.

"Currently, there is no reliable test for early diagnosis of first time or recurrent epithelial ovarian cancers. This project will develop a new technique of micropipette thermography, which, if successful, will lead to new insights into mechanisms of cancer progression, early cancer detection, and early cancer diagnosis.  This research proposes that specific cell types possess characteristic responses to heat that can be used to identify the cell type. Characterization of this property may introduce a new class of cellular thermal markers for normal or diseased cells. Significant broader impacts included the training and mentorship of graduate, undergraduate and high school students in thermal sciences. This will occur through hands-on learning experiences in the nano and bioengineering program that will combine approaches from different fields of study to reveal information about a life process.

The current project objectives are: (1) to determine the thermal characterization profiles of a cell line panel of serous epithelial ovarian cancer progression. A 3D model of epithelial ovarian cancer will be prepared as a test bed. Microsensors and the accompanying technical method for both the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity from previous published work will be used on clinically relevant serous epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines; (2) to correlate the thermal characterization profile with the proliferation characterization profile as a Transition Prediction Model in epithelial ovarian cancer. Subsequent analysis of the thermal-probed cells will use fluorescence analysis to determine resazurin-detected proliferation. A linear regression analysis will be performed to determine whether the profiles for thermal characterization along with proliferation characterization are correlated with cancer transition. It is noted that novel thermal properties could supersede the current paradigm which emphasizes the reliance on extensive genomic and proteomic analyses. Moreover, the added value of this project is the identification of (and continued inquiry to understand) cellular inherent thermal properties. The technology and method, if successful, will allow for a non-invasive tool, faster diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer with expedited next step bio-specimen determinations for early validation of the method and technology. Indeed, this empirical study of thermodynamics cell properties will advance recently proposed theories of heat transfer roles in metabolic reprogramming, bioenergetics, and oxidation-reduction metabolism status in cancer cell survival.  This kind of novel discovery will open doors for new therapies. Furthermore, future real-time diagnosis at the location of the cells in question, when combined with laparoscopy, may result in early detection and diagnosis. This technology ostensibly will extend to other circulating blood tumors and disease models, providing for future advancements in cancer detection and therapy solutions. Underrepresented students will be the first-choice recruits through the University of North Texas McNair Scholars Program, National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates program. Texas Academy of Mathematics and Sciences high school program will also be included.

"Fifty thousand years ago, modern humans dispersing out of Africa to Europe and Asia met now-extinct human relatives, such as Neanderthals, and interbred with them. As a result, genetic variation from Neanderthals exists in the human gene pool, but the effects of this variation on human biology are not well understood. In this doctoral dissertation project, the researcher will conduct a large-scale laboratory-based genetic experiment to test whether Neanderthal variants can affect the degree to which a gene is active in human immune cells. By identifying these variants and making publicly available the raw data from this experiment, the researchers will advance knowledge about the effects of evolutionary history and genetic variation on the immune system of living humans. Given that science news often features stories about Neanderthals, the researchers will utilize popular interest in this area to demonstrate the biological and medical relevance of studying human evolutionary history. They will also work with two museums to develop an exhibit that will additionally highlight the practical importance of this field of research. Furthermore, this project will help promote women in science given that the research will largely be undertaken by a female graduate student who is committed to training other women in science and has been active in the organization for Graduate Women in Science Engineering at her university. 

Although the last two decades have seen great strides in genetic research, because the specific function of most of the human genome is still unknown, researchers face difficulty when trying to connect most specific genetic mutations to their effect on biology. To aid in this discovery, datasets have been produced that allow correlations between the presence of genetic variation and biological phenotypes. However, because genetic variants near each other are often inherited together, it can be difficult to determine which genetic variant is responsible for the biological effect, limiting the ability to truly understand the mechanism. This is especially true in the case of Neanderthal genetic sequences present in living humans, which mostly lay in poorly understood parts of the genome that are thought generally to regulate the expression of genes. Nonetheless, correlational evidence suggests that this Neanderthal genetic variation may be affecting human immune system function. The researchers will conduct an experiment in which they simultaneously test thousands of Neanderthal genetic variants and their human counterparts for their ability to regulate the expression of genes in the immune system, in order to isolate the specific Neanderthal genetic variants that affect the biology of the human immune system. This will allow researchers to focus future work on specific functional testing of these important genetic variants.  Furthermore, by directly comparing correlational findings to the results in a laboratory experiment, this research will deepen the understanding of these commonly used genetic datasets.

"Flexible flapping wings are an important component in several developing technologies with potential to benefit national infrastructure and welfare. For example, miniature robotic vehicles with flapping wings could be deployed to identify leaks in dense networks of pipes, to survey air quality, or even to artificially pollinate crops. Flapping wings could also be used to harvest energy and thus power a sensor network for specific applications. However, engineering tools are not sufficiently evolved to utilize flexible flapping wings for these emerging technologies. Methods currently used to predict the physics of flapping wings are inefficient, often requiring long time to estimate the performance of just a single flapping wing system. As such, they cannot be used for real-time control applications where the system must adapt rapidly to dynamic environmental conditions. The primary goal of this award is therefore to develop efficient and rapid experimental methods to predict the physics governing flapping flexible wings. Such methods will advance the design for flapping wing technologies. This award will support American Indian students recruited through Montana State University's EMPower program. It will also promote science, technology, engineering and math fields through public outreach activities including Montana State Family Science Day and National Biomechanics Day.  

This project specifically aims to realize a reduced-order fluid-structure interaction model of flapping wings.  Conventional fluid-structure interaction models rely on coupled finite element and computational fluid dynamics solvers, both which require considerable computational resources.  Existing low-order approaches are typically restricted to rigid wings and cannot account for the aerodynamic forces that result from elastic structural deformation.  The model developed through this work will deliver solution accuracy near that of high-fidelity solvers with the computational efficiency achieved by low-order methods.  This model will be applied to study both artificial wings as well as real insect wings and will be realized by accomplishing the following objectives.  First, wings will be geometrically, structurally, and aerodynamically characterized via a combination of micro-computed-tomography scans, computational fluid dynamics, experimental modal analysis, and model updating routines.  Second, the fluid-structure interaction framework will be derived using a novel deformable blade element momentum approach.  Deformed wing aerodynamics are accounted for e&#64259;ciently through a predetermined look-up table of coe&#64259;cients and dynamic correction factors that will be incorporated into the quasi-steady model as necessary. This low-order model will initially be benchmarked against direct high-fidelity computational simulation. Third, the model will be validated experimentally. A linkage mechanism will be used to generate flapping kinematics.  Wing strain, aerodynamic forces and torques will be measured and compared to theoretic predictions. The expected outcome of this project is a robust fluid-structure interaction framework capable of supporting real-time control as well as parametric design of flapping, flexible wing technologies.

This project is jointly funded by CBET-Fluid Dynamics, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and BIO-IOS programs.

"Lignin is an abundant natural resource whose higher carbon content, when compared to cellulose and hemicellulose, makes it a very attractive renewable feedstock for producing fuels and chemicals. Lignin liquefaction is a promising process for converting this underutilized resource into monomeric phenols that can be easily upgraded to fuels and chemicals, but the underlying chemical kinetic processes are not well understood. This collaborative research project aims to develop a rational framework that integrates modelling and experimental tools to explicitly account for lignin and its oligomeric intermediate chemical structures at relevant liquefaction conditions in the presence or absence of solvents.

Lignin liquefaction can be conducted in aqueous environments (hydrothermal liquefaction), in organic solvents (solvolysis), in ionic liquids or in solvent free conditions (pyrolysis). Assigning a realistic chemical formula to lignin and its oligomeric intermediates is one of the major challenges to rationally describe and control lignin liquefaction reactions. The mechanisms by which solvents and additives impact liquefaction reactions are also poorly understood. Because of this, lignin liquefaction remains an art rather than a science. The main goal of this project is to develop a rational micro-kinetic framework based on detailed micro-kinetic models describing depolymerization and repolymerization reactions and intermediate products removal mechanisms during lignin liquefaction. The practical goal is to use this mathematical model and experimental tools to identify suitable lignin liquefaction strategies in the presence of solvents and acid-base catalysts to maximize mono-phenol production which will facilitate further bio-oil upgrading in existing infrastructure. In addition to training two graduate students the principal investigators plan to host female and underrepresented minority high school students in their laboratories as summer research interns through the Summer Research Opportunity Program at Northwestern University and the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.

"Natural products are rich in biologically active (bioactive) compounds and serve as great sources for drug discovery. One of the major challenges in screening drug leads from natural products is the lack of effective tools to identify and separate the bioactive compounds. This project will develop and characterize a new magnetic separation approach based on cell membrane-encapsulated iron oxide superparticles (a cluster of nanoparticles) for the separation and identification of bioactive compounds from natural products. This method overcomes limitations of costly and time-intensive conventional approaches and the nonspecific binding problems of magnetic bead separation techniques. The new approach is also broadly applicable to many different types of transmembrane drug targets. The success of this project will advance industrial processes for identification and extraction of new drug leads from complex samples. The impact of this project will be further enhanced through student-led educational and outreach activities, including: (a) establishing a goal-oriented training mechanism and relevant course work for undergraduate researchers and (b) developing a STEM lead the way program with an emphasis on math concept building. Specific science outreach projects to be developed are Science middle school-targeted Olympiad training modules and magnetic fishing experiments for elementary school students through the ""Science Party for Kids"" program. 

The objective of this project is to develop a new magnetic separation approach based on cell membrane-encapsulated iron oxide superparticles (CSMPs) for the identification and separation of bioactive compounds from natural products. CSMPs will feature immobilized cell membranes with fully functional receptors that allow for identification of compounds specifically binding to the transmembrane receptors. The full encapsulation of magnetic superparticles inside a cell membrane overcomes the non-specific binding problems associated with the current magnetic bead separation technology. The use of magnetic superparticles enables rapid identification and extraction of compounds targeting transmembrane proteins. The CSMP approach is also easily translated to different transmembrane protein targets, which significantly broadens the applicability of this separation technique. Toward the overall objective, the PIs will develop, characterize, and evaluate the CSMP approach using cell membranes with functional nicotinic receptors to effectively identify binding compounds both in an artificial mixture (known binders and non-binders) and cigarette smoke condensates. The technique will be further verified using cell membranes with functional transient receptor potential (TRP) channels (e.g., TRPV1) and voltage-gated sodium channels. Both types of receptors have been shown as valid targets for the development of novel analgesic drugs. The outcome of the project will be fundamental knowledge related to efficient separation of bioactive compounds from complex matrices.

"Nontechnical Abstract
This project supported by the Biomaterials program in the Materials Research Division is to develop a novel material called Rolled Scaffold (RS) and to build a next generation of bioreactors based on RS for large-scale cell culture. With recent progress in biotechnology, animal cells are used to produce protein-based drugs and diagnostic antibodies. Also, stem cells are investigated as effective cures for degenerative diseases that are previously incurable. These applications require large-scale bioreactors with higher efficiency and reliability than currently available ones. The unique microstructure of RS provides very high surface-area to volume ratio and allows efficient flow of culture media through it, making RS ideal material for high-density adherent culture. Unlike conventional bioreactors, the bioreactor based on RS separates the cells from the culture media reservoir, allowing sufficient aeration of media and removal of cellular bio-waste without cellular damages. These improvements are expected to significantly reduce the production cost in biopharmaceutical industries and facilitate the introduction of exciting clinical applications of stem cells. 

Technical Abstract
Suspension culture in stirred tank bioreactors are widely used to culture animal cells in large scale. However, harmful hydrodynamic shear stress and insufficient mass transfer rate of nutrients and gases limit efficiency and reliability of suspension culture in large scale. In this project, PI aims to develop novel RS bioreactors to overcome inherent limitations of suspension culture. RS is a thin polymer film with spacers that are rolled into a cylinder containing numerous identical microfluidic channels. Cells are growing in inner surfaces of RS and culture media flows through the microfluidic channels in a laminar flow. The RS can provide very large cell culture area and high mass transfer rate of nutrients and gases with minimal shear stress. In addition, separation of cells from media reservoir allows novel configurations of RS-based bioreactors. PI plans (1) to develop a mass-production setup of RS, (2) to develop a dialysis RS-bioreactor that can effectively remove cellular waste from the media for efficient production of therapeutic proteins, and (3) to implement a RS-bioreactor with low-temperature media storage that can extend lifetime of heat-sensitive signaling molecules in culture media for affordable stem cell production. Besides, this project seeks to develop self-sustainable STEM curriculum for high school, to promote STEM literacy among young students through various outreach activities, and to train graduate and undergraduate student into future workforce in biomaterials area through active research participation with priorities to female and underrepresented groups in STEM.

"Optoelectronic substrates form a critical component in a variety of functional devices where the substrate functions to allow light to pass through and, at the same time, protect the device from the ambient environment. Applications include displays, solar cells, smart phones, tablets, light emitting diodes (LEDs), as well as emerging flexible versions of these optoelectronic devices such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, artificial skin, and e-paper. The availability of high performance, optoelectronic devices greatly impacts technologies such as wearables, the Internet of Things, and more, thus contributing to the nation's economy and security. Currently, rigid glass substrates are typically used with an antireflection layer. However, these coatings do not provide for antireflection across a wide range of wavelengths or angles and lack other desired multi-functionality. This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) program award supports research to create a framework for applying machine learning methods to nanomanufacturing processes. A specific goal is to utilize the machine learning and optimization approach to design and construct nanophotonic structures on surfaces to achieve different optical properties such as anti-fogging and anti-bacterial. Additive nanomanufacturing is a versatile method to create complex 3D structures with nano-scale features. Since many surface engineering designs and functions are possible, a machine learning approach is needed. The project studies nanomanufacturing approaches involving maskless and scalable etching and deposition processes that are commonly used in the semiconductor device fabrication industry. This research activity is highly multidisciplinary and exemplifies the unique role that industrial engineering and materials engineering play in the future of nanomanufacturing research and in training the future workforce.

The project creates a framework that integrates nanomanufacturing methods, such as reactive ion etching, with machine learning and optimization tools, physical simulations, and multi-functional characterizations to demonstrate durable and flexible nanostructured optoelectronic substrates with high performance photon management properties, such as antireflection and haze management. Most of the recent work in surface engineering of multi-functional nanostructure coatings for a wide variety of rigid and emerging flexible optoelectronic devices has involved traditional trial-and-error approaches that offer, at best, fragmented and limited systematic studies of small regions of the parameter space absent any embedded historical knowledge. Major challenges exist in demonstrating the scalability of manufacturing processes. This research seeks to test the hypothesis that a machine learning and optimization framework can be utilized to more rapidly design and engineer optoelectronic substrates compared to current incremental approaches. Machine learning methods are integrated to fit experimental data, predict the performance of new structures, and provide heuristics for additional experiments. Current limitations are overcome through the creation of new machine learning methods that succinctly learn nanostructure-additive NanoManufacturing-property relationships with the ability to generalize across domains. Machine learning models are developed to determine how to manufacture 3D nanostructured surfaces on glass and plastics using additive nanomanufacturing.

"Permafrost, or perennially frozen ground, holds a large reservoir of carbon. The overarching goal of this study is to look to the recent geologic past to improve understanding of how future changes in climate may impact carbon accumulation and release. The investigators have combined expertise in paleoecology, paleoclimatology, surficial geology, geochronology, and quantitiative geomorphology. Together, they will quantify the relationship between climate and the mass of carbon that accumulated under distinctly different climates of the past 40,000 years in hilly upland regions of the Arctic, which will complment previous work on the effects of climate change on permafrost carbon in lakes and peatlands of low-lying terrain. Results will add paleo perspectives to the Permafrost Carbon Network, part of the Study of Environmental Arctic Change. The project will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students, and the team of investigators includes an early career scientist.

In this study, the investigators will combine field-collections, analysis of sediment cores, and modeling to quantify the millennial scale relationship between climate and permafrost carbon accumulation at an upland study site in the Eight Mile Lake watershed in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range. They will take multiple sediment cores along hillslope transects to map the underlying stratigraphic framework; contrast the surficial materials mantling both a short and a long slope to infer the relative roles of slope-length- versus slope-angle-dependent transport processes; and use these data in a numerical model to simulate hillslope evolution and assess downslope geomorphic processes that transfer sediment and sequester carbon. The investigators will also use radiocarbon dating of macrofossils to determine the extent to which organic matter has been stratigraphically mixed and to distninguish millennial-scale periods of accumulation; evaluate pollen and macrofossiles for community characteristics and grain size distributions; and analyze sediment sequences for a suite of bio-physical properties to quantify carbon mass, accumulation, and decomposition.

Proposal #: 1653925

A critical challenge in biomedical engineering is a need to control the process of blood vessel formation, also known as ""angiogenesis."" Controlling angiogenesis is important, because blood vessels supply the nutrients necessary for our organs and tissues to function properly. Efforts to control angiogenesis in cancer focus on starving and possibly killing the tumor by cutting off tumor blood supply, typically by looking at a single protein. This project proposes to overcome current limitations in this type of cancer therapy and meet the general challenge of controlling angiogenesis by tackling a more difficult, ""big-data""-like problem: understanding how combinations of proteins control angiogenesis. This project will tackle the problem by: 1) experimentally determining important protein characteristics; 2) determining mathematical equations that describe the behaviors of these proteins; and 3) developing computer simulations that include both the experimental data and the mathematical equations to determine how the proteins work to cause angiogenesis.   The education and outreach portion of this project will introduce sophomores to research and computer modeling in an introductory-level course in order to excite them about STEM.  The activities will include mentoring of underrepresented students to increase their interest and persistence within STEM majors.

The directed control of angiogenesis remains a pressing need due to its involvement in the pathology of over 70 diseases. A promising approach for angiogenesis control involves going beyond the traditional emphasis on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-VEGF receptor (VEGFR) axis towards a new focus: cross-axis signaling (protein binding across families). The objective in this project is to pioneer a shift towards understanding cross-axis angiogenic signaling via three aims grounded in quantitative biology (qBio),  omputational biology (cBio), and integrative systems biology (sBio).  Quantitative biology will be used to measure cross-axis binding and concentrations or relevant protein ligands, including through the development of new quantitative tools for multiplex measurement of receptor concentrations. Computational biology will be used to construct validated cross-axis models that will predict how adapter activation contributes to angiogenic hallmarks, cell proliferation, and migration.  Systems biology will be used to predict the role of cross-axis signaling in angiogenesis by applying the qBio and cBio tools to angiogenesis in vitro. Ligand, receptor, and adapter
concentrations will be measured, and the magnitude of cross-axis signaling will be predicted. These predictions will be validated by
demonstrating control of vessel formation (inhibition and stimulation) in vitro.  This research will be integrated with teaching by creating undergraduate research pathways via a core course. This will introduce systems biology to sophomore students who will develop computational models of ligand-receptor signaling in angiogenesis.  Students will also be offered opportunities to continue their work within the PI's research laboratory. Additional mentoring will be provided to underrepresented students to support their persistence within STEM fields.","Saint Louis","Washington University","47.041","367984","Engineering of Biomed Systems","1923151","imoukhuede@wustl.edu","Princess","Imoukhuede","06/06/2019","09/01/2018","03/31/2023","CAREER: qBio+cBio=sBio; Identifying the role of cross-family signaling in angiogenesis","BIO"
"Protein-carbohydrate recognitions are crucial events in many biological processes including cell-cell communication, immune response, cancer development and metastasis.  Understanding specific interactions between carbohydrates and carbohydrate-binding proteins has been a challenging task due to the lack of versatile probes.  Organic color centers created on nanomaterial hosts with precise optical and carbohydrate functionalities are uniquely suited to profile protein-carbohydrate recognition, which can lead to clarifying functions of both molecules and their underlying molecular mechanism and discovering therapeutic and diagnostic mechanism as well.  This project will promote the progress in science by advancing fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships of engineered organic color centers with biological functionalities and establishing the probing behavior of carbohydrate-functionalized color centers for specific biological targets in either physiological and pathological pathways.  In addition to advancing an emerging frontier across nanotechnology, chemistry, glycoscience, and engineering, this work will positively impact the well-being of society.  First, this work will contribute to the development of the next-generation multicolor fluorescent probes with precise functionalities for biomedical research and applications.  Second, this project will provide exciting opportunities to students of all backgrounds through promoting engaged learning via hands-on research in an evolving interdisciplinary field of nanomaterial science and technology and glycosciences.  It will further support the advancement of a broadly inclusive, next-generation science and engineering workforce, particularly in bio-nanotechnology.

This project will focus on probing specific interactions between carbohydrates and proteins by engineered organic color centers with the goal of achieving new nanomaterial tools to detect targeted molecular interactions in biological processes with enhanced sensitivity and selectivity.  The proposed color centers will be created through covalently functionalizing the sidewall of semiconducting, pure-chirality single-wall carbon nanotubes via oriented immobilization of glycopolymers that closely mimic the natural glycan structures and functions.  There are many advantages for the proposed color centers.  First, chirality-defined carbon nanotube hosts have defined structures and properties and color centers created on nanotubes further tune light in the near-infrared regime that has attenuated autofluorescence and deep tissue penetration, providing the ideal condition for high contrast fluorescence detection in complicated biological samples.  Second, pure-chirality carbon nanotubes promote advances in ultra-low dose, high efficiency nanomedicines.  Third, biomimetic, precision synthesized glycopolymers mimic the three-dimensional display of carbohydrates on the cell surfaces, thus warrant enhanced sensitivity and selectivity for proteins.  Particularly, the proposed work will involve i) synthesizing organic color centers using galactose-containing glycopolymers with different carbohydrate ligand densities, ii) determining how the galactose pendent groups of glycopolymers mediate the specific interaction of color centers with asialoglycoprotein receptor of human hepatoma cells, and iii) assessing the basal toxicity and functionality of organic color centers for selectively identifying human hepatoma cells utilizing both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cell cultures.  Here, microarray three-dimensional bioprinting of cell cultures provides in vivo-like microenvironments to better asses the toxicity and selectivity of nanomaterials-based color centers, which could be used as biocompatible, cancer cell-targeting multicolor fluorescent probes.  Optical properties of engineered organic color centers and their specific interactions with proteins and human liver cancer cells will be characterized primarily by optical spectroscopy of color centers, high-content imaging assays, and near-infrared fluorescence imaging.  The combinatorial diversity of nanotube structure and glycopolymer configuration offers vast potential for chemical innovation and biochemical sensing and imaging advancement.  If successful, this work will provide a transformative approach to study the carbohydrate recognition in biology that is essential to uncover molecular mechanisms of many biological processes.  This work will also open up possibilities to create a new class of multicolor fluorescent probes with distinct properties that are previously never achieved for many applications, such as biosensing and bioimaging.

"Providing clean water and safe drug delivery are grand societal challenges.  The field of nanotechnology offers ways to address both challenges.  However, the manufacture of nanoparticles and, in particular, sub-10 nm particles needed to support these revolutionary solutions is plagued by low yield and long production times.  Conventional production of self-assembled nanomaterials is highly time consuming with poor control of structural uniformity due to undesired and uncontrolled inter-particle interactions under particle thermal fluctuation. This grant supports fundamental research to develop a scalable nanomanufacturing process for high-throughput production of nanocolloidal assemblies. The new approach that integrates rapid electrospray and microfluidic processes solves the current bottleneck in slow and low-yield manufacturing of hierarchically structured nanomaterials. The success of this research impacts U.S. manufacturing, economy, and security. This project uniquely integrates multiple disciplines including manufacturing, fluid mechanics, materials science, and device fabrication. The multidisciplinary approach helps recruit and train students, including women and underrepresented minorities, as the next generation of U.S. engineers, thus positively impacting engineering education. 

Many manufacturing approaches have utilized external fields, such as electrical and optical fields, to overcome colloidal thermal fluctuations and direct the assembly of colloidal nanoparticles. However, scalable nanomanufacturing processes to rapidly and precisely assemble nanocolloids of 10 nm or smaller size, including noble metal and metal oxide nanoclusters and (bio)polymers, remain few and challenging. This project develops an integrated electrospray and microfluidic manufacturing process to rapidly concentrate inorganic nanoclusters and polymers in droplet nanoreactors and control their hierarchical nanocolloidal assembly by dielectrophoresis. Ultrafast laser spectroscopy is integrated with the continuous microfluidic process to enable in-situ characterization of the compositions and assembly process of building hierarchical nanocolloids in liquid media. Results obtained from this research advance the fundamental understanding of nanoscale electrokinetic behavior of complex nanomaterials. Both electrospray and dielectrophoresis microfluidic modules can be linearly scaled-up to pioneer high-throughput nanomanufacturing of multi-component and structured nanocolloidal assemblies.

"Quantum dots are extremely small nanocrystals of semiconductors that are 100,000 times smaller than a grain of salt and contain just a few thousand atoms.  When exposed to light, quantum dots luminesce, and the color of their emitted light depends on their size.  It is these unique optical properties that make quantum dots useful in applications ranging from cell phones to light emitting diodes (LEDs).  Quantum dots have also attracted the attention of the biotechnology community due to their potential use in bioimaging and biosensing applications. However, most quantum dots contain heavy metals like cadmium and lead that are toxic to living cells and their surfaces quickly become coated with proteins and lipids that degrade their stability.  With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Zeev Rosenzweig in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) is developing non-toxic quantum dots from indium phosphide. Working with his students and collaborator Dr. Karen Leinkamp at Albert-Ludwigs Universitat in Germany, Professor Rosenzweig is modifying the surface of the quantum dots with novel polymers that inhibit the formation of protein corona on their surface, allowing them to maintain their bright luminescence and stability in biological solutions. Their discoveries could have broad implications for using semiconductor quantum dots in biological applications. The project provides interdisciplinary research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students involved. Professor Rosenzweig and his team are also actively engaged in outreach to nearby high schools to introduce students to concepts in nanoscience and nanotechnology, including their impact on human health and the environment.

Highly emitting quantum dots (QDs) are currently limited in their chemical stability in complex biological media, and in their cellular targeting efficiency due to protein corona formation. The project is addressing these limitations, enabling the use of InPZn/ZnS QDs as non-toxic bioimaging probes. The goals of the project are realized through the following specific aims: Aim 1) Modifying the surface of InPZn/ZnS QD with oxonorbornene-based polymers that allow systematic functionalization of the polymer side chains to inhibit corona formation. Aim 2) Development and use of a high-resolution fluorescence microscopy system, typically used in single molecule fluorescence studies, to follow in real time the process of protein corona formation on InPZn/ZnS QDs without photodegradation, or the need for large quantities of nanoparticles. Aim 3) Demonstrate that the surface modification of InPZn/ZnS QDs with oxonorbornene polymers results in protein corona formation inhibition, and increased macrophage targeting efficiency.  The project provides interdisciplinary research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.  It also enhances the recruitment of students from underrepresented groups to scientific research in nanomaterials chemistry through partnership with the national Interdisciplinary Consortium for Research and Educational Access in Science and Engineering (INCREASE).

"Supercooled large droplets (SLDs), which include freezing drizzle drops and freezing raindrops, are up to 100 times larger than the cloud-sized droplets that are involved in most in-flight aircraft icing incidents.  When SLDs impinge on airframe surfaces, they often impact on regions beyond the protection of current anti-/de-icing systems and splash into secondary droplets that sprinkle unprotected areas.  This causes surface water runback and uncontrolled ice accretion.  Aircraft icing due to SLDs, which occurs more frequently than first thought, is now recognized as a significant hazard. This collaborative research project will use a combination of experiments and modeling to understand underlying physics of SLD icing phenomena so that effective anti-/de-icing measures can be implemented to ensure safer and more efficient operation of aircraft in cold weather.  The research team will collaborate scientists at other government agencies and aerospace companies to further broaden the impacts of the research.  The project will train graduate and undergraduate students in research and will develop educational tools that will inspire high school students, especially those from groups underrepresented in STEM fields, to continue in science and engineering studies.

The overall goal of this collaborative research is to conduct an integrated theoretical, numerical and experimental research to quantify important micro-physical processes, such as droplet impact, rebounding, splashing, surface water runback, and ice accretion, that are pertinent to SLD icing phenomena.  Results will improve our understanding of the underlying physics for safer and more efficient operation of aircraft in atmospheric icing conditions. The research tasks include: 1) develop an SLD icing simulation tool based on a validated multiphase flow solver with a novel moment of fluid interface representation method; 2) conduct theoretical, experimental and numerical studies to characterize droplet impinging, rebounding and splashing on dry and wet surfaces pertinent to SLD icing to develop droplet impact models that contain a comprehensive consideration of controlling factors ignored in previous studies; and 3) perform an integrated numerical and experimental investigation to examine the characteristics of surface water runback and its effects on SLD icing.  The research program will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate curricula by adding a new teaching module and creating new courseware to stimulate students? interests in thermal-fluid sciences.  Students from underrepresented groups will be recruited proactively to work on the proposed research to promote participation in science and engineering.

"The 8th Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Plant Metabolic Engineering is scheduled for Jun 16-21 in Il Ciocco, Italy.  Increasing populations and urbanization are compounding factors that impact future food, water, and energy demands.  Plants contain a remarkable metabolic diversity that is just beginning to be tapped to address those challenges such as increasing crop yields, enhancing food production, and engineering plants to produce novel chemical products.  Advances in reading and writing the DNA of plant genomes as well as the ability to exploit the diversity of natural metabolic production in plants are allowing plant scientists to engineer plants with improved and novel traits.  This conference is focused on recently breakthroughs and advances in methods of engineering plant metabolic pathways with applications in engineering plants for the production of biofuels, improved fiber, pharmaceutical products, better animal feed, fragrances, flavors, and nutrition.  The outcomes of this conference will provide global scientists the opportunity to exchange ideas and knowledge, and learn about new technologies and scientific advances to plant metabolic engineering.  In addition, this conference provides a seminar series targeted at students, postdocs, and other scientists entering the field to provide additional training and knowledge exchange opportunities.

The 2019 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and accompanying Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Plant Metabolic Engineering will build on the successes of previous GRCs that have focused on pathway discovery and recently on using the concepts and approaches of synthetic biology to guide plant metabolic engineering more effectively towards products and applications. Constraints (and opportunities) afforded by intracellular compartmentation, complex regulatory control mechanisms and multicellular context have rendered the discovery and design of plant metabolic pathways inherently more challenging than for microbial pathways. During the conference presentations from leading exponents of engineering fuel, fiber, pharma, feed, fragrance, flavors and food in plants, will highlight important future technologies that will facilitate both plant metabolic engineering and implementation strategies. A final objective is to build stronger networks between those working on plant metabolic engineering in the USA, Europe and Asia.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project spans chemical manufacturing, pharmaceutical development, and agricultural biotechnology. This technology helps protein engineers take a candidate protein and make it more robust to chemical or environmental perturbations. In one application, this technology could be used to extend the half-life of pharmaceutical candidates during development. In another application, it could enable substituting toxic and wasteful chemistries with suitable enzymatic chemistries. These algorithms may help drive new green chemistries presently inaccessible because although the necessary enzymes can perform a desired catalysis, they cannot stay folded long enough for commercial use.  In a third application, the technology can help improve the shelf life of these critical drugs, thereby expanding the population they might benefit.

This I-Corps project leverages machine learning to accelerate protein engineering. Convolutional neural networks have recently become the preferred artificial intelligence (AI) solution to a number of computer vision challenges, yet their biological applications remain scarce. Proteins, strings of folded amino acids that drive most biological processes, are exponentially being crystallized to solve their three-dimensional structure. This project combines these two resources by training a 3D convolutional neural network that characterizes chemical environments unique to each of the 20 amino acids. The same neural network can then predict the amino acid best fitting a given environment.

"The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-B Program supports the fundamental research by Professor Alexander Greer at the City University of New York, Brooklyn College. Professor Greer develops techniques for accurately studying the chemistry of reactive oxygen-containing species, often called reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). ROIs are important in synthetic chemistry and are critical to understanding the aging processes in biology and in the environment. This research seeks to resolve mechanistic questions in ROI chemistry by using newly synthesized micro- and nanoparticles. Further scientific impact comes from designing materials which are resistant to aging caused by exposure to light and oxygen. The project supports training of research students.  Professor Greer cultivates STEM talent and enthusiasm for the sciences within a wider and younger audience by expanding the American Society of Photobiology's program ""Photobiology for Kids"", among other educational efforts in collaboration with Brooklyn College?s Annual High School Chemistry Day. 
 
Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs; oxygen radicals and singlet oxygen) are prevalent in the field of aerobic photochemistry, but they have proven extremely difficult to study. Many primary light-dependent and secondary ROIs generation events remain undefined. At present, photosensitization has been used with conventional methods of production, such as homogeneous solution, which leads to complex mixtures of ROIs. This research seeks to understand the downstream reactions that follow initial photooxidation events and to control the oxidation of natural and synthetic molecules, to reduce toxicity to organisms and damage to materials, and to develop new methods for disinfection of water supplies.  This fundamental research may also lead to new processes for the rapid photodegradation of plastics in landfills and oceans.  New heterogeneous methods for the photogeneration of reactive oxygen intermediates are investigated, allowing the ROIs to be rationally manipulated with effective tuning of reactivity. The research provides a method for phase separation that facilitates the deconvolution of complex photochemical processes. One key feature of studying downstream reactions of primarily formed peroxides is the ability to gain insight into multistage oxidative events.

"This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology.  The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase participation in groups underrepresented in biology. This fellowship will examine how shifts in coral reef biodiversity and productivity impact the natural resiliency of atoll islands to sea level rise.  Atoll reefs and islands are linked such that islands are composed entirely of sand and rubble that is derived from the nearshore reef.  Atoll reef-islands are highly significant as they provide the only habitable land in certain regions of the Pacific, and the loss of these islands is directly tied to cultural identity. It is widely recognized among indigenous and underrepresented communities that there is a need for culturally relevant applications of scientific and environmental processes. To broaden participation of Pacific Island peoples in Biology the fellow will partner with local educators in Hawaii to develop K-12 curriculum for communities with a high native Hawaiian population.  Furthermore the University of Hawaii at Hilo is a minority serving institution and provides an excellent setting for the fellow to mentor undergraduate students in all aspects of the research project.

This fellowship will elucidate the bio-geological linkages that enable or limit island resiliency within Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in the context of future sea level rise and other environmental stressors.  Long-term photographic survey data (2012-2019) will be used for photogrammetric 3D reconstruction of nearshore coral communities.  3D reconstructions of each reef study site will be used to characterize temporal and spatial shifts in reef composition, coral health, and 3D architectural complexity. Reef community composition will be compared to atoll reef-island sediments to identify key island building species and their relative abundance on modern reefs.  Reef framework productivity (sediment rates) and erosion will be quantified from 3D reconstructions to assess sediment availability for island building and maintenance. An improved understanding of how coral reefs respond to environmental stressors will guide efforts within Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, and across Pacific Island nations aimed at protecting low lying atoll islands and islanders.

"This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Fruit color plays an essential role in the life cycle of many plants by attracting animals who eat the fruits and carry the seeds away from the parent plant. Blue fruits are relatively rare, and some produce vivid colors without the use of pigments. They accomplish this via nano-scale structures in their cell walls that interfere with light to produce color. This research will identify new species that exhibit such structurally colored fruits, and describe the bio-physical mechanisms responsible for these colors. In addition, this work will examine the evolution of structural color in fruits from a group of trees native to Australia, the Indo-Pacific, and Southeast Asia. The project will inform our understanding of the evolution of rare traits (such as blue fruit color) as well as provide a platform for multi-disciplinary interaction between biologists, physicists, and material scientists. In addition, this work will provide training for the fellow and undergraduates who will be involved in the work. The project's findings will be disseminated through scholarly publications and conferences as well as to the public via outreach activities.

The paucity of known structurally colored fruits has limited hypotheses about the ecological function of structural color in fruits and the circumstances behind its evolution. Northeast Australia has a relatively high number of blue-fruited species, including two of the known structurally colored fruits, E. angustifolius and Delarbrea michieana. The fellow will rely on both herbarium and living collections in botanical gardens to 1) survey herbarium collections for new species that may exhibit structural color, 2) describe the biophysical mechanism behind structural color in new species using optical and transmission electron microscopy, and 3) test the hypothesis that structural color serves as an honest signal of high nutritional reward in Elaeocarpus using phylogenetic comparative methods. The fellow will quantify a variety of color, nutritional content, morphological traits, and cell wall nanostructures across Elaeocarpus. She will collaborate with an interdisciplinary team at the University of Colorado-Boulder and the University of Cambridge, train biology and physics undergrads, and participate in science outreach activities in both locations. The research has the potential for bioinspired and biomimetic engineering applications, and will improve our understanding of the origin, evolution, and ecology of rare structural colors.

"This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs.  Professor Kenneth Hanson from Florida State University and colleague Lei Zhu have acquired an ultrafast transient absorption laser spectrometer. Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for monitoring a sample's change in energy absorbance (i. e., color) with respect to time after excitation by a flash of light from a laser. TA is employed to study photochemistry and photophysical processes such as the conversion of sunlight into energy. Such processes can be very fast, on a time scale of a femtosecond which is 14 orders of magnitude faster than 1 second.  The ultrafast laser system is used to characterize new materials which have desirable properties such as better solar cells or light emitting diodes. The spectrometer is used to train students in ultrafast technology and applications at Florida State University and other institutions including the neighboring HBCU Florida A&M University as well as Central Florida University, New College of Florida, Virginia Military Institute and the University of South Carolina. 

The award will enhance research and education broadly. One research area being investigated is photocurrent generation in materials with self-assembled organic-inorganic interfaces. Fluorescent molecules that can emit simultaneously at different wavelengths for applications including bio-imaging are also currently investigated. The properties of photomagnets, a fundamentally interesting and technologically promising group of light responsive materials, are being evaluated. Halide perovskite are intensively studied for their remarkable performance in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells. Exciton self-trapping (or excited state structural reorganization) processes in low dimensional organic metal halide hybrids with unique photophysical properties are also studied in a collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

"This EAGER project aims to realize the biodegradable epidermal devices by fabricating fully water-soluble zinc sensors on a water-soluble and ultra-smooth galactomannan substrate that is obtained from seeds with an environmentally-friendly aqueous extraction method. While there has been increasing attention to exploring biocompatible and biodegradable materials for implantable monitors and disposable epidermal sensors, the substrates are often associated with poor biodegradability, high surface roughness, lack of conformability, and expensive chemical synthesis approaches. In this project, various zinc sensors on the nature-derived galactomannan substrate will be fabricated, characterized, and benchmarked. The resulting disposable electronics can be programmed to dissolve in water, and further produce environmentally benign end-products, which can be used for alkaline soil amendments. Considering the numerous human health benefits such as reducing blood glucose and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of the water-soluble galactomannan, the results from this study will also enable the future development of biomedical implants. Additionally, the research will be tightly coupled with a comprehensive educational program that will expose undergraduate and underrepresented students to interdisciplinary technologies through early engagement and research training on the design and fabrication of fully water-soluble sensors. 

Significant efforts have been devoted to reducing the bending stiffness of epidermal devices to improve the contact quality at the device-skin interface and to yield high-quality sensing data. As the bending stiffness of the device is primarily affected by the modulus and thickness of each device layer, successful demonstrations include the use of low-modulus substrate or exploration of thin device structures. However, the materials are limited in the former, and low-cost fabrication is challenging in the latter. Additionally, non-water-soluble properties of both classes create electronic waste streams, posing environmental concerns. An innovative, fully water-soluble bioelectronic device is proposed in which zinc sensors are fabricated on the galactomannan substrate through a low-cost fabrication process. The objective of this project is to carry out a feasibility study that water-soluble bioelectronics on a skin-conforming galactomannan film can form a conformal contact with the hierarchically textured skin surface and reduce the contact impedance. Two research tasks are proposed to accomplish the feasibility study: (1) fabricating capacitive zinc electrodes and temperature sensors on the skin-conforming galactomannan films, and (2) characterizing water-soluble zinc sensors to benchmark their performance, particularly against motion artifacts. By following arbitrary skin deformations without mechanical failure, the new class of fully disposable, high-performance, and low-cost electronic devices can significantly improve the contact quality at the device-skin interface and reduce the susceptibility to motion artifacts.

"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will develop a new experimental technique to characterize the nonlinear thermodynamic and kinetic properties of gels. Defying the classical definitions of solid and fluid, gels are both solid-like and fluid-like. They are both ubiquitous components of natural organisms and important engineering materials. Despite their wide applications, the design of these materials at this stage remains mostly trial-and-error due to a lack of fundamental understanding of the complex thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors of gels. The success of this work will lead to a robust and high throughput technique capable of measuring the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of soft gels under wide range of conditions and provide a standard toolbox for engineers to realize quantitative designs based on these materials. The PI will also expand a Soft Squishy Lab to combine visual, tactile and hands-on modules to connect human perception of macroscopic properties to the underlying microstructures of soft materials at appropriate levels for K-12 students.

Gels are composed of crosslinked polymer network and solvent molecules. The crosslinks prevent the long polymers from dissolving in the solvent; rather the gel swells and shrinks as the small molecules migrate in and out. The solvent uptake is a two-way street: as the solvent diffuses into the network, the network deforms, leading to size and shape changes, while the deformation of the network also affects the rate and amount of solvent diffusing into or out of the network. Both the concepts and the behaviors of gels are sufficiently complex such that ample room exists for additional work to connect principles of mechanics, thermodynamics, and kinetics to experiments. The proposed study will develop a technique based on an indentation method for characterizing the nonlinear thermodynamic and kinetic properties of gels. The new technique will allow for systematic characterization of various types of stimuli-responsive gels under different environmental conditions. Based on a complete set of data from the systematic measurements, an in-depth understanding of the structure-property relations of gels can be achieved. Consequently, a physics-based constitutive model will be built.","","Georgia Tech Research Corporation","47.041","355520","Mechanics of Materials and Str","1935154","yuhang.hu@me.gatech.edu","Yuhang","Hu","05/16/2019","02/01/2019","01/31/2022","CAREER: Mechanics and Physics at the Boundary Between Solid and Fluid: Probing the Thermodynamic and Kinetic Properties of Gels","BIO"
"This project aims to understand and predict how proteins (i.e., transcription factors) that turn genes on-and-off develop the means to process information and interact with nearby surroundings. The mechanism in which proteins process signal information is called allosteric communication. While the study of allosteric communication has been underway for more than four decades, critical details of these fundamental processes are still poorly understood. This gap in knowledge prevents scientists and engineers from designing new proteins with custom-built communication abilities. Accordingly, the focus of the current project is to elucidate the rules that will enable scientists to build allosteric communication in a family of transcription factors that process a broad range of signals. This research will expand the scientific communities understanding of allosteric communication and enable the development of new tools that can be used to benefit society (e.g., new and less expensive process controls for bio-industrial applications, and systems for use in personalized medicine). Moreover, this project will involve the training and education of the next generation of scientists, specifically Ph.D. level graduate students.
    
Protein allostery is a vitally important protein function that has proven to be a vexing problem to understand at the molecular level. Allosteric communication is a hallmark of many transcription factors used to control gene expression and have enabled synthetic biologist to reprogram cells. The specific goal of this research is to leverage the basic structure and function relationship of the lactose repressor (LacI) to systematically map and engineer alternate allosteric communication, in several LacI/GalR homologues. Answering the fundamental question of whether allostery in the broader LacI/GalR family has been evolved to be controlled by a set of conserved residues or whether the protein is plastic and predisposed to allostery across different residue sequences will ultimately give insights into allosteric structure-function relationships and aid in the engineering of novel transcription factors. Mapping allostery and determining the evolutionary origin, links, and mechanism by which allostery is conferred in the LacI/GalR family will provide crucial knowledge into how other proteins may be designed to exhibit allostery and how to control and modulate allostery in existing systems. Upon completion, this study will enable scientist to test assertions with regard to the origin and molecular mechanics of alternate allosteric communication via the development of design rules for specific allosteric operations. In turn this algorithm will produce novel LacI/GalR-based transcription factors for use in a broad range of biotechnological applications.  This project is co-funded by the Molecular Biophysics and the Systems and Synthetic Biology programs of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.

"With the emergence of social media and high-definition video streaming, there is a growing need for a more efficient way to process streams of visual information in terms of both bandwidth and energy. Currently, conventional image sensors record visual information frame by frame, unnecessarily acquiring huge amounts of redundant data since most pixels often may not change from one frame to the next. Inspired by the human brain, this project will develop a neuromorphic vision system, which is driven by the timings of changes in the dynamics of the input signal instead of the conventional image-based stroboscopic acquisition. This work will lead to transformative advances in bio-inspired neuromorphic processing architectures, sensing, with major applications in self-driving vehicles, neural prosthetics, robotics, and general artificial intelligence. The project team will work closely with local communities to encourage participation by students from all backgrounds including underrepresented group in computing careers by fostering interest in neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence through outreach activities including lab demonstrations, summer internships, and career workshops. 

The objective of this project is to build a brain-inspired vision system by integrating a neuromorphic, event-based silicon retina with a spiking neural network (SNN). In most existing neuromorphic vision systems, the communication between the event-based camera and the computing system is still limited by the memory bottleneck, largely negating the benefits of the large bandwidth and low power consumption of the neuromorphic camera. This project will: (1) build a spiking neural network with realistic graphene-based dynamic synapses allowing advanced computational capabilities; (2) develop a brain-inspired machine learning and general computation capabilities; (3) connect the developed hardware with a neuromorphic event-based silicon retina to demonstrate real-time operating vision system with orders of magnitude better energy efficiency and bandwidth.

"Bacteria employ a wide variety of iron-containing enzymes to breakdown natural and human-generated compounds in the environment.  Such reactions commonly proceed by cleaving the carbon-carbon bonds of the molecules in a process that requires dioxygen (O2) from the atmosphere.  The mechanism by which biological iron sites facilitate these O2-dependent reactions is not fully understood, which hinders the design of man-made molecules capable of using O2 as a cheap and environmentally-friendly oxidant.  In this project, Dr. Adam Fiedler is generating a series of model systems, ranging from small complexes to supramolecular assemblies, to obtain molecular-level insights into the O2 reactivity of iron in both biological and man-made contexts.  A powerful combination of spectroscopic and computational tools is utilized to characterize unstable and transient species that have been proposed (but rarely observed) in Nature.  In this way, the project provides a more complete picture of reactions that are essential for the remediation of polluted soils and groundwaters.  The interdisciplinary nature of the project offers a valuable training experience in both experimental and theoretical methods for graduate and undergraduate students.  Dr. Adam Fiedler collaborates with local teachers to engage high-school students in activities that combine chemistry with artistic expression.  This outreach program exposes students to concepts and instrumentation used in the project, thereby increasing scientific literacy and the chances that students pursue college degrees in science. 

With funding from the CSDM-B Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Adam Fiedler of Marquette University is developing synthetic iron-containing complexes that mimic key features of nonheme iron dioxygenases.  Dioxygenases that cleave carbon-carbon bonds are critical for the microbial degradation and assimilation of organic compounds that arise from both natural and human sources.  However, the O2 activation mechanisms employed by these enzymes are not fully understood. In particular, there is uncertainty regarding the geometric and electronic factors that govern the reactivity of pivotal intermediates featuring superoxo, peroxo, and/or substrate radical ligands.  This project combines coordination chemistry, reaction kinetics, spectroscopic techniques, and computational methods to illuminate the complex relationships between structure and reactivity in bio-inspired iron complexes, including transient intermediates of catalytic significance.  In addition, new approaches for incorporating well-defined second- and third-sphere ligand architectures are developed.  These efforts provide fundamental knowledge regarding O2 activation processes in a variety of metalloenzymes and aid in the design of new oxidation catalysts.  The methods used in this research offer interdisciplinary training for undergraduate and graduate-level scientists.  Dr. Adam Fiedler is also engaged in outreach activities directed towards high-school students that stimulate interest in science by emphasizing the visually appealing aspects of inorganic chemistry and crystallography.

"Bones differ in shape and size throughout an animal's body and between animal species, but the underlying genetic mechanisms that result in different looking bones are not well understood. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate DNA ""instruction manuals,"" particularly the ""switches"" that turn gene expression on or off during development, that result in shape differences in hip and shoulder bones of humans and chimpanzees. The project will advance knowledge about hip and shoulder developmental genetics in the context of modern human skeletal evolution. The project will support graduate research and training; 1-2 undergraduates also will have the opportunity to gain lab experience. The co-PI will use her work in a Life Science Outreach program at Harvard University as an opportunity to discuss this research and other facets of human evolution and genetics with New England high school biology teachers and students, ideally recruiting interested students to visit the lab and serve as summer researchers. The PI and co-PI's close ties with the Harvard Museum of Natural History will allow for the development of public exhibits and events that showcase bone biology, genetics, and human evolution.

Researchers have discussed a number of evolutionary pressures, primarily related to the adoption of bipedalism, that are likely to have acted on pelvis and scapula morphology during hominin evolution. However, little is known about underlying genomic mechanisms that resulted in the observed changes in the shape and structure of these bones. This project will investigate portions of the genome that were previously identified as having potential activity and regulatory functions during embryonic pelvis and scapula development. The genomic sequences being specifically investigated overlap with regions of DNA that show signs of having been under positive selection in the human lineage. For each of these regulatory sequences, the researchers will test whether the human and chimpanzee versions of the sequence control gene activity, and whether there are differences in gene activity between the two species. This work will help to identify sequences likely to have been under selection during human evolution to produce the modern human pelvis and scapula.

"Electronic skins or 'e-skins' have recently emerged as a novel platform for electronics, taking on more important roles in health diagnostics, therapeutics, and monitoring. Stand-alone and self-sustained e-skins are essential to providing reliable, effective and sometimes life-saving functions. A stable power supply is the most critical factor in developing practical e-skins because the performance of their potential applications depends significantly on power availability. Thus, a realistic and accessible power source is urgently needed for a next-generation of smart, stand-alone, always-on e-skin systems. This is a challenge because human skin intimately integrated with e-skins is an extremely harsh environment for power generation. Skin is cool, dry, acidic and lacks potential energy sources. The overall objective of this proposal is to create the ability to generate an innovative, practical, and longstanding power from human sweat, which is one of the few available energy resources on the skin, by using the metabolisms of sweat-eating bacteria including human skin microorganisms or ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. Given that the total non-human microbial cells inhabiting in and on our bodies outnumber the human cells by at least a factor of 10, the direct use of the microbial cells to produce power is conceivable for e-skins. Findings will first be disseminated within the discipline through local and international conferences and journal publications; then they will be distributed through educational venues maximizing the project's reach and impact. The project will train graduate students and outcomes will be integrated into post-secondary courses and K-12 outreach activities.

This project will establish an innovative strategy to revolutionize power generation on human skin, delivering on-chip energy to the next generation of e-skin paradigm. The proposed sweat-powered batteries will be based on microbial fuel cells (MFCs), exploiting sweat-eating bacteria including human skin-inhabiting or ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms as a biocatalyst to transform the chemical energy of sweat into electrical power through bacterial metabolism. A thin, soft, flexible MFC will be pre-inoculated with selected electrogenic (or electron-producing) sweat-eating bacteria and will operate with human sweat, delivered by an integrated battery-free skin-interfaced system. The two-fold central hypothesis is that (i) some sweat-eating bacteria are capable of extracellular electron transfer and act as a biocatalyst in the microbial fuel cell device to produce electrical power, and (ii) those microorganisms can feed off the human sweat including ammonia and other organic substances for constant and sustaining bioelectricity generation. The immediate potential benefits of the proposed research are that (a) the project will develop a skin-mountable bacteria-powered battery system and establish fundamental knowledge critical to increase its performance, (b) the work will promote and accelerate the discovery and characterization of electrogenically active sweat-eating microorganisms, and (c) it will also create a novel skin-interfaced microfluidic system for sweat collection, delivery and storage to drive the integrated bacteria-powered battery. (d) Finally, this project will allow the microbial fuel cell technology to find more realizable applications as ""biopower-on-skin"" enables an entirely new area of energy harvesting research.

"Enzymes are biological catalysts that increase the speed of chemical reactions in the cell. Redirecting and repurposing enzymes to produce desirable novel chemical products is a challenge but could have significant industrial rewards. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Wei-chen Chang from North Carolina State University to repurpose specific iron-containing enzymes to speed-up a variety of chemical reactions that these proteins do not typically perform. Recent computational and mechanistic advances point to opportunities to use these enzymes to ""bio-synthesize"" compounds of industrial interest, and to understand the fundamental principles of how to control such reactions. Dr. Chang's studies use a ""substrate decoy"", in which the standard starting compound is replaced by a new reactant to change the type of chemistry catalyzed by the enzyme. For this project, the iron-containing enzymes are reprogramed to alter their functions.  Where they used to break down molecules, they now add chemical groups to create new compounds. The research plan is integrated with educational activities to inspire the next generation of students to pursue interdisciplinary research at the interface between chemistry and biology. The ""science express"" outreach activity uses a simple biochemical reaction that turns ordinary sugar into a blue dye (the ""blue genes for blue jeans"" hands-on experience) to show students how chemical biology impacts the world around them. These activities engage underrepresented K-12 students from diverse cultural, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds in rural areas of North Carolina. 

This research project aims to develop a substrate decoy approach to redirect the reactions catalyzed by mononuclear non-heme iron and 2-oxoglutarate dependent (Fe/2OG) while maintaining their catalytic efficiencies. Dr. Chang's goal is to explore the potential of utilizing this approach to biosynthesize industrially important molecules. The research objective is to redirect the reaction outcome of these enzymes from hydroxylation to nitrile group installation. A complementary objective is to elucidate, through various chemical probing and kinetic approaches, the mechanism by which Fe/2OG hydroxylases catalyze this non-native reaction. Dr. Chang's educational objectives include developing an undergraduate course in enzyme kinetics that integrates chemical and biochemical concepts through active learning methods. In addition, his group has developed an easy-to-understand enzyme catalyzed reaction (""blue genes for blue jeans"") as part of  the science express outreach program. This program, established in collaboration with local teachers, introduces middle school students to exciting research in chemical biology.

"Innovative research on the complex interaction of socio-economic and global environmental trends on biodiversity and ecosystem services is needed to help develop more informative scenarios for addressing environmental and human development challenges. To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research project, which is an international coalition between US scientists and those from four other nations with Arctic territories, seeks to evaluate freshwater biodiversity and food web dynamics in the circumpolar Arctic region and their value for people, communities, and the region. For this project, each country provides funds to support their own investigators and their part of the research. This project characterizes the current state of biodiversity along latitudinal gradients (north to south) in the Arctic and uses experiments and computer models to develop change scenarios in response to climate warming because Arctic warming can cause various physical environmental changes, such as permafrost thaw, which can result in changes in water quality, water temperature, food webs, and fish distributions. Shifts in food resources that might result could have large impacts on far north human populations (e.g., subsistence activities, commercial and recreational fisheries, etc.).  Through field studies, experiments, modeling, and forecasting, this project develops linkages between climate change, freshwater biodiversity, and consequences for ecosystem services in Arctic freshwaters, all of which have potential socio-economic impacts. Although a large body of literature exists on Arctic freshwater fishery economics, interactions between habitat conditions and the socio-economic consequences of human- and climate-induced changes in the productivity of Arctic lakes and rivers are poorly known. This study fills that gap. Broader impacts of the research include international collaboration between scientists in the US and Denmark/Greenland, Norway, Sweden, and Canada. They also include identifying shifts in biodiversity to assist countries in recognizing early warning signs of climate change-related ecological impacts in the Arctic; assessing economic implications for changes in Arctic biodiversity, something critical to managing regional resources and/or developing science-based policies and regulations; enabling circumpolar harmonization of sampling methods, data storage, and large-scale analysis to promote future circumpolar assessments of biodiversity change; and improving our knowledge and understanding of Arctic food security for native peoples and others in the region who depend on freshwater fisheries. The project also supports a PI from a gender underrepresented in the sciences at an institution in an EPSCoR state (i.e., Alaska), thereby broadening participation of underrepresented groups.

This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, the funded project will address knowledge gaps on the links between biodiversity and ecosystem services in Arctic lakes and rivers. The approach undertaken includes using physical/chemical climate change models to develop biodiversity change scenarios which incorporate multiple trophic levels and predict consequences of biodiversity scenarios to ecosystem services. Specific research objectives include: (1) evaluation of biodiversity and functional trait patterns in relation to environmental drivers and identify biodiversity hotspots in freshwater ecosystems (lakes and rivers) across latitudinal gradients in the Arctic; (2) insight into how direct and indirect drivers related to climate change impact the biodiversity and trait composition of Arctic aquatic food webs, and ultimately fish production; (3) quantifying uncertainty in biodiversity scenarios for Arctic freshwaters through empirical observations and experimental simulations; and (4) assessing the effects of nutrient enrichment and terrestrial land change on community structural and functional measures across latitudinal gradients in North America and Europe. Other approaches include use of bio-economic models to evaluate socio-economic trade-offs and potential shifts in ecosystem services in Arctic lakes and rivers associated with climate change, nutrient enrichment, and resource exploitation; developing assessment criteria that better quantify the ecological change in Arctic lakes and streams and provide strategies for the early detection of new and/or invasive species and that can feed into the development of biodiversity scenarios; and providing information and research results that better inform resource managers, regulators, and policy makers, as well as people who live in the Arctic and the global community concerned about the ongoing change in Arctic freshwater ecosystems.

"Motion in biological molecules, termed dynamics, is a requirement for many biological functions including enzyme catalysis, molecular recognition, protein-protein interactions, and substrate transport. While progress has been made to determine structures of membrane proteins in discrete conformations using X-ray crystallography, much less is known about the role of protein dynamics in function. The overall goal of this project is to develop novel experimental methods to sensitively measure functionally-relevant motions required of membrane proteins. This project will involve high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in research, which will further disseminate knowledge in the interdisciplinary fields of biophysical chemistry, chemical biology, biochemistry, and structural biology and develop STEM workforce for bio-industry and -economy. 

This research will focus on the development and application of oriented sample nuclear magnetic resonance (OS-NMR) experiments. These methods will be applied to three membrane protein transporters of varying size and complexity to establish the feasibility of the methods to reveal functionally important membrane protein dynamics. This project will develop methods to overcome the major challenges in studying membrane protein dynamics. Specifically, biophysical insight into conformational motions of membrane proteins involved in substrate transport and spectroscopic innovation in the development of solid-state NMR techniques to probe dynamics will be developed. to improve undergraduate curricula and scientific training across the 50+ member institutions. This project is supported by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Biological Sciences Directorate.

"NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

Bio-renewable polymers such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA) hold the promise to replace fossil-based thermoplastics such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET).  PLA has not replaced PET despite similar physical properties such as relatively high glass transition temperature Tg (60 to 70 degree Celsius) and slow crystallization kinetics.  Unlike PET, crystalline PLA are brittle at room temperature, making the material hardly usable.  Amorphous PLA is also brittle because of rapid physical aging that can take place in PLA.  To make the replacement competitive, which is of considerable economic benefit to the national prosperity and welfare, several scientific advances must be made.  First, a better understanding of mechanics of semicrystalline polymers must be achieved from a molecular viewpoint.  Second, a clearer relationship must be established between processing conditions and resulting mechanical properties of semicrystalline polymers.  The proposed research will investigate why crystallization does not enhance ductility for polymers with Tg above room temperature.  In particular, research will be conducted to evaluate the conjectures that (a) crystalline regions of such semicrystalline polymers are mechanically weaker than the non-crystalline regions and (b) fast crystallization is necessary is entrap chain entanglement and preserve (instead of deplete) chain networking.  Moreover, efforts will be made to establish the processing, structure and property relationships that will make PLA superbly tough and heat resistant.  Specifically, scientific principles will be identified to achieve crystallization while preserving chain uncrossability.


TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

Past studies of mechanics of semicrystalline polymers and ""flow-induced"" crystallization mainly focused on polymers whose glass transition temperature are below room temperature and crystallization kinetics are relatively fast, e.g., isotactic polypropylene and polyethylene.  The existing knowledge is thus not transferrable for class B semicrystalline polymers (with Tg above room temperature) such as PLA because mechanics of PLA at room temperature involves deformation of glassy amorphous regions that separate the crystalline regions.  For example, the well-known respective models of Peterlin and Flory-Yoon do not directly apply.  The much higher stress due to glassy polymer deformation raises the question of whether crystalline regions are structurally as strong as the amorphous regions.  Since chains do not topologically cross in the crystalline regions, the cohesion of crystalline regions cannot take advantage of strong covalent bonds and is thus limited.  The planned research will apply new knowledge in melt rheology and molecular mechanics of polymeric glasses, in combination with the mature characterization tools such as WAXS, SAXS and DSC to establish an insightful perspective that recognizes the need to explicitly describe and control the state of the amorphous phase in terms of the population of tie chains relative to dangling and free chains.  Moreover, in situ polarized optically microscopy will be employed to identify the locations (either inside spherulites, or within amorphous regions or at inter-spherulitic boundaries) where mechanical weakness resides, providing the needed information for a molecular model of mechanics of glassy semicrystalline polymers.  The proposed work will explore the unique effect of elastic pre-melt-deformation on polymer crystallization and resulting mechanical properties of PLA.  Here each stretched entanglement strand is expected to nucleate a nano-crystal that is free of chain folding and acts like rigid nano-fillers in close packing, linked by non-crystalline stretched chain networking.  Specifically, cold-crystallization of pre-melt-stretched PLA could result in crystalline yet optically clear samples that are not only superbly ductile but also have outstanding dimensional stability (e.g., zero shrinkage at 100 degrees Celsius).

"Primates engage in a complex array of behavioral strategies during social interactions. This doctoral dissertation project will study the relative importance of friendly and aggressive behaviors and the broader contexts in which these behaviors occur during male-female interactions. The project will contribute to our understanding of the distribution of reproductive behaviors observed across the Primate Order. This project will contribute to the training of an undergraduate student in hormonal analysis techniques in the laboratory. The project will also contribute to conservation education programs and classroom connections between research site locations and the home institution. 

Olive baboons provide a unique opportunity to test several hypotheses addressing the expression of coercive versus ""friendly"" interactions with respect to mating.  Because mating opportunities for males in this species are not strictly confined to the highest ranking individuals, both aggressive and friendly approaches occur, either by different males or even by the same males at different times, with different mates.  However, the conditions influencing the relevant male and female mating decisions generating these patterns are currently unclear. Systematic behavioral and hormonal data will be collected from wild olive baboons to test whether two recognized aggressive tactics are effective male strategies in either the long-term or the short-term. Correspondingly, this research will evaluate whether males obtain mating opportunities through the contrasting strategy of friendly interaction to females, either as part of a long-term strategy of positive social affiliation or as a short-term tactic. This project also will record female injuries and non-invasively measure stress hormones to evaluate the physiological response and potential costs to females of male strategies. This primate system provides a useful model for testing general principles of how these ostensibly antithetical strategy sets interact co-evolutionarily.

"The aim of this application is to construct and test the performance of a new generation of light-controlling materials called photonic hypercrystals (PHC).   This project builds upon the initial success of the investigators toward developing a new generation of fluorescence sensors with a detection limit and high dynamic range that have not been demonstrated in the past. They demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed application as evidenced by the outstanding performance of the proposed optical hybrid materials for the detection of a fluorescence signal with a very high degree of sensitivity. This project will potentially lead to a new class of highly novel sensors that can significantly improve the limit of detection of biomarkers of diseases. This can lead to the availability of highly sensitive, compact and low-cost fluorescence sensors for low-cost integrated diagnostic tools for biomedical and clinical applications.

Successful development of the proposed detection technique could have a significant impact on the development of highly sensitive detectors and instrumentation that could be used to develop novel biosensors and improve the performance an reduce the cost of existing bio-imaging and sensing platforms that detect and quantify fluorescence signals from biomolecules. The investigating team has outstanding records for teaching and training of students and research fellows in the fields of engineering, chemistry, biophotonics, biosensors, and nanotechnology.

"The aim of this project is to investigate packaging technologies for high frequency microelectronic circuits that will provide critical performance enhancements for next generation wireless systems. The approach is based on the use of low cost additive manufacturing or 3D printing processes, and will require advances in areas such as minimum feature size, reconfigurable electronic and mechanical structures, and millimeter-wave frequency circuit design.  The proposed approach of integrating the functionality needed to dynamically reconfigure a mm-wave system directly into the 3D-printed packaging is a new concept, since current packaging technologies predominantly serve only to provide environmental protection with no electronic purpose.  The new structural electronic packaging concept could therefore significantly disrupt the microelectronics packaging industry, as the functional packaging would provide the ability to perform actions such as changing operating frequencies and steering antenna beams in real-time.  The technology could impact important emerging applications such as 5G wireless, the internet of things and autonomous and connected vehicles.  It could also expand into fields such as wearable electronics, bio-electronic devices, and artificial organs. 

In addition to training graduate students the project will impact K-12 education by offering training opportunities to high school teachers and students.  Undergraduate students will also be involved through Research Experience for Undergraduates projects and multi-disciplinary Senior Capstone Design projects that are outlined by the industry partner. The principal investigators will continue to emphasize the participation of students from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented groups in engineering, and include a focus on the attainment of global perspectives and leadership skills as part of their training.



The technical goal of the project is to advance the state of the art in millimeter wave packaging technology by demonstrating new approaches for direct integration of low temperature on-package and on-chip structural electronics. The aim is to study concepts for reconfigurable packaging using dynamic structures that are fabricated using additive manufacturing. Specifically, the research will involve a hybrid, direct print additive manufacturing strategy that combines fused filament fabrication and micro-dispensing to form the package foundation in a conformal manner directly onto the microelectronic device or component. The critical electronic and mechanical features will be defined using pulsed picosecond laser machining with a targeted minimum feature size of 3-5 microns.  Performance goals include variable reactance devices with greater than 5:1 tuning in the upper Ka-band and interconnects with less than 0.7 dB/cm loss in the V-band.  

The proposed work has potential to make significant contributions in the area of functional electronic packaging, which may prove to be one of the most economically and technically important applications of direct print additive manufacturing. To date, no additive manufactured tunable devices have been demonstrated at millimeter wave frequencies. Furthermore, there are no existing packaging technologies that can combine the advantages of low temperature processing, conformal integration and dynamic real-time reconfigurability.  Finally, since the proposed approach is generic in nature it will be broadly applicable to a wide range of microwave/mm-wave communications and sensing systems. The project's industry partner brings expertise in microwave packaging and manufacturing and will play a critical role in steering the investigations to maximize future commercial impact.","Corvallis","Oregon State University","47.041","308459","EPMD-ElectrnPhoton&MagnDevices","1912679","tom.weller@oregonstate.edu","Thomas","Weller","04/22/2019","08/31/2018","08/31/2021","GOALI: Mm-Wave Reconfigurable Additive Manufactured Packaging Systems (RAMPS) using Pulsed Picosecond Laser Processing","BIO"
"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a new authentication solution that can identify users in a noncontact, non-volitional and secure way. Continuous authentication and noncontact operation are great values for an authentication system. However, many of the existing authentication methods do not provide those values. The proposed product is a new continuous authentication system by noncontact sensing cardiac waveform based on a smart radar technology. Compared with existing authentication systems, this technology improves the convenience and safeguard of many systems and facilities. This project could benefit many institutions or personnel that seek for a higher-level protection to prevent cyber attacks. Besides the benefits to a more secure world, the radar-based motion sensing technology to be investigated in this project could benefit other disciplines such as health/elderly care (examples include sleep monitoring and fall detection), disaster search and rescue (examples include finding victims buried under earthquake debris and tracking rescuers), and smart living applications (one example is remote gesture control of appliances). 

This I-Corps project aims to bring authentication solutions to a more secure and convenient level. Cardiac password, based on the human heart cardiac motion waveform, will work as a new noncontact biometric to authenticate users into computers and facilities. The technology is a high-sensitivity and high-accuracy motion sensor. Such a motion sensor can be embedded in an electronic system or device such as a computer, a smart meter, or an energy control system. It can also be installed at the entrance of a room/facility that requires authentication to access. The motion sensor continues to track the user?s heartbeat waveform to guarantee the system/device is used by the same authorized user or the room/facility is occupied by the same authorized person. The development of this technology combines researches in Electrical Engineering, Bioengineering, Computer Science, and Cyber Security. It involves multiple research areas including radio-frequency (RF) system design, bio-signal processing, pattern recognition, biometrics, and computer security. The result of this project will provide a secure, trustworthy, and noncontact continuous authentication approach based on invariant and non-volitional features of human cardiac motion.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to increase the clinical utilization of cancer chemotherapy drugs by reducing toxic side effects and improving the therapeutic index. The key technology is based on the controlled release of chemo-drugs in response to tumor acidosis. The initial product is an acid-sensitive prodrug of Doxorubicin (Dox). Dox is a prominent chemo-drug commonly used in the treatment of breast, bladder, and other cancers (including the childhood cancers Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma). The current global annual market for Dox is ~$800M (~$400M in the US). Treatments of solid tumors that are likely to be acidic account for ~60-70% of Dox applications in the clinic. The Dox global market is projected to reach $1.38B by 2024. This pH-sensitive prodrug of Dox may be considered an improved version of Dox for treating acidic solid tumors. Also, this technology could be expanded to other chemo-drugs outside of the anthracycline class. Furthermore, acidic microenvironments are found not only in cancerous tumors, but also in other disease states, such as sites of inflammation and the ischemic myocardium during heart attacks, which represent other potential targets of the pH-sensitive prodrug technology in the future.

This I-Corps project aims to develop a technology for improving the safety profile of chemo-drugs by suppressing drug release at healthy tissues, while preferentially releasing drugs at tumor sites. The targeted drug release would be triggered by tumor acidosis. Due to rapid growth, many cancerous tumors have extracellular pH (pHe) in the range of 6.5-6.9, compared with pHe of 7.2-7.4 in healthy tissues. Tumor acidosis can be considered as a universal biomarker of the cancer microenvironment and correlates with poor prognosis (i.e., more acidic tumors are usually found in more aggressive cancers). To turn tumor acidosis against cancer, this team developed ultra-acid-sensitive, small molecule prodrugs to selectively release Dox in response to acidic tumor pHe. The critical challenge of developing an ultra-sensitive pH biosensor that can distinguish between pHe 7.4 and 6.7 has been met from the basic science side by using an acid-sensitive linker. Preliminary data indicate that these prodrugs can release ~ 4-fold more Dox at pH 6.7 vs. 7.4 in cell culture settings.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project rests in the advanced biomedical treatments that can be delivered using recombinant protein-based materials. In current surgical procedures, hydrogel adhesives are limited to applications as sealants in conjunction with sutures. In addition to the unmatched strength of sutures, problems such as poor bonding on wet surfaces, low strength, and high swelling limit the reproducibility, applicability, and adoption of currently available adhesives and commercialization of other advanced tissue regenerative materials. The goal is to bring to market an adhesive platform that will overcome those limitations and introduce new functionalities. Furthermore, the ability to use protein engineering to improve material functionality will broaden the target market segments. The availability of an effective hydrogel adhesive platform will empower patients and health care providers with a next-generation tool that can replace sutures to achieve cosmetically and functionally improved healing, decrease complications, and increase patient comfort.

This I-Corps project is focused on the development of a protein-based adhesive that can bond to soft tissues. An advantage of the bioinspired recombinant protein in our core technology is that it can resist washout once applied because it deswells (does not absorb water) at body temperature. Once cured, the resulting hydrogel is flexible and can maintain its properties unlike other hydrogel adhesives which absorb water and swell. Genetic engineering also allows direct integration of functional peptide sequences. During development and testing, the project will establish the design principles that will enable the creation of next-generation adhesives with high bonding, flexibility, and bio-interactive properties.

"The Great Unconformity (GU) represents one of the largest gaps of time in the rock record. Since it is followed by the Cambrian Radiation, one of life's most significant increases in biodiversity and complexity, it has long been thought that these phenomena are linked. Geoscientists have proposed that the GU was caused by large-scale erosion of Earth's crust. As rocks weathered and dissolved, an element critical to life, phosphorous, was released and carried to the ocean by rivers. The increase in phosphorous is proposed to have spurred photosynthesis among cyanobacteria, which then increased the oxygen content of the ocean and atmosphere. This oxygenation was perhaps the fuse that led to the Cambrian Radiation since complex life requires oxygen. Despite the GU's potential role in one of life's most important transformations, very little is known about when and where it occurred. Determining when the GU developed and the size of the last erosion event that lead to its formation are critical for identifying viable mechanisms for life and environmental change during this pivotal interval of Earth history. This research project is making use of advances in zircon and titanite (U-Th)/He methods to decipher GU development. Results are directly testing hypotheses that relate continental erosion to oxygenation and the explosion of life. The project is also advancing scientific and technological understanding through the training of undergraduate and graduate students and K-12 teachers. 

It has been proposed that the erosion below the Great Unconformity occurred as the result of supercontinental breakup, Snowball Earth glaciation, or global eustasy, and may have delivered bio-limiting nutrients to the ocean that fueled the Cambrian Radiation. However, the timing, proposed global synchroneity, and magnitude of the Great Unconformity have not been previously tested or constrained. Recent advances in (U-Th)/He thermochronology allow access to the thermal histories required to unravel the history of this iconic feature. This project will acquire zircon and titanite (U-Th)/He data for samples along two transects across two different cratonic margins. Study sites will be targeted to fully exploit Neoproterozoic and Cambrian geologic constraints, which will be vital for narrowing the range of viable thermal histories to enable discrimination between GU formation models. The results will dramatically improve constraints on the Neoproterozoic cooling history of each margin, which will be used to test competing models for GU development and significance.

"The objective of this project is to understand the principles of dynamics and control that intrinsically couple legged robots with bioinspired robotic tails to achieve agile animal-like locomotion. This research hypothesizes that spatial robotic tails can augment the performance of legged robots by enhancing their stability and maneuverability. The research will establish a firm analytical foundation that enables: (a) systematic investigation and analysis of the effects of robotic tails on the stability of highly-agile maneuvers of legged robots, and (b) development of  control algorithms for agile legged locomotion with bioinspired robotic tails. The theoretical innovations will be reduced to practice by incorporating spatial robotic tails on legged robot testbeds. This research will enable to build legged robots with agility and stability that are seen in animals to effectively and rapidly navigate in unstructured, hazardous and complex environments which will lead to faster search and rescue or exploration of dangerous environments. Additional deliverables of this project include dissemination of research results, engineering education and research experiences for students and science teachers, new engineering curriculums, and outreach and diversity initiatives for students, teachers, and under-represented minorities.

The overarching goal of this project is to establish a strong foundation for a paradigm shift from traditional control algorithms that only address legged locomotion without bioinspired robotic tails to resilient control algorithms that intrinsically couple legged robots with bioinspired robotic tails to achieve agile and dexterous animal-like locomotion. The research draws upon robotics, controls, and hybrid systems theory to fuse observations from nature in the transformation of state-of-the-art methods for the control of agile legged locomotion. The research will create innovations in analysis by studying the effect of tails on the stability of legged locomotion and innovations in control by creating a systematic framework to design robust control algorithms that coordinate the robotic tail motion with that of the quadruped by enhancing its dexterity, agility, and maneuverability. The research has broad societal impacts by enabling the next generation of agile autonomous legged robots to efficiently overcome obstacles in natural environments and to effectively assist, or stand in for, humans in dangerous situations such as in disaster areas. The integrated education plan involves creation of new courses as well as STEM-based outreach initiative for K-12 students, teachers, and under-represented minorities.

"The Plant Synthetic Biology (SynBio) Satellite Meeting, convened by the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB), aims to raise community consciousness of what SynBio is and what it can do in key areas of economic and intellectual pursuit. These include crop productivity, specialty chemicals, biosensors, and microbe-plant interactions. The conference is structured to maximize engagement and information sharing among an estimated 185 participants at all career stages from academic, industry, and government research teams and promote public sector?industry exchanges. The impact will be especially great on early-career plant scientists, all of whom will spend their careers in the SynBio era and many of whom will pursue careers in SynBio research and development. Accordingly, up to 34 early career researchers will be supported by this award, with a special emphasis on broadening participation. The Plant SynBio Satellite Meeting will leverage its association with the annual American Society of Plant Biology 2019 meeting, which typically attracts more than 1,300 scientists from 40 countries and which will be held at the same site (San Jose, CA) just prior in August 2019. The two conferences will be integrated via a shared plenary symposium on SynBio, further extending the impact of this award to the broader plant science community that ASPB serves.

Synthetic biology (SynBio) is a transformative combination of DNA technologies, engineering principles, and computational tools that makes it possible to design new life processes and to repurpose existing, natural ones to generate new knowledge, devices, and products. SynBio is already transforming plant science in fields ranging from biosynthetic pathways to the interactions between plants and microorganisms. As both a conceptual and an operational revolution, SynBio promises to be even more creatively disruptive than the molecular biology revolution that began in the 1970s. This is because SynBio (i) opens access to the vast ""design space"" that plants and other organisms have that is not represented in the natural world, and (ii) industrializes biology by augmenting step-by-step work with computationally guided, automated, and standardized engineering procedures. SynBio-based companies are burgeoning, as are the career pathways that they create; however, plant scientists at all career stages are only just starting to appreciate the extent to which SynBio will impact training needs and the design and execution of experiments. The Plant SynBio Satellite Meeting, convened by the American Society of Plant Biologists, aims to raise community consciousness of what SynBio is and what it can do in key areas of economic and intellectual pursuit.

"The rise and prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria have significantly increased the costs of treatment and, more seriously, death rates. Thus, it is imperative that as these antibiotic-resistant bacteria evolve, so must the medicines that are utilized to treat them. In this research project, Professor Shaowei Chen from the University of California Santa Cruz proposes to use composite materials based on graphene oxide and metal/metal oxide nanoparticles as next-generation, low-cost, potent antimicrobial reagents. This is to take advantage of their synergistic interactions in the bactericidal actions, where the antimicrobial activity of the composites is markedly enhanced as compared to those of the individual components. The success of the proposed research will help establish a unique platform for the development of high-performance antimicrobial reagents. Additionally, the proposed research will offer an educational framework within which student researchers will acquire many complex skills by undertaking an interdisciplinary effort. Also, part of the research activities will be closely integrated with several outreach programs targeting minority, women, and disadvantaged undergraduate students and qualified high-school students. The students will acquire skills that are unattainable in a conventional classroom setting. The hands-on experience and intense training in laboratory research are anticipated to instill a strong sense of self-confidence and good work ethics in their future careers as part of the STEM workforce.


The central goal of the proposed research is to advance our understanding of the mechanistic origin of graphene-based nanocomposites in antimicrobial applications and to develop a fundamental framework for the rational design and engineering of nanocomposites based on metal (oxide) nanoparticles and graphene derivatives as low-cost, high-efficiency antimicrobial reagents. There are three specific tasks: (a) design and engineering of graphene nanosheets, where the graphene structures (e.g., size, morphology, surface functionalization) will be systematically manipulated and the impacts on the antimicrobial activity will be carefully examined, (b) preparation of functional nanocomposites based on metal (oxide) nanoparticles deposited on graphene nanosheets, where the nanocomposite photo reactivity will be exploited as a powerful variable in the further manipulation and optimization of the antimicrobial activity, and (c) establishment of a structure-activity correlation by combining (nano)materials and molecular biology approaches, with a focus on unravelling the fundamental mechanisms in the bactericidal process. The proposed research is built upon recent progress in Professor Chen's laboratory where apparent antimicrobial activity was observed with transition-metal nanoparticles as well as graphene quantum dots, with the production of reactive oxygen species identified as the leading mechanism of action. A wide range of experimental tools will be employed in the research activities. For materials characterizations, these include transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance, UV-visible, Raman, infrared, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Using Escherichia coli as the illustrating example, the antimicrobial activity towards the inhibition of bacterial growth will be quantitatively assessed by UV-visible spectroscopic and fluorescence microscopic measurements, and the biochemical origins will be examined by RNA sequencing, within the context of reactive oxygen species generation and bacteria cell membrane damages. A direct, intimate correlation between these two efforts is anticipated to shed light on the mechanisms of action and lead to the establishment of a fundamental framework within which rational design and engineering of graphene-based nanocomposites can be achieved for optimal antimicrobial performance.

"This award supports the 45th Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference (NEBEC) which will be hosted by the Rutgers University Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Rutgers University Livingston Campus Student Center, 84 Joyce Kilmer Avenue, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, on March 27 - 29, 2019. The funds requested will primarily be used to subsidize undergraduate and graduate student registration fees and cover website and publication costs associated with the conference venue.

INTELLECTUAL MERIT:

The intellectual merit of the 45th NEBEC is to showcase biomedical engineering research and education programs while stimulating inter-university collaborations within the Northeast U.S. Because of the large number of Biomedical Engineering programs within the Northeast United States and their proximity to a high concentration of leading medical centers as well as pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and medical device industries the NEBEC offers numerous opportunities for student, faculty, clinical, and industrial interactions in order to strengthen research, educational, clinical, and  industrial impacts of biomedical engineering. We wish to present the conference through a lens focused on specific initiatives and centers at Rutgers University as well as offering industrial opportunities due to Rutgers? unique location at the center of the NJ ""cure corridor"" being within 50 miles of numerous fortune 500 health care companies. 

BROADER IMPACTS:

The broader impacts of this support are to promote student participation in the NEBEC to allow interaction opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students enrolled in bioengineering/biomedical engineering programs in the Northeastern U.S. We hope to promote opportunities for undergraduates to present their research to a diverse audience. In particular, efforts will be made to recruit early career investigators, female investigators, and investigators from underrepresented groups to participate in the conference. We will ensure that woman and minorities have opportunities to present and attend the meeting. By subsidizing registration costs, we hope to reduce registration fees for all participants compared to the fees charged from other NEBEC venues in recent years. This will help us recruit young investigators and students from underrepresented groups to broaden the participation of a diverse group of investigators who may otherwise not be able to attending the workshop. This conference will provide a venue for biomedical engineering programs located in the Northeast U.S. to present research, while promoting the exchange of ideas and technologies in order to expand research and educational collaborations as well as providing interaction with representatives from the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and medical device industries.

"This doctoral dissertation project will use comparative and biocultural approaches to better understand how body phenotypes are understood in the US cultural context, and how these cultural understandings may contribute to biological disparities among adolescents. The investigators will measure allostatic load (a measure of low-level chronic stress) in two groups of adolescents to assess biological impacts of psychosocial stress from perceived weight stigma in various epidemiological contexts. The work will address complex relationships among phenotypic norms, social stigma, and co-morbidities of obesity in a vulnerable section of the US population, at a time when there is a high prevalence of obesity, perceived weight stigma, and weight discrimination. Research findings will be shared with study participants as well as curriculum specialists to develop new learning modules. The project supports graduate training for a female, first-generation college student. 

This research employs a mixed-methods, sequential explanatory strategy, using questionnaires, biomarkers, and ethnographic interviews to compare two populations varying in prevalence of obesity: Lawrence County, Indiana (38%) and Monroe County, Indiana (22%). The project is framed around the concept of biological normalcy, which refers to the ways in which human societies develop understandings of what a ""normal"" human body is - normal referring to normative ideas about what bodies ""should"" be as well as statistical distributions of different phenotypic traits. The researchers use this concept to address: 1) how cultural beliefs about what constitutes a ""normal"" or healthy body are related to statistical biological norms (i.e. obesity prevalence) within a population, and 2) how these normative beliefs influence the statistical distribution of biological traits (i.e. allostatic load) in a population. It is hypothesized that variation in obesity prevalence observed between the two field sites in Indiana will be associated with differences in perceived weight stigma, with those reporting higher perceived stigma also having higher allostatic load, and that this relationship will be moderated by several social and behavioral factors and coping strategies.

"Understanding and engineering brain function has been identified as a grand scientific challenge in recognition of its potential to revolutionize a number of fields including computing and medicine. Fully-implantable Bidirectional Brain Computer Interfaces (BBCI) are the focus of this project. These are electronic systems capable of recording, processing and stimulating neural activity, and they play a foundational role in enabling better understanding of the brain. Implantable BBCIs will enable neuro-scientists to explore brain function in unprecedented detail, and help realize neuro-prosthetic devices capable of restoring mobility, vision and brain function among the disabled. However, critical technological barriers facing BBCIs are hindering progress in neuroscience. Existing BBCI architectures do not scale well, in terms of power or area, to support ever-increasing numbers of recording and stimulation channels needed for finer examination and control of brain function. Furthermore, neural stimulation produces artifacts - electrical disturbances in the brain - that hamper the ability to perform neural recording. Finally, the desired level of computational performance required to perform neural signal processing and data-communication to external devices consumes power in excess of thermal limits of implantable devices. The technologies resulting from this project will be translated into a fully implantable, bio-compatible and versatile closed-loop neuroscience platform that overcomes these existing challenges. Collaborations with neuroscientists, the medical-device industry, and fabrication partners, to be pursued during this project, are critical to the realization of this goal. The resulting platform will be made available to the broader neuroscience community to enable experiments at unprecedented levels of scale and scope, accelerating progress toward understanding the brain. Both graduate and underrepresented minority students will be involved in the project.

This award addresses the critical BBCI barriers of power, area, performance and recording quality by investigating and devising cross-cutting technologies that span digital/mixed-signal circuit design, architecture, systems theory and system integration. Exploiting domain-specific structure across every level of abstraction, from algorithm partitioning down to package- and circuit-design is central to this project. The effort is organized into three threads: 1) Development of novel, computationally-enhanced neural interfaces to achieve desired levels of efficiency and scalability; 2) Exploration of domain-correspondence to Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communication systems through low-energy computing, which will allow systems capable of rejecting artifacts and allowing recording to be focused to a targeted set of neurons; and 3) Leveraging an understanding of neural signal processing algorithms and preliminary results in ultra-low power computing to devise domain specific architectures that meet BBCI processing requirements under severe power limitations.

"Understanding the response of the ocean to global warming, including changes in the renewal of ocean waters from the surface (ventilation), is important for future climate predictions. Oxygen distributions in the ocean thermocline are an effective way to infer changes in ventilation because physical processes (ventilation and circulation) that supply oxygen are primarily responsible for changes in interior oxygen concentrations. Reduced ventilation, as expected under global warming conditions, is signified by a reduction in oxygen inventories. However, natural variability such as decadal oscillations can obscure climatic trends; long-term data records are needed to fully distinguish between trends and cycles. This study will use available data, including Argo profiling floats, ship-based surveys, and satellite-derived surface densities, collected in the North Pacific over the past decades. This study is unique in that it examines physical mechanisms of ocean interior oxygen variability using a data-only approach, overcoming biases and misrepresentations possible with ocean models and reanalysis products. The team combines the expertise of two researchers in satellite oceanography and ocean hydrography respectively. Undergraduate summer interns will be incorporated into the project and trained in these fields with the goal of fostering geoscience education. Both PIs are also active in graduate student advising and outreach activities in public schools and at the Pacific Science Center. Results from this research will be included into such outreach, raising public awareness about the changing ocean environment. Monitoring ocean ventilation is important because a reduction in ventilation reduces the ocean ability to take up anthropogenic CO2 with important feedbacks to the global climate system. Declining North Pacific O2 concentrations may become stressors for marine organisms if threshold values are reached. The data methods used are transferrable to other ocean basins as well.

This project will focus on the North Pacific thermocline, where some of the world ocean's largest oxygen variations have been observed. These variations, described as bidecadal cycles on top of a small declining trend, are strongest on subsurface isopycnals that outcrop into the mixed layer the northwestern North Pacific. It has been hypothesized that changes in the isopycnal outcrop positions and area, including complete cessation of outcrop, are the cause for the subsurface oxygen changes observed downstream. Argo data will be combined with satellite sea surface data and ocean interior data from continued repeat hydrography sections, time series stations, and also emerging bio-Argo profiling floats (with O2 sensors) to examine records of North Pacific surface density over the past ~40 years, in combination with water transfer into the thermocline and ocean interior O2 variability. The study will focus on seasonal to decadal variability and long-term trends. Specific objectives are (1) computing sea surface density and isopycnal outcrop area variability in the northwestern North Pacific, (2) estimating annual subduction rates and O2 fluxes from the outcrops into the thermocline, and (3) linking subduction in the northwestern North Pacific to downstream oxygen variability in the northeast. It is hypothesized that surface densities in the northwestern North Pacific exhibit decadal cycles similar to subsurface oxygen (as well as a declining trend) and that oxygen variations in the eastern North Pacific interior (thermocline) are correlated with surface density/subduction rate variations in the northwestern North Pacific with a few year lag.

This doctoral dissertation project will study astrocytes, a type of metabolically important brain cell, to determine their contribution to the unique metabolism of the human brain. This work will further our understanding of evolved metabolic and neurological differences among primates, while providing insight into an understudied, but critical cell type of the brain at the cellular and genetic levels. This project will support the research of a first-generation female college and graduate student, as well as the development of public and K-12 science communication efforts largely focused on demystifying the genome and understanding the societal implications of readily accessible genomic data. 

Previous research has consistently shown enrichment of metabolic function in genes differentially expressed between the brains of several primate species. This proposal will investigate the evolution of gene expression and function in astrocytes, to understand the extent to which this cell type contributes to the unique metabolism of the human brain. The investigators will use established, non-invasive cell culture methods to grow and develop astrocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells of both humans and chimpanzees. These astrocytes will be assayed for differences in gene expression and traits important for metabolic function, such as glucose uptake into the cell.

"Humans have lightly built skeletons compared to both non-human primates and extinct human ancestors. Most research on human skeletal variation has focused on comparing bone structure among geographically, genetically, and behaviorally diverse human groups. In order to understand the influence of behavior and mobility on human bone structure, this doctoral dissertation project will quantify skeletal variation among human groups that are genetically and geographically similar, but behaviorally distinct. This research integrates archaeological evidence of human behavior and microcomputed tomography data to investigate bone structure as an intersection between behavior and biology. Low bone mass related health complications are a prominent expense within the U.S. healthcare system; this project will provide insights into the factors that may contribute to the risk of low bone mass related health issues from an anthropological perspective. The project will also contribute to the development educator workshops for using publicly available 3D image data for classroom-based research projects. 

Recent work has found that human groups with higher levels of activity tend to have more robust cortical and trabecular bone structure compared to groups with relatively lower activity levels. However, much of this research has relied on comparing geographically and genetically distinct human groups. This project investigates the relationship between cortical and trabecular bone structural variation across several post-cranial elements within and between human groups that are genetically and geographically similar, but behaviorally distinct in order to test whether the relationship between behavior and bone structure is maintained, or if other factors such as diet, genetic background, and environment play a larger role in forming adult skeletal phenotype than previously considered. Microcomputed tomography scan data of the humerus, cervical vertebra, femur, tibia, talus, and calcaneus will be collected. Cortical and trabecular bone structural variation will be quantified and compared between groups with different subsistence strategies including foragers, horticulturalists, and intensive agriculturalists. Additionally, the amount of variation in cortical and trabecular bone will be investigated within and between both individuals and skeletal elements in order to understand how different levels of bone structural organization respond to variation in subsistence strategy and mechanical loading.

"Humans vary in body size and proportions, and the underlying drivers of this variation are not fully understood. Differences in body form can be adaptive for certain environments, such as assisting in thermoregulation of the body through the dissipation or retention of heat, but can also be related to factors such as genetic drift and population history.  This doctoral dissertation research will examine human skeletal variation to understand the impact of various environmental factors on human body form across a wide geographical range.  The project will help to elucidate how environmental factors may have complex, differential effects in males versus females and across different parts of the skeleton. Skeletal data from the project will be compiled into a freely accessible online database. The addition of data for groups and regions of the world that are currently underrepresented in biological and forensic studies will increase understanding of human variation and global diversity.  The project will also foster international research collaborations and student training at the undergraduate and graduate levels. 

Asia has diverse climates, high population densities, and a long history of human habitation.  Using a multidisciplinary methodological approach, this study of Asian populations will meaningfully quantify proportional differences resulting from environmental variables in a way not possible with previous ecogeographic methods.  Standard skeletal measurements and landmarks will be collected to allow for comparisons across geographic regions as well as further examination of variation in the size and shape of the face, cranial vault, and birth canal between the sexes and populations. The analyses will account for the potential influence of nonadaptive forces such as drift and migration on body form by pairing skeletal measurements with appropriately matched genetic data and local weather station information for statistical analysis.  Linear mixed effects models testing for evidence of adaptation due to environmental factors will contain both head and body data of male and female individuals from each population.  Differences in the size and shape of the pelvis between the sexes along with population differences in pelvic morphology will be evaluated using Procrustes fit and principal components analyses as well as size and shape dimorphism indices.

"Language is a trait that sets humans apart from all other species, and researchers are interested in understanding how, when, and why complex language evolved in hominins. This doctoral dissertation project will use a non-human model to understand neuro-genetic changes that correlate with increased social learning and flexibility of vocal behavior. These data will be compared with human and chimpanzee genomic data to identify potential shared evolutionary mechanisms in the evolution of birdsong and human language. By illuminating the molecular mechanisms of auditory perception that support learning of a more flexible vocal behavior in the model system, the research may shed light on our understanding of normal functionality and disorders of human speech. The project will also include public and K-12 science outreach activities in the San Francisco Bay Area.

This project will empirically investigate the genetic and evolutionary processes that correlate with increased flexibility of vocal learning and behavior in the White-Backed Munia (WBM)/Bengalese Finch (BF) songbird system. The researchers will then investigate potentially analogous genetic and functional pathways involved in the evolution of flexible human vocal learning capacities with respect to those of other primates. Specific aims of the project include: (i) an investigation of the evolutionary forces underlying the changes in vocal behavior in BF relative to WBM utilizing whole-genome sequencing of individuals within the two bird strains and subsequent scans for signatures of positive or relaxed selection, thus allowing identification of candidate genes modified in this transition; (ii) an analysis of genetically regulated differences in neurological function correlated with differences in the flexibility of adult vocal production between BF and WBM, by comparing measures of gene expression for whole transcriptomes from main birdsong-related brain areas of BF and WBM adult males exposed to unfamiliar conspecific song; and (iii) a comparison of the birdsong data to neuroanatomical and genomic data provided by studies of human divergence from closely related primates (e.g. chimpanzee) to identify possible evolutionary parallelisms.","Los Angeles","University of California-Los Angeles","47.075","28104","Bio Anthro DDRI","1913821","sawhite@ucla.edu","Stephanie","White","03/08/2019","03/01/2019","07/31/2020","Doctoral Dissertation Research: A model system for understanding the evolution of human language","BIO"
"Modern humans have dispersed and settled nearly every region on the planet. The complex timing, movements, and interactions of populations, cultures, and technology in the past are an important part of our human story. This doctoral dissertation project combines genetic and geochemical analyses of human skeletal material from the Chelechol ra Orrak site in Palau, western Micronesia, to investigate prehistoric colonization of an island setting during one of the most widespread and rapid dispersals in human history. Despite this being the last major geographical region to be colonized by humans, information regarding the timing, direction, and origins of settlement in many respects remains unclear. This research will also make broader contributions to local, national, and global communities through undergraduate training and mentorship at the University of Oregon; community involvement and outreach through public talks and the distribution of comics about aDNA in archaeology in Palau; and the implementation of a learning module that teaches the scientific method, archaeological fieldwork, and genetic techniques to underrepresented elementary and middle school students in Oregon.

The investigators will analyze human ancient DNA (aDNA) and geochemical mobility data for Micronesia and provide critical baseline information for future isotopic and genetic research in the region. The objective of this research is to investigate the origins of prehistoric Palauans on a regional scale and subsequent local human mobility within the archipelago following settlement. While linguistic, computer modeling, and biodistance studies have resulted in hypotheses identifying broad general regions of Micronesian population origins, numerous questions regarding the relationship of early Micronesians to other regional populations, and a more specific area of origin still remain. In generating aDNA data for western Micronesia, this project will place early Palauans in a regional framework to examine broader scale genetic relationships. Examination of mobility via strontium (87Sr/ 86Sr) and lead (206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb) isotope analysis from human remains--in conjunction with biological and geological samples taken from locations across the archipelago--will help to identify where individuals buried at Chelechol ra Orrak may have been residing during their lifetime and shed light on inter-island mobility during the earliest phases of settlement in Palau.

"Nanofabrication is the process of making functional structures with arbitrary patterns having nanoscale dimensions. Nanofabrication has been widely implemented commercially for improving microelectronic devices and information technology. However, the limitations of conventional lithography techniques in terms of resolution, capital and operational costs, and limited flexibility in terms of materials that can be patterned and fabricated have motivated the development of unconventional fabrication methods. Scanning probe lithography is one of these promising new fabrication methods, and it uses a scanning sharp probe to produce with nanoscale precision modifications on the surface of a material. This award supports fundamental research for the development of a scanning probe lithography method based on hot probes, which are used to thermo-chemically change the properties of a material at the nanoscale. This technology, called thermochemical nanolithography, has a broad range of applications, in particular to fabricate nanostructures in graphene, conductive polymers nanowires, DNA and protein nano-arrays. The research work is geared toward answering questions that can facilitate the wide scale use of thermochemical nanolithography and providing students with a unique interdisciplinary training that includes developing knowledge in materials science, spectroscopy, nano- and micro-fabrication, and surface science techniques. This will enable the team to augment the community's understanding of nanoscale processes and potentially provide inexpensive and robust tools to decrease the cost of entry into nanolithographic patterning. 

Thermochemical nanolithography is a versatile atomic force microscopy based technique that can be used to fabricate nanostructures and nanoribbons of graphene-like materials via local thermal reduction of chemically modified graphene. Thermochemical nanolithography uses thermal probes to locally heat the surface of a material to produce a variety of nano-scale chemical reactions, which can be controlled in terms of spatial resolution and extent of chemical conversion, so that complex chemical gradients can be obtained. For applications in the next generation of electronic, sensor and energy nano-devices based on graphene-like materials, this project aims to address the following issues: (i) fabrication of defect-free graphene nanoribbons with control over size, length and positioning (registry) on arbitrary substrates; and (ii) nanoscale control of the chemistry of graphene and other materials nanostructures. The research team will use experiments, finite elements calculations and density functional theory simulations for understanding and controlling the nanoscale thermo-chemical modification of graphene-based materials to fabricate graphene nanoribbons of high quality with excellent control over positioning and size. Furthermore, this project aims at developing parallel (up to 100 probes) patterning using novel concepts of temperature control and software, with the goal of writing and then reading more than 1 million 10-nm pixels in 1 second.","New York","New York University","47.041","27325","NANOMANUFACTURING","1914540","er124@nyu.edu","Elisa","Riedo","02/22/2019","09/01/2018","07/31/2021","Collaborative Research: Controlling the Chemistry at the Nanoscale: Parallelization, Robustness and Registration","BIO"

"Old Dominion University is awarded an Early Faculty Career Development grant to support Dr Shuiwang Ji in research leading to a better understanding of the brain. The brain is an enormously complex system, and the analysis of brain data is thus an equally enormous challenge. Human brains contain billions of neurons and trillions of synapses (junctions); and each of them is unique in their basic biochemistry, functions, and dynamics. The brain is also a multi-level system organized across different spatial scales, ranging from genes, synapses, and cells to circuits, brain regions, and systems. Today, brain science is experiencing rapid changes and is expected to achieve major advances in the near future. Recent technological innovations are enabling scientists to capture the gene expression patterns, connectivity, and neuronal activities at increasing speed and resolution. This is generating a deluge of data that capture the brain activities at different levels of organization. To attack the central challenges of analyzing these new data, this project will develop a class of efficient, integrative, multidimensional, predictive, and correlative techniques and use them to analyze large-scale, high-resolution, and multi-modality sets of brain data. Specifically, this project will develop analytics tools to predict the cellular-resolution, brain-wide connectome (""wiring diagram"") from genetic transcriptional profiles. This analysis will elucidate the information pathway from genes to connectivity and ultimately, to function. This project will also integrate other brain dimensions by performing multidimensional network correlative analytics. In addition, this project will address the relationship between gene expression, cell types, and brain structures. The success of this project will be a new class of efficient, robust analytics methods that are flexible enough to be adapted for integrating, modeling, and mining current and future brain data.

The results of this project will have an immediate and strong impact on multiple disciplines, including brain data analytics and computational neuroscience, biological image informatics, and big data analytics. A future long term goal is to uncover basic underlying differences between normal and impaired brain functions. The unified treatment of brain data analytics will be readily transformable into new courses for training next-generation computational biologists. The multidisciplinary nature of this project provides unique opportunities for integrating its components into existing curricula. Brain science has been shown to be a valuable resource for inspiring scientific interests in K-12 students. Components of the project will be integrated into an existing high-school student internship program, thereby inspiring future science students. Underrepresented students will be especially encouraged to participate throughout the project. The results of this project will be disseminated in the form of peer-reviewed publications, open-source software, tutorials, seminars, and workshops.

"Old World monkeys are the most geographically widespread and ecologically diverse group of living primates, with a wide range of diets made possible by the combination of their gut adaptations and the unique shape of their molar teeth. Old World monkeys acquired ""bilophodont"" molars, with cusps united into two pairs of wedges, soon after diverging from a last common ancestor with apes. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the functional significance of this shift in molar form, drawing upon, and contributing to, a framework that considers how dental wear alters the shape and function of teeth throughout an organism's life. This project will also provide opportunities for public outreach and undergraduate research engagement, including students traditionally underrepresented in STEM careers. The large number of 3D scans generated by this project will be made publicly available through MorphoSource, where they can have further use for scientific and educational purposes.  

Primates, like all herbivorous mammals, face selective pressures to maintain function of their permanent teeth in the face of tooth wear. This project will use 3D dental topographic methods to measure the shearing and crushing/grinding potential of molars at varying wear stages in a sample of extant and fossil catarrhines (i.e., Old World monkeys, apes, and humans). First, the investigators will establish a baseline of how extant catarrhine molars are altered by macroscopic wear and use phylogenetic comparative methods to test whether diet or tooth morphology has a greater influence on maintenance of shearing function. Second, these methods will be applied to measure the shearing and crushing/grinding potential from molars of Oligocene and Miocene catarrhines. While extant Old World monkeys have two fully developed lophs on their molars, early members of this clade exhibit partial loph development in some molars. The investigators will test whether these early stages of bilophodonty gave stem cercopithecoids greater persistence of certain tooth functions relative to their non-cercopithecoid catarrhine relatives. Ultimately, this project will contribute to our understanding of the functional origins underlying a key adaptation that contributes to the dietary flexibility and evolutionary success of Old World monkeys.

"One of the most important features of any image-forming eye is correct focusing, which relies on the precise spacing between the lens and retina. Substantial data show how this coordination is established in vertebrates. However, some of the most basic questions concerning how eye components are coordinated in invertebrates remain unanswered. This project primarily focuses on Sunburst Diving Beetles as a particularly valuable system for analyzing these key factors because they can be manipulated on the molecular level and their larvae have extremely sophisticated eyes, the focus of which can be quantified. To test for the generality of the identified mechanisms, and in specific instances dissect them further, synergistic experiments are performed on the genetically powerful fly model Drosophila melanogaster. The eyes of both animals are evaluated using a micro-ophthalmoscope that has recently been developed in the host laboratory. Preliminary findings suggest that both beetle and fly eyes are able to develop astonishingly precise focus in the absence of visual feedback. If confirmed, invertebrate eyes could become an important general model for precisely tuned organ development that is easily assessable and can be manipulated at the molecular-genetic level. The execution of this project involves training of many undergraduate and graduate students, who will also actively participate in outreach activities. In addition, the project involves the development of synergistic teaching modules.

The principal eyes of diving beetle larvae are sophisticated visual organs that rapidly grow to ~130% of their original size at the second to third instar transition. It is likely that such eye elongation involves changes in osmotic pressure. The lens also needs to be reformed, which takes considerably longer (~8 h) and likely involves some of the 10 lens proteins that have been identified through a previous collaboration of the PI and Co-PI. Aim 1 of the project uses a unique live imaging technique (the micro-ophthalmoscope) that allows direct visualization of the retina and measurement of the refractive states (focusing into infinity or being near- or far-sighted) of very small invertebrate eyes, including those of the diving beetle larvae and individual D. melanogaster ommatidia. This technique is used in combination with traditional optical methods and behavioral tests in diving beetles to test if visual input is necessary for proper eye growth in these animals. Aim 2 uses physical manipulations and pharmacology to evaluate the contribution of osmotic pressure to eye-tube growth and aim 3 uses in situ hybridization, immunostaining, and RNAi knockdowns of the identified lens proteins to investigate how the complex Thermonectus lenses change focal lengths. Targeted parallel experiments on D. melanogaster explore the generality of specific findings. It is expected that this integrative approach will provide some of the first data to address the long overdue question of how eye growth is coordinated in arthropods.

"Porous materials are ubiquitous: soils and rocks support habitat and store energy, cementitious materials are the building blocks of infrastructure,  and our body is made of porous tissues. Strikingly, in all of these media, the absence of solid matter, called the porous space, triggers processes that lead to instabilities of the solid structure and/or of the fluid flow. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) site award, titled ""Mechanics of Porous Media across Scales - Research Experience in Paris"" (MPMS Paris), supports U.S. students for immersion in cutting-edge poromechanics research laboratories in Paris, France. The award aims to expose Georgia Tech students to poromechanics research applied to civil, environmental and biomechanical engineering, to immerse them in the academic culture of leading European institutions based in Paris, and to inspire them in the pursuit of a scientific career to create resistant, sustainable and safe porous materials in response to infrastructure, energy and health demands. IRES participants will do a 10-week research internship in one of several host laboratories at leading partners institutions in Paris under the supervision of dual mentors from Georgia Tech and the MPMS Paris partner. The project includes experienced teams who collaborated on a prior IRES award and teams new to the collaboration. Pre- and post- internship activities will be organized in partnership with Georgia Tech international education programs and the Science and Technology Department at the Consulate General of France in Atlanta. IRES participants will take ownership of a research project in elite engineering laboratories, acquire language skills and have longer exposure to history, technology and society than in a regular curriculum. The integration of activities for faculty and undergraduate and graduate students is expected to sustain long-term collaborations between groups focusing on experimental, theoretical and numerical research in poromechanics.

Technical description. A multi-scale approach is needed to gain a fundamental understanding of the complex phenomena that occur in porous media subjected to mechanical and environmental solicitations, such as hysteretic flow and adsorption, fracture initiation and propagation, in-pore crystallization and damage development, resin infiltration and tissue restoration. The IRES site will gather a community of scientists including world experts in theoretical poro-mechanics and thermodynamics, from Navier and IFSTTAR at Ecole des Ponts Paris Tech (a top European program in applied mathematics and mechanics), MSSMat at Centrale-Supelec (a top European program in mechanical and electrical engineering) and LMS at Ecole Polytechnique (the most selective engineering school in France). Host laboratories are equipped with unique experimental, imaging and material processing facilities and are located on the campuses of French ""Grandes Ecoles"", which are elite engineering programs. Fundamental research in the physics and mechanics of porous materials will combine cutting-edge simulation tools with advanced experimental and imaging techniques to establish multi-scale models that can capture coupled bio-thermo-hydro-chemo-mechanical processes and predict the sustainability and durability of engineered systems. Teams of dual mentors will foster long-term collaborations by working with several cohorts of IRES students on a core research topic. The IRES program will also support travel expenses for mentors to further enhance the student experience and collaborative research activities. The project will support the successful collaborations established through a prior IRES award led by the PI, expand the program to a larger and more diverse group of scholars and ensure a bilateral flow of scholars between Georgia Tech and Paris.

"Scalp hair in the absence of body hair is a uniquely human trait, whose evolutionary significance is not well understood. This doctoral dissertation project will develop a digital tool for the quantitative measurement of hair fiber morphology, to investigate the underlying genetic architecture of hair morphology across human groups, and experimentally test the function of scalp hair as a barrier to solar heat gain. The methods developed as part of this project will advance our understanding of human adaptive traits and also inform forensic and dermatological research. Data collected for this project will increase the representation of understudied groups in research. This project will provide valuable research opportunities for undergraduates from groups underrepresented in STEM research fields and will generate materials for teaching about human biological diversity in a non-racial paradigm.

Human hair morphology varies on a continuous spectrum from straight to tightly curled; however, research in genetics, dermatology, and forensics incudes a range of descriptors that can be qualitative (e.g. wavy, frizzy) and racial (e.g. 'Caucasian hair,' 'African-type hair'). By developing a method to quantify hair morphology and studying the genetic variation in a diverse group of African Americans, this study leverages genetic admixture as a means of elucidating genotypes underlying hair morphology across human groups. The experimental work in this project will test the hypothesis that human scalp hair morphology evolved in early Homo as a protective mechanism against heat gain from solar radiation. This project will additionally carry out a series of tests of selection on candidate loci (previously associated with hair morphology or hair follicle development) to test whether there is evidence of selection in hair-related genes that would support a thermoregulatory explanation for the evolution of human scalp hair.

The REVAMP REU site focuses on the critical national need of manufacturing, and more specifically, advanced manufacturing research and technology, which will play a crucial role in positioning the U.S. manufacturing sector as a continued world leader.  By leveraging the Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute (GTMI)'s world-class facilities, diverse technical expertise, and inspiring interdisciplinary research environment, the REU activities will give students the opportunity to improve knowledge in the critically important advanced manufacturing technology topic areas noted above. Training in research methodology, performance of scientific manufacturing research, tours of manufacturing facilities, and completion of technical seminars provided by GTMI faculty will significantly expand each student's manufacturing knowledge base, preparing them for future careers in advanced manufacturing. The research experience will be enhanced by entrepreneurship training including specialized customer discovery experiential learning, seminars focused on the fundamentals of evidenced-based entrepreneurship, and case studies presented by startup company leaders offered by the GT Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI2). Through entrepreneurship training, students will also have a transformative opportunity to develop critical leadership skills for transitioning basic research discoveries into commercially-viable innovations. NSF I-Corps South programs and veteran-faculty mentorship opportunities provided by the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) will be incorporated into this renewal REVAMP REU site program.   
 
A unique feature of this REU site is its focus on training of veterans and underrepresented minority students. To accomplish this goal, GTMI will target its recruiting efforts on the top universities/colleges in the nation for veteran enrollment and several HBCU's and institutions with high female enrollment. This REU site will combine advanced manufacturing research training with the principles of entrepreneurship, encouraging students to become leaders in innovation. This will help to fill the current void between fundamental research and technology commercialization in the U.S. It is expected that the site will serve as a new educational model for educating veterans and 21st century engineers in STEM and entrepreneurship that can be replicated by other colleges and universities throughout the nation. In addition, the REU site will support and encourage strong participation by women and underrepresented minorities in manufacturing-related STEM fields.

"This award supports international research experiences for U.S. undergraduate students from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) at the University of Victoria (UVic) in Canada in interdisciplinary research representing the fields of bioengineering and neuroscience. The project engages primarily Hispanic engineering students at UTEP, a majority Hispanic 4-year, public institution. Reciprocal visits to UTEP by UVic students will be supported with Canadian funds.  UTEP students will be afforded professional development and educational opportunities in cutting-edge research.  Specifically, the project engages the synergism of stem cell biology with advanced 3-dimensional biomaterial technology to manufacture tissue from stem cells. Generating patient-specific ""artificial"" tissue allows the researchers to control the rate of growth and differentiation of stem cells.  This research is significant in paving the way for modeling disease and for future drug development.  

Working together, the interdisciplinary team aims to identify unique approaches of targeting differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells [iPSCs] into neural phenotypes by utilizing advanced materials and processing. Specifically, the UTEP team has expertise in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) culture and 3D bioprinting, and UVic has expertise in culturing neuronal differentiation of human iPSC on fibrin-based scaffolds. The research focus is the application of microfluidic-based 3D bioprinting for coprinting of human iPSCs together with biomaterial scaffolds to generate bio-composites of the desired architecture with high fidelity. Bioprinting iPSCs with advanced biomaterials and scaffolds bears the promise to develop 3D tissues, ideally including encapsulated cells and facilitating their proliferation, and targeted differentiation. The project enables addressing critical questions in the field: 1) How can advanced materials and their unique designs facilitate stem cell culture and promote their differentiation? 2) How can 3D bioprinting be applied as an advanced manufacturing technique to mimic the complex environment for regulating growth and differentiation of stem cells? 3) Does the differentiated progeny of cells cultured atop micro-textured scaffolds exhibit enhanced functionality and phenotype, compared with controls? Thus, the scientific goal is to better understand the role of growth factors and micro-environmental niche and cues released from biomaterial scaffolds in the regulation of adult human iPSC differentiation into neural phenotypes. It is widely known that distractive biomaterial scaffolds that incorporate patterned structures and specific compartments of growth factors can more intricately guide stem cell development. Achieving this goal enables the ability to address fundamental neurobiological questions about neuronal growth, differentiation, which is essential for designing treatments for nervous system disorders or traumatic brain injury.

"This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the relationship between physiology and behavior when humans are exposed to novel, challenging environments. The project will draw upon core bodies of research on biological plasticity and adaptation, energy allocation and expenditure, and social cooperation. This research will facilitate new insights on how humans acclimate to extreme cold and high altitude demands, which will broadly inform research on human capacities to respond to the diverse range of ecological stressors found throughout the world. This study will help train a woman of color at the University of Notre Dame for her PhD and will also help in the training of undergraduate and junior graduate students in the Hormones, Health, & Human Behavior Lab, of which ~80% of lab members are women and underrepresented minority students. In conjunction with the National Outdoor Leadership School, the investigator has created a project website that both students and the public can easily access for preliminary findings and updates on the study. The research team has also heavily engaged in public outreach, including presentations for elementary and middle school classes, public lectures to local communities, and promoting scientific inquiry and sharing research through popular science articles, podcasts, and social media venues like Twitter.

This project aims to help understand how humans biologically and behaviorally acclimate to novel and challenging ecologies, specifically via the relationships between energetic/metabolic physiology, neuroendocrine systems, and social dynamics. The investigator will study individuals participating in ~90 day expeditions through the American Rockies as a part of the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). In such environments (e.g. high altitude or cold), ecological and psychological stressors impose intensive demands on human physiology, including metabolic and psychobiological functioning. The research will address larger discussions about (i) biological variation, plasticity, and adaptation in challenging ecologies, (ii) life history- and ecological-based perspectives on energetic allocation and expenditure, and (iii) the evolution and function of prosociality, cooperation, and collective action. Recognizing the relationship and nuances between physiology and behavior may give critical insight into the success of human global expansion and settlement, with implications for human health and well-being as well as future exploration, and habitation of increasingly changing and unique ecologies.

"This doctoral dissertation study will explore an important aspect of teeth and their role in dietary ecology, by testing the ability of tooth enamel to resist fracture and wear from forces applied during chewing. Tooth enamel from different primate species will be imaged and mechanically tested using methods from materials science engineering to better understand the relationship between the internal structure of teeth and their performance. The results of this study will illustrate the mechanisms that allow teeth to chew tough and hard foods, which may inform research to develop stronger replacements for worn and broken teeth, as well as research to better reconstruct the diet of extinct humans and animals. The study will support graduate student training and the development of undergraduate laboratory coursework that emphasizes the use of concepts from dental biology and anthropology in engineering applications.	

This study will address how the form of enamel contributes to its function in resisting tooth failure. At micro- and nanometer scales, enamel is formed out of many small crystals that are bundled together in complex patterns. These patterns are thought to help teeth resist wear by aligning crystals in a direction where they are strongest in response to abrasion. Additionally, a highly complex pattern of interwoven crystals is believed to help prevent cracks from moving through enamel and leading to a chipped or cracked tooth. This study combines ion beam microscopy to image micro- and nanometer structures of enamel in fine detail, and indentation methods from material science engineering to determine how enamel structures respond when forces are applied. To understand how these structures function in human teeth, the variation in their properties will be compared with those of other closely related species. For this reason, the analytical sample includes teeth from humans and a range of non-human primates including chimpanzees and baboons. Ultimately, this study will strengthen the inferences that can be made when determining diet from fossils in our evolutionary past, and help to illustrate how and why teeth break.

Part 1
Nanofibers exhibit unique properties that have stimulated a massive effort in nanofibers research to address key challenges in high performance filtration, battery separators, wound healing, composites, blood vessel and tissue engineering, electrochemical sensing, smart textiles, drug delivery, and catalysis. Some recent examples include: Dermtreat's nanofibrous Rivelin patch for innovative treatment of mucosal diseases and DuPont's nanofiber-based EnergainT battery separator, which boosts up to 30% power of Li-ion batteries, just to name a few. The global market for nanofibers is expected to reach ~$2 billion by 2021, but its growth potential is hindered by limited ability of sizeable production of nanofibrous materials with predictable complex, macroscopic architectures, and desirable properties.
Undergraduate and graduate trainees with diverse backgrounds from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of South Alabama, Troy University, and University of Montevallo will tackle the challenges in the nanofiber science and technology through intense real-life research on fabrication of nanofibers by an uncommon, high-yield alternating-current electrospinning (ACES) process. ACES unveils several new physical phenomena and features that significantly reduce or eliminate many disadvantages of traditional techniques while greatly increasing the productivity and simplifying material handling. All IRES trainees will gain critical international research, industry, and cultural sensitivity experiences expanding beyond each participant?s institution through the collaborative work at a number of high-profile labs and related industries in three European countries, joint presentations/publications, social activities, and interactions with diverse international student population at TUL, UT-Lodz and Aalto. The goals of this project are to accelerate innovation and increase outcomes in the nanofiber materials domain and to develop future leaders and experts capable of operating at a high level of advanced research and competence in global collaboration.

At least 27 students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), University of South Alabama, Troy University, and University of Montevallo will engage in the hands-on pre-trip training at UAB and a 8 week-long cutting-edge research at the forefront of nanofibers science and technology at those premier European institutions, followed by the long-term post trip research and outcomes dissemination activities. 
IRES trainees will fabricate nanofibers using a high-yield Alternating Current Electrospinning (ACES) process, which unveils several physical phenomena that significantly reduce or eliminate major disadvantages of traditional DC-techniques, while greatly increasing the productivity. Trainees will apply the fabricated materials to biomedical scaffolds and smart fabrics at TUL, heterogeneous catalysts at UT-Lodz, and novel electrochemical sensors at Aalto. Students will have broad options to immerse in quickly evolving research ecosystem at foreign sites that stimulates breakthroughs and discoveries, as well as multiple opportunities to develop passion for exploration and innovation, and courage to influence and excel. Through the team and individual research projects, professional and soft skills-building exercises, this IRES will: (i) advance the theory and practice of ACES, (ii) help to design a better equipment for sizeable production of nanofiber materials and structures, (iii) develop new nanofiber-based materials and structures with desired properties and performance in controlled and predictable manner, and (iv) foster the training of  globally-engaged experts, visionaries, leaders, and team builders for the fast-growing nanofibers research and manufacturing domain, and for the relevant fields.
IRES trainees will regularly reach out to the public, other college and school kids, e.g., through a new annual IRES student-led Nanomaterials Workshop at TUL, research immersion high school workshop at UAB, and broadcasts by JagTV, USA's student-run TV station. All participants will mutually benefit through a growing network of advanced research and training facilities. This project will enable, in a long-term perspective, a broader synergistic coupling between domestic and international research groups by bringing new collaborators and catalyzing the continuation of international student exchanges.

"Vitamin D is vital to the function of several organs and tissues, with decreased vitamin D levels hypothesized to be a contributing factor in several disease processes. Populations in higher latitudes are more likely to have vitamin D deficiencies due to lack of sun exposure; however, recent research indicates that vitamin D deficiency has become a global phenomenon, even in countries near the equator, with women often experiencing more severe deficiency. This doctoral dissertation project applies a biocultural perspective on vitamin D production from infancy through young adulthood to investigate how societal practices and norms create and dictate the physical environments that individuals experience. By using a longitudinal data set, the study delves deeper into the possible factors that contribute to vitamin D deficiency in both men and women, and for societies undergoing urbanization. The project not only addresses the complex interplay of human biology and culture, but also has the potential to inform public health efforts to understand and address vitamin D deficiency.  

Biological anthropology has elaborated the tradeoffs between the need for vitamin D production and the need to avoid damage from the harmful effects of exposure to ultraviolet rays, but unanswered questions remain regarding how vitamin D is regulated and why some individuals are at risk for vitamin D deficiency.  The primary focus has been on sun exposure, but other aspects of the current environment, and aspects of the environment experienced early in life, may be equally important.  This study will use longitudinal data collected from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey in the Philippines to assess the effects of rapid urbanization and socioeconomic change on vitamin D production in young adulthood.  A range of environmental factors early in development, and in adulthood, will be tested as predictors of circulating vitamin D.  Furthermore, DNA methylation - an epigenetic process that is associated with gene expression - will be measured at sites in genes associated with vitamin D production.  DNA methylation is a plausible mechanism through which environments during development can regulate genome activity in adulthood, and the study will investigate the association between environments in childhood, DNA methylation of vitamin D genes, and vitamin D production in adulthood. The use of a biocultural anthropological approach allows for an exploration of how lived experience affects vitamin D production and well-being over the life course.

"Approximately 20 percent of global annual crop loss is attributable to insect infestation, creating major economic concerns about decreases in the food supply for a growing global population expected to exceed nine billion by 2050. Sorghum, one of the world's most important monocot crops grown for food, feed, and fuel, suffers severe yield losses due to attack by phloem-feeding insects, including aphids. However, little is known about the extent of genetic variation that contributes to sorghum resistance or susceptibility to these insects. The goal of this project is to elucidate previously unknown sorghum resistance mechanisms to aphids in order to help design novel targets for pest control and reduce dependence on costly and harmful insecticides. The knowledge gained from this project identifies key genes, signaling networks, pathways, and/or regulatory mechanisms that underlie sorghum resistance to phloem-feeding insect pests. The broader impacts of the project include an innovative and comprehensive outreach/education program to understand plant resistance to insects by involving middle and secondary school teachers and middle school and undergraduate students, particularly those from underserved and underrepresented groups, as they explore solutions to real-world situations involving concepts of plant resistance to insect pests. In addition, this project will provide multidisciplinary training to undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral research associates in the areas of plant biology, genomics, and entomology.

The defense signaling networks underlying monocot crop resistance to aphids remain largely unknown, and this is especially true for sorghum. This project fills an important gap in current research by utilizing genomic resources to gain insight into the underlying genetic networks and phenotypic traits that contribute to sorghum resistance to aphids. Natural variation in a panel of sorghum inbred lines is used to elucidate the novel sources of sorghum resistance to sugarcane aphids. A combination of molecular, biochemical, and electrophysiological approaches enable a better understanding of the genetic basis of sorghum resistance to aphids. Four objectives are proposed: 1) characterization of SCA feeding behavior and the early physiological defense responses involved in sorghum resistance to aphids, 2) discovery of novel genes and the underlying transcriptional networks that contribute to sorghum resistance/susceptibility to SCA, 3) determination of key defense metabolites in sorghum resistance/susceptibility to SCA, and 4) development  and delivery of outreach and educational programs in plant insect interactions and plant defense for middle and secondary school teachers and middle students. The results from this project provide improved insight into how endogenous defenses and manipulation of defense signaling networks contribute to the development of more efficient and durable insect pest-resistant varieties of sorghum. Although the project focuses on sorghum, the knowledge gained has broader applications to other significant cereal crops such as maize, wheat, rice and barley.

This project is jointly funded by the Division of  Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS) in the Biological Sciences Directorate (BIO) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

"Calcium ions are essential signals to regulate communication and function in cells, which are the basic biological units of living systems. Within the central nervous system, physiological levels of calcium play an important role in neural activity and in transporting signals across neuronal networks. In contrast, highly elevated levels of calcium ions are associated with dysfunctional communication and can lead to the degeneration of the neuronal network. Recently, it has been demonstrated that magnetic nanoparticles can be used to mechanically open calcium channels allowing calcium ions to enter neurons through the cell membrane. How this intentional, force-mediated influx of calcium ions interacts with structures inside neurons and how it spreads within a neuronal network is highly important for understanding force-mediated brain cell communication and degenerative diseases. This award will fund a research program that links nanomaterials to neurobiological systems and aims to capture and to quantify calcium signal transport in experimentally grown, controlled neuronal networks. Both graduate and undergraduate students involved in the project will benefit from an enhanced research infrastructure combining nanotools and neuroengineering. These nanotools will also become available to a broader research community interested in analyzing changes in communication patterns during degeneration or stem cell development. Finally, the project will involve the creation of an interdisciplinary bio micro-electro-mechanical system (BioMEMS) course to advance the STEM workforce in Montana, and science communication summer workshops for students specifically interested in transforming engineering data into visual arts. 

Stimulation through nanomagnetic forces is a tool that operates magnetic nanoparticles within magnetic fields to impose a mechanical force on associated objects. Within a biological context, this project considers brain cells that express mechanically sensitive ion channels and receptors as the target for nanomagnetic stimulation. Applying nanomagnetic forces to the membrane of neural networks in vitro has been shown to trigger an influx of calcium ions, recently. How the force stimulation relates to other neurophysiological events, however, remains unknown. In particular, the integration of subcellular biomechanics with innovative neuronal cell screening platforms has not been used in combination with nanomagnetic force stimulation, previously. This knowledge gap currently limits the broader experimental applicability of nanomagnetic stimulation. Hence, this project addresses current limitations of nanomagnetic force stimulation by unraveling how neuron-to-neuron communication is impacted by force-mediated intracellular changes in calcium signaling. The proposed work will systematically analyze how fast this force-mediated calcium influx in neuronal networks occurs, and how the architecture of a neuronal network impacts the spatial transport of evoked signals. Calcium fluorometry will be employed in combination with electrophysiology to assess the spatiotemporal aspects of subcellular calcium stimulation in rodent primary neurons. Furthermore, this project develops highly parallelized arrays of cell nano-manipulation and assessment tools with low-resolution live-cell calcium imaging to map calcium signal propagation across neuronal cultures. Research results from this proposal will pave the way to future use of mechanical stimulation as a precise neurophysiological tool. Based on this knowledge, the project will develop design guidelines for future neuro-therapeutics using magnetic nanoparticle-mediated force stimulation.

"In order to improve understanding of an organ system, researchers often build physical/benchtop models that mimic the system sufficiently to reproduce, observe, and measure functions that are challenging to evaluate in the body. Though many such models of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems have been developed to simulate the motions of the beating heart and breathing, none faithfully replicates the mechanics of the diaphragm or faithfully mimics the three-dimensional twisting and compressive motion of the heart. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to build a lifelike, benchtop model that recreates the motion and function of the heart and the diaphragm using a combination of advanced robotic techniques and actual organic tissue.  This model will provide insights into physiology, pathology and interdependence of the systems and serve as an innovative and effective teaching tool for educating students on cardiovascular and respiratory physiology and pathology. It will also serve as an anatomically and physiologically accurate testbed for implantable cardiac devices, representing a vast improvement over existing models and ultimately reducing the requirement for testing devices in animal models. Finally, it will act as an impactful visualization tool for educating and engaging the broader community (for example in museums and in Children's hospitals). The PI will use this demonstration and teaching model as one of many approaches in a multi-pronged initiative to recruit, train and retain a new generation of women in academic scientific positions.


The goal of this project is to shift the paradigm of benchtop simulators from one where the respiratory and cardiovascular systems are independently simulated with synthetic phantoms or ex vivo tissue and motion is passively driven by fluid or external components to one where functional dynamic tissue is recreated using programmable biomimetic soft active materials.  Synthetic soft robotic muscular simulators for the diaphragm and heart muscle (myocardium) will be combined with ex vivo biological tissue (entire lungs and intracardiac structures respectively) to create ""hybrid biorobots"" that will enable accurate representation of lung and heart motion, while preserving key anatomical structures, thus maintaining form while recapitulating function. Clinically derived motion data of the diaphragm and heart will be used to develop algorithms to ""program"" the design of fiber reinforced biomimetic soft actuators. Subsequently, these active elements will be embedded in anthropomorphic matrices to mimic the form and function of the diaphragm and heart. Diaphragm-driven breathing mechanics and  cardiovascular hemodynamics will be recreated using pressurized anatomical chambers and mock circulatory loops.  The Research Plan is organized under three objectives.  The FIRST OBJECTIVE is to create a modular, active biorobotic diaphragm that can be integrated into an in vitro testbed that can be used simulate physiological and pathological biomechanics and generate ex vivo lung ventilation. The in vitro testbed will integrate pressurized chambers separated by an interchangeable diaphragm mimic to replicate the physiologic pressures of the thoracic and abdominal cavities.  Soft-robotic actuators will be programmed to mimic the desired diaphragm motion trajectory as computationally extracted from clinical MRI data. This will be the first functional soft robotic diaphragm mimic to replicate a variety of clinically derived diaphragm motions.  The SECOND OBJECTIVE is to create a cardiovascular testbed including a biorobotic heart that recreates cardiac wall motion and generates pressure changes to simulate hemodynamic conditions. A novel hybrid fabrication process will be used to preserve the intracardiac structures (endothelial lining, septum, valves, papillary muscles and chordae tendinae) of the heart using ex vivo tissue (porcine hearts) or high-resolution 3D printing. The active heart muscle will be replaced with a synthetic soft material containing fiber-reinforced actuators oriented in desired configurations. The biorobotic heart will be integrated with a partially compliant vascular flow loop to simulate hemodynamics.  This will be the first realization of a soft biorobotic heart that integrates organic intracardiac tissue with soft robotic myocardium and the first cardiac simulator where cardiovascular hemodynamics are driven completely by a myocardial substitute that is capable of replicating twist as well as compression, which is critically important in the performance assessment of medical implants.  The THIRD OBJECTIVE is to integrate components to make a cardiorespiratory platform and to demonstrate its utility in a model to simulate respiratory and hemodynamic biomechanics of Fontan patients. Physical cavities of the respiratory simulator will be designed based on Fontan patients' CT and MRI data.  Based on previous work, a controller that actuates physiological pressure profiles during a breathing cycle in a simulated chest cavity of a Fontan patient with total cavopulmonary bypass will be developed.  The respiratory simulator will then be combined with a partially compliant vascular flow loop to simulate venous pressure and flow patterns of Fontan patients. This will be the first combined cardiorespiratory simulator using a soft robotic heart and diaphragm and the first platform to recreate the Fontan physiology including both trans-diaphragmatic pressures and abdominal pressure.

"Marine robots can be used to accurately map and track marine life, leading to a better interpretation of variability and migration patterns that are important to fisheries managers in marine protected areas (MPAs).  Principles of engineering and oceanography can be used to maximize the impact of a network of marine robots, but because fisheries managers, oceanographers, and roboticists have different perspectives and knowledge bases, it can be difficult to take advantage of cutting-edge research in each field without significant effort to translate among the groups. Researchers will develop a computational interface that translates human-specified missions of fisheries managers into multi-level planning for a fleet of marine robots to monitor fish populations in a dynamic coastal ocean environment. The system will be designed with input from fisheries managers through a series of workshops, and will be field-tested at Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary, a federally-managed MPA off the coast of Georgia.  The research will lead to more accurate and effective ways to monitor fish populations in MPAs, as well as breakthroughs in key areas of artificial intelligence and autonomous systems. Many of the results will be applicable to other smart and autonomous systems in challenging environments.  In addition, the project will train graduate students and broaden undergraduate education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and offer a number of outreach activities, including working with the University of Georgia Marine Extension service to develop a summer camp for middle and high school students.

The project is focused on developing an intelligent physical system (IPS) that consists of a heterogeneous fleet of marine robots, cooperatively tracking fish movement and surveying the habitat with minimum request for human intervention. The IPS will translate the human-specified missions of fisheries managers into goal-driven task designs for each robot, and automatically generate executable plans for the networked mobile sensing agents. The system will autonomously and persistently collect in-situ measurements and acoustic detections of fish species while maintaining multi-scale data streams and constructing multiple spatial-temporal maps reflecting the conditions of the ecosystem. The research aims to discover the hotspots (e.g., spatial locations with sustained congregations of fish), as well as illuminate more information about how and when fish move among these hotspots. This goal is quite challenging due to a number of gaps between project needs and the state-of-art autonomy research. Researchers will address the challenges through new developments that accomplish three main tasks: (1) Developing the goal-driven marine autonomy for fish habitat survey, (2) realizing the goal-driven autonomy on physical systems, and (3) evaluating the developed framework through real-life field work, experiments, and data analysis.

"Minerals which are formed through the involvement of organisms (biominerals) and are preserved in the geological record can be used to shed light on the evolution of life on Earth. Moreover, such minerals can be used to reconstruct environmental conditions in the environments of formation. Dolomite is a ubiquitous mineral in the geological record and an important petroleum reservoir rock. Accordingly, dolomites can be incredible archives for reconstructing and understanding environmental changes throughout Earth's history and specifically shed light on the evolution of organisms on Earth and in other planets.  However, dolomites occur in many different sedimentary and/or diagenetic settings and it is hard to precisely determine formation mechanisms using currently available mineralogical or geochemical tools. This limits and complicates the utility of this mineral for geobiology, petroleum research, and low temperature geochemical studies. Being able to unequivocally identify dolomites that form in association with living organisms (microbial-dolomites) in the geological record would eliminate some of these complexities and allow for more straightforward interpretation of deposition environments. In this study the investigator hypothesizes that the involvement of microorganisms in the formation of dolomites induces unique signatures that could be used as ""bio-markers"" and enable identification of microbial-dolomites in the geological record. The investigator will test this hypothesis using microbial-dolomite samples that were precipitated under controlled laboratory experiments at different temperatures and growth conditions and microbial-dolomite samples forming at present in a marine-lagoon and a lake setting. 

The major goal of this proposed research is to investigate the utility of Ca, Mg and Sr stable isotopes in dolomite to shed light on the mechanisms of dolomite formation. To address this goal the research will first analyze a suite of dolomite samples (and the solutions from which they precipitated experimentally) to identify unique signatures. This will be complimented by the analysis of dolomite that formed recently (or is currently forming) in modern lagoon and lake environments along with other associated minerals, exopolymeric substances and precipitation fluids. Ancient dolomites across the two major time intervals when oxygen levels increased at the Earth surface will also be analyzed. Together with petrographic and stratigraphic information the geochemical fingerprinting will enable identification of microbial-dolomite. Dissolved samples and chromatographically separated solutions will be analyzed for major-and trace element compositions using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Stable isotope compositions will be determined by multi collector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) and thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). Solid samples will be analyzed petrography and visualization (microscopy, SEM, TEM), mineralogy (XRD) for C and O isotope (IRMS) data will also be collected. The research team has the needed experience and instrumentation.

"Nearly one-sixth of the world's population suffer from neurological diseases, including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, autism, Alzheimer's disease, depression, etc., and their life qualities are severely compromised. In order to effectively treat these brain-related diseases with minimal side effects, we need to fully understand the functional networks in the brain. However, this endeavor has been largely hindered by the engineering challenges of making deep brain interface devices that match the functional complexity and mechanical compliance of the brain. There remains an urgent need to create a multifunctional device that can seamlessly interface with the brain without causing significant damage. This research program proposes to develop novel neural interface devices which are highly flexible, biocompatible, scalable, and clinically translatable, with multisite multifunctional capabilities. The developed toolset will also be utilized to address some of the key challenges in biological applications, with a focus on the seizure, tumor, and the visual system. To achieve these goals, the proposed research program will build upon the leading edge research across multiple fields, including nanomaterials, optics, electronics, surface chemistry, microfabrication, and neuroscience, and aims to significantly advance the fundamental understanding in these fields. The proposed research offers many potential benefits to society, including the possibility of improving the lives of patients with neurological disorders. The research will be highly integrated with multilevel educational components towards K12 students and teachers, undergraduate, and graduate students, with a focus on underrepresented student groups. Examples include the Kindergarten-to-College program targeting fifth graders from more than ten title I schools across Virginia, and the Computers and Technology at Virginia Tech program targeting high school girls from Virginia and out of state. The PI will also actively participate in the National Science Foundation's Revolutionizing Engineering Departments grant for transforming undergraduate education in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Virginia Tech. 
The objective of the proposed research program is to address a key challenge in developing bio-friendly and multifunctional neural interfaces utilizing a non-conventional fiber drawing and patterning platform. The methods to be employed include nanomaterials processing and modeling, multimaterial multifunctional fiber fabrication and patterning, electrochemical characterization and circuit modeling, optical characterization and modeling, and in vitro and in vivo neural stimulation and recording. This project will enable flexible and biocompatible, nanoelectrodes-integrated, bidirectional, and multisite three-dimensional neural interfaces. It can facilitate the understanding of complex brain functions as well as the treatment of neurological diseases. The specific goals of this program are (1) Scalable fabrication of nano-integrated electrodes. Fundamental understanding of the material properties and charge transfer will be obtained through thorough characterization as well as mechanical and electrical modeling. (2) Multifunctional integration combined with modeling to understand the material and structural limitations. (3) In vitro and in vivo neural stimulation and recording for neuroscience applications including seizure, tumor treatment, and visual circuitry. The intellectual merit of this proposed research includes the understanding of (1) how nanomaterials interface with neurons at the cellular or subcellular level; (2) the fundamental limitations to neural electrode sizes and optical channels; (3) nanomaterials properties under extreme physical conditions. Besides, this developed toolset will enable significant new insights into various neuroscience applications through interdisciplinary research across multiple fields.

"Non-technical: 
Diabetes is a disorder in glucose regulation, and is characterized by increase in blood glucose. Globally, an estimated 422 million people had diabetes. In the United States, about 8.3% of the population currently has diabetes and that number is projected to grow to 1 in 3 adults by 2050. The current treatment for high blood sugar is frequent self-administration of insulin injections and monitoring of blood sugar levels throughout the day is necessary to sustain life for patients with type 1 or advanced type 2 diabetes. Lack of tight control of blood sugar levels accounts for many chronic complications of diabetes, such as limb amputation, blindness and kidney failure; while low blood sugar levels result in life disruption and the risk of seizures, unconsciousness, brain damage, or possible death. Current insulin infusion approaches, however, cannot mimic normal physiological conditions in which the pancreatic cells quickly releases insulin in response to increase in blood sugar levels, and insulin levels are shut down once the blood sugar is normal. This proposal is to develop the next-generation blood glucose-responsive insulin delivery systems that are based on synthetic vesicles in a biomimetic manner, inspired by the vesicles (or granules) of pancreatic celIs. The planned insulin delivery system will be able to automatically regulate insulin release continuously and repeatedly according to blood sugar levels. Towards this goal, the PI proposes to develop transformative glucose-responsive insulin nanoparticles (GRINs) for intelligently regulating blood sugar levels with fast and repeatable responsiveness. The activation of GRINs and subsequent release of insulin are expected to be triggered at a high blood sugar level, and the release is inhibited with a normal blood sugar range, thereby mimicking pancreatic cells to ""secrete"" insulin in response to fluctuating blood sugar levels. The GRINs prepared will be further loaded into a painless microneedle array-based patch on the skin to achieve easy administration and enhanced biocompatibility. This project will develop novel materials, formulations and devices that may be of broad use for development of other bio-responsive smart drug delivery systems. In addition, the proposed research will create dynamic and sustainable education activities, including a K-12 based outreach module 'Engineering Our Way to Stop Diabetes', an interdisciplinary curriculum targeting undergraduates and graduates, together with hands-on lab research. Such activities are expected to inspire students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.


Technical: 
Diabetes is a major public health problem currently affecting about 422 million people across the world, and this number is expected to reach over 450 million by 2030. Current treatment for Type 1 and advanced Type 2 diabetic patients requires continuous monitoring of blood glucose (BG) levels and periodical insulin injections to maintain normal blood glucose levels. An artificial pancreas-like closed-loop insulin delivery system that continuously and intelligently releases insulin in response to changing blood glucose levels holds great promise for enhancing heath and improving quality of life for patients with type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes. To date, mimicking the function of pancreatic cells, chemically-controlled closed-loop delivery strategy utilizing synthetic materials and/or modified insulin have been widely explored. This typically consisted of polymeric formulations that swell, shrink or dissociate to adjust the insulin release rate according to ambient glucose levels. However, challenges remain to demonstrate a system which would combine; i) fast response; ii) repeatable activation; iii) ease of administration; and iv) excellent biocompatibility. The proposed project aims to develop the next-generation glucose-responsive insulin delivery systems, inspired by the ""natural"" granules of pancreatic cells. The PI will explore 'artificial' glucose-responsive insulin nano-granules (GRINs) and their relevant devices. The activation of GRINs and subsequent release of insulin are expected to be rapidly triggered at high blood sugar state, and inhibited within a normal blood sugar levels in a repeatable manner. The GRINs developed will be further integrated into a painless microneedle array-based device for application on skin, and thus achieving easy administration and enhanced biocompatibility. This project will also guide the development of novel materials, formulations and devices for engineering other delivery systems which can be intelligently activated by the variation of physiological signals. Moreover, the proposed research program will be closely integrated with dynamic and sustainable educational activities, through development of a K-12 outreach module- 'Engineering Our Way to Stop Diabetes', a new interdisciplinary curriculum targeting undergraduates and graduates, as well as hands-on lab research. Students will be exposed to biomaterials, devices and micro-nanotechnology, inspiring them to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.","Los Angeles","University of California-Los Angeles","47.049","201889","BIOMATERIALS PROGRAM","1919285","guzhen@ucla.edu","Zhen","Gu","02/11/2019","09/01/2018","06/30/2021","Engineering Biomimetic Glucose-Responsive Vesicles for Self-Regulated Insulin Delivery","BIO"
"Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are chemicals that contain multiple carbon-fluorine bonds. Due to their useful oil- and water-repellent properties, PFAS are used in many consumer products, industrial processes, and in firefighting foams. These uses have led to their release to the environment through multiple pathways. The carbon-fluorine bonds in PFAS make them extremely durable, so they do not naturally break down in the environment. Conventional drinking water treatment is not effective at removing most PFAS from water. This is of particular concern because some PFAS are known to cause harm. They can build up in the bodies of humans and wildlife, disrupt normal development, and impair the immune system. Yet no reliable information is available about the properties and health impacts of most PFAS. Recent estimates suggest that more than 4000 different PFAS may have been used and released over time. Detailed toxicity testing data are available for only a handful of these. It is therefore critical that we build our knowledge base regarding the potential impacts of PFAS and identify effective ways of removing them from the environment. The goal of this CAREER proposal is to tackle the enormous challenge posed by PFAS through an innovative complementary approach using predictive modeling and experiments. The results of this study will transform our understanding of PFAS behavior with broad benefits to society through better design of products to reduce environmental impacts at greatly reduced cost. 

The objectives of this CAREER proposal are threefold: (1) to use molecular and organism-scale models to conduct large-scale predictive screening of PFAS hazard; (2) to use this new knowledge of structure-interaction relationships to design new bio-inspired sorbents to remove PFAS from water; and (3) to reimagine K-12 and undergraduate education through the use of collaborative model-building in a game-like environment. An experimental, chemical-by-chemical approach to building a comprehensive PFAS knowledge base would be extremely costly in terms of time, laboratory animals, and resources needed. This would delay action in preventing the release of potentially harmful chemicals that could persist indefinitely in the environment without active treatment. By leveraging the power of molecular dynamics to rank the strength of PFAS-biomolecule interactions, coupled to organism-scale physiological models, those PFAS most likely to accumulate in specific tissues or elicit a receptor-specific toxic impact can be rapidly identified. Further, strong interactions with particular biological molecules can be used to design an entirely novel class of selective sorbents. This capitalizes on the very property that makes PFAS hazardous (their tendency to bind to biological macromolecules like proteins) to remove them from water in an efficient and targeted way. Moreover, the broad structural knowledge base that will be created during this CAREER program can be leveraged to 'design out' hazardous properties in future chemicals. Throughout this research program, the power of modeling and simulation will engage and inspire thousands of middle and high school students and their teachers through both formal educational programs and informal STEM outreach, and will be used to enhance systems-level thinking and self-confidence among undergraduates, thereby enhancing the recruitment and retention of diverse cohorts of future STEM leaders.

"The Beaufort Gyre (BG) is a unique circulation component within the Arctic Ocean's physical environmental system reflecting a set of specific atmospheric, sea-ice, oceanic and bio-geo-ecological conditions that have significant interrelationships with the Arctic-wide and global climate system. One of the most striking Arctic observations in the 21st century has been a reduction in both sea-ice extent and thickness, and an increase of freshwater content in the BG region. At present, there are insufficient observations or theories to reach a consensus among the different opinions about these changes and their impact on climate. The BG summer freshwater content has increased by 6,600 km3 since 2003. Not only does this have important consequences for Arctic sea-ice, ocean thermodynamics, and ecosystems, but a possible fresh water release from the Arctic of this magnitude is enough to cause a salinity anomaly in the North Atlantic with a magnitude comparable to the Great Salinity Anomaly of the 1970s, which could influence global climate by reducing the ocean meridional overturning circulation and result in cooling. Thus, the BG system is a potential source to force significant climate changes, likely at decadal time scales. Data returned from this project and distributed freely via the project website and archived with the NSF Arctic Data Center will continue to advance our understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological drivers of environmental change in the Arctic, their relationship to the climate system, and linkages to global processes. Long-term time series of project data will facilitate numerical model initialization and validation and stimulate general interest in Arctic science issues. The knowledge gained under this project will continue to be vital to a wide variety of Arctic processes and climate studies, to operational forecasting and other Arctic research programs, and will spur further valuable investigations of the Arctic Ocean. This project will continue to expand international cooperation and promote widespread access to Arctic for both researchers and the general public. Educational activities will include training of graduate students providing them the opportunity to participate in BG cruises and advising them in BG data analysis. The project data will continue to be used by the Forum for Arctic Modeling and Observational Synthesis (FAMOS) project and Arctic community to validate and improve Arctic regional and global models, test hypotheses, and answer scientific questions.

The Beaufort Gyre Observing System (BGOS) will be continued throughout 2019-2020 to observe a set of environmental parameters using bottom-anchored moorings and shipboard measurements to continue the long-term time-series at standard locations. Ship-based synoptic sampling covering the entire BG will continue to be performed each summer in collaboration with Canadian scientists to observe reversal of the climatic circulation regime that has been persistent in one sense over the observation period. Temperature, salinity, oxygen, nutrients, barium, CFCs and carbon tetrachloride, alkalinity, total CO2, dissolved inorganic carbon, tritium/3-He and delta-O-18 will continue to be measured and analyzed along sections at 140W, 150W, ~75N and ~78N using a shipboard CTD/rosette. Between CTD/rosette casts, expendable CTDs that profile to 1100m depth will continue to be used to increase spatial resolution of the temperature and salinity fields. Three BGOS moorings redeployed in 2018 will acquire precise data on the variations of the vertical distribution of seawater properties, bottom pressures, and sea ice draft at the same scientifically important sites within the BG system and will be retrieved in 2020.

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will benefit manufacturers of residual gas analyzers, mass spectrometers, ion-mobility spectrometers, time-of-flight spectrometers and related instruments. Implementation of these sensors will increase the revenue, revenue streams and market share of commercial manufacturers of mass spectrometers by significantly lowering production cost, and by enabling penetration into new markets that require increased sensitivity, lowered size, weight, power consumption, and instrument complexity. The product, if successful, will lead to analytical tools that can substantially benefit the needs of education/research, space, bio/health, agricultural, defense and security markets.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop nanotechnology-based chip-scale ion sensors with ultra-high intrinsic charge-to-current amplification factors. This patent-pending technology allows semiconductor-processable miniaturization and scalability, sub-microwatt intrinsic power draw, and robust ambient-pressure-agnostic operation. With reduced size, weight, and power requirements, increased sensitivity and dynamic range, these sensors can potentially replace expensive, bulky, and/or high-power-consuming charged particle detectors such as microchannel plates, Daly detectors, electron-multiplier tubes and Faraday cups. The ability to operate under any ambient pressure and distinguish charge polarity can significantly enhance field-portability, turnkey operations, and enhance analytical reach of ion-sensing-based applications. Specifically, the proposed research will seek to overcome the challenges related to generation of high signal responses (by enhancing the electronic transport parameters), high ion-sensor interaction (by optimizing sensor design), and lower readout noise (by optimizing materials and design).

"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a safe, natural, long-lasting and effective mosquito repellent product by exploiting the natural repellent compounds present in the skin microbiome.  Mosquito-borne illnesses affect 700M people worldwide and cause several million deaths each year.  Chikungunya, West Nile, Malaria, Zika, Dengue, are just some of the debilitating vectors spread by mosquitoes. Mosquito-derived diseases cost >$6.8B/year and the market for mosquito repellents is >$3.2B and growing. Many solutions are aimed at killing and disabling mosquitoes, but mosquitoes are a crucial part of the ecological food chain. Further, many repellents are extremely toxic, and mosquitoes are developing resistance. The proposed technology will be used to identify compounds that will drive the endogenous skin microbiome to a more mosquito repellent phenotype. Using these methods, it is possible to harness the biochemistry contained in the native skin microbiome to create an endogenous repellency that is a safe, natural, environmentally friendly, and effective barrier to mosquitoes. It is expected that this repellency approach may be used safely even with children and pregnant women. In addition, it may be possible to use this approach to develop repellents for multiple insects, repellent products for companion animals, and additional over-the-counter skin products.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a new class of topical insect repellents by influencing repellency in the skin microbiome.  This will be accomplished by developing and validating a platform technology to identify compounds produced by the microbiome that are associated with biochemical pathways of interest, and use the identified compounds to target those pathways whose end-products comprise natural mosquito-repellent compounds. The goal is to create a topical mosquito repellent product. For this project, the plan is to complete metagenome sequencing on skin samples collected from individuals that are either naturally repellent or attractive to Anopheles mosquitoes (the mosquito that carries Malaria). The next step is to predict metabolite compound turnover and use metabolomics to validate the results. In vitro assays and in silico models will be used to provide proof-of-concept for the use of those predicted compounds to induce the microbiota to produce mosquito repellent metabolites.

"The flapping of wings is a common locomotion technique for tiny animals in both air and water. Insects flap their wings to fly in air, and zooplanktonic marine snails called sea butterflies flap wing-like appendages (called parapodia) to ""fly"" in water. Further, some tiny insect species are able to locomote via wing flapping in both air and water. Despite the thousand-fold difference in density between air and water, the flight systems of these very different animals show surprising similarities in how the wings move and in how they generate lift. These similarities point towards the possibility of designing a bio-inspired micro-aerial vehicle capable of aerial and aquatic flapping flight, but the fluid dynamics of such flight systems are not well understood. The aim of this project is to investigate the fluid dynamics of small-scale biological flapping systems flying in air, in water, and in both. This research will occur within the larger context of an education program in which underrepresented engineering students prepare for graduate studies by learning research skills, creating an illustrated children's book about sea butterflies, and attending a graduate class field trip.

Tiny insects and sea butterflies (pteropods) use similar wing kinematics and lift generation techniques to propel themselves in air and water, respectively. Further, some insects use their wings for both aerial flight and aquatic swimming. However, neither the fluid dynamics of aerial and aquatic flapping locomotion at low Reynolds numbers nor the adaptations these animals have made to fly in air, water, or both are well understood. This project will experimentally investigate these adaptations and the underlying fluid physics of flapping flight in air, water, and both by a diverse group of insects and pteropod species, with the following outcomes: 1) High speed kinematics and volumetric flow measurements of swimming pteropods will show how extreme wing flexibility affects lift production. 2) A novel, ultra-high-speed particle image velocimetry system will provide measurements of the 3D kinematics used by and the flow generated by freely flying tiny insects. 3) Kinematics and flow measurements of the swimming and flying of tiny aquatic insects will reveal how an aerial flight system can be adapted to aquatic operation. These outcomes will illuminate the core fluid dynamics principles underlying this locomotion technique, build understanding of the adaptations animals have made for flapping locomotion in air and water, and inspire design strategies for multimodal micro-aerial vehicles.

"The invention of the Atomic Force Microscope and Optical Traps about 30 years ago started a revolution in many branches of science by realizing an unprecedented possibility to visualize and mechanically manipulate individual molecules under ambient conditions including water, which is critical for most studies involving bio-molecules and living cells. These inventions created a new and rapidly growing field of single-molecule force spectroscopy that over the years has produced many seminal discoveries about how biological macromolecules respond to mechanical forces and how external forces may alter the course of biochemical reactions. Thus, a review of these major accomplishments, as well as identifying most promising new research objectives while discussing current methodological limitations and weaknesses in the form of a scientific workshop is long overdue. The purpose of this conference is to bring together about 40-50 participants including leading force spectroscopy experts. The organizers plan to include as participants postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students to collectively work on needed methodological improvements and to identify the most promising and exciting research opportunities and to initiate collaborative endeavors in the single-molecule force spectroscopy field.  

This workshop will put strong emphasis on the synergy between multiple single molecule experimental and computational techniques.  In addition to the comprehensive discussions of variety of single molecule experimental techniques and current roadblocks, the workshop will also emphasize on prospects of measurements in situ and in vivo for all the techniques. The workshop will include two round table discussions on technical aspects of the methodologies that involve discussion of current attachments methods to surfaces and sensors as well as discussion of resolution limits, precision of measurements and fore sensor fabrication and calibration issues.  This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics.

"The science of forecasting where a species can live and how it responds to climate change is still in its infancy. A species' geographic range is the map of where a species can be found. It is fundamental to understanding species' ecology and evolution and increasingly plays a vital role in conservation. Collections of species ranges covering most of the 30,000 terrestrial vertebrate species are already available for scientific analysis. However, collections of species ranges from the other ~95% of species on the planet are rare. The time is ripe to change this. New access to vast quantities of data from biological inventories, museums, citizen science, and previously funded studies mean that adequate data are available to estimate the ranges of many more species. However, we are currently missing robust forecasting methods and the computational tools to produce large numbers of ranges. This project will develop the novel computational methods and algorithms needed to forecast the current state and future fate of the many thousands of poorly studied species ranges. These methods will be applied to forecast how 100,000+ plant species in the New World will respond to climate change. The researchers will test key assumptions in conservation biology about how species respond to changing climate and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots across North and South America have/will change over time.  The end result of their work will be a novel tool for the ecological community that has tremendous potential to guide biological sampling strategies, particularly in conservation and citizen science applications. 

The proposed research will examine whether biodiversity hotspots are constant through time and whether species climatic niches are phylogenetically conserved, two implicit assumptions with wide-reaching implications in conservation biology and basic ecology. This research will develop a workflow to predict species ranges for any taxonomic group using by combining occurrence data with GIS data. This workflow will be applied to all New World plants to study basic questions, such as how species richness varies across space and time (a topic studied almost exclusively in vertebrates and trees). Computationally, the project will address core challenges in data scrubbing, niche modeling practices, novel niche modeling methods, and mega-phylogeny analysis methods.  A freely available generic pipeline will be capable of linking biodiversity occurrence data to species ranges and scaling these computations to 1000s or 100,000s of species. This integrated pipeline will be implemented by: 1) appropriately scrubbing data to remove taxonomic and geographic errors, 2) identifying clear best practice methods for range modeling applicable across diverse species, 3) innovating range modeling methods that integrate diverse data such as presence only museum collections and abundance-based plot data 4) scaling computationally-intensive range modeling in an HPC environment, and 5) placing the outputs of the products in a phylogenetic context. This project will develop such a pipeline using a novel database of 20,000,000 observations of 100,000+ species of plants in the New World. The range forecasts produced will be used to test key assumptions in conservation biology about the phylogenetic conservatism of species climatic niches and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots over time. This research will make substantial contributions to scientific infrastructure through the development of a scientific codebase for the production of high-quality species ranges from primary biodiversity data.

"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program project will: (i) generate new decision theories and models to help government policymakers in crafting the incentives to advance public-private enterprise capital formation and investments into electricity infrastructure systems; and (ii) investigate and provide self-organized restoration plans in the advent of a disruption. Inspired by the self-healing properties in biological systems such as morphogenesis (genes adapting to environmental changes) and wound healing (functional changes in cells due to regeneration), this CAREER project will expand the paradigms of complex adaptive systems by incorporating realism and empirical data into models that have practical implications such as how much to invest in a particular electricity technology portfolio in order to enhance system resilience. In addition to creating new decision theories in incentivizing players in the electricity market, one outcome will be a decision support platform for policymaking to enhance public-private enterprise participation in community resilience efforts. To integrate the research components into educational activities, this project will: (i) incorporate social innovation and entrepreneurship to reach students at all levels; (ii) create a hierarchical makerspace academy to provide high school and STEM students the knowledge to build empirical and analytical models of decision making by including project tasks in formal and informal learning processes; and (iii) integrate methods from economics, operations research, and biology with engineering knowledge. The multi-disciplinary approach will help broaden participation of underrepresented minorities in research and positively impact engineering education.

This research is at the nexus of predictive analytics used to forecast electric power disruptions and robust stochastic optimization models used to determine investments into energy technology portfolios under sequential and multiple uncertainties in policy and technological performance. This project will integrate these approaches in a bio-inspired complex adaptive system framework to evaluate performance-oriented dynamic investments, and use scenario analysis to distill the thresholds of resilience-enhancing electricity technology portfolios. The PI will interpret the system healing process to be a dynamic function of infrastructural decay, operating status/environment, adaptation, redundancy, and the potential for assets decentralization to limit disaster propensity for damage propagation and downtime protraction. This framework will employ the multiple Taylor Series function with wide area measurement system data for system stability prediction within a modified IEEE bus test system. This project will evaluate the value of a resilient infrastructure system in the larger scheme of systems interdependence with the aid of Integrated Assessment Models such as Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models infused with mathematical representations of physical system degradation. If successful, this CAREER project will provide the first scientific test of the efficacy of the multi-disciplinary approach.

"This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will advance the national health, welfare, and security through scientific advancements in the field of biologically-inspired robotics favorable for wearable technology and exoskeletons. The research will make important contributions to society by increasing robot energy efficiency and performance while simultaneously improving human-robot interaction compatibility and safety through the use of inherently soft actuators. Actuators are critical component of a machine or robot that are responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or components of a system. Current robotic actuators are poorly suited to wearable or human-assistive applications because they are inefficient when used in slow, variable-speed motions like moving an arm or leg. In addition, they create human safety hazards due to their stiffness and rigid motions. This research will create a new type of actuator that is inspired by human muscle tissues, which contain thousands of fibers that are selectively recruited to provide only the amount of force needed for a given task. Engineering artificial muscles to incorporate this concept of selective recruitment will allow the robot to consume less energy, therefore increasing battery life and range. It will also allow the same actuator to generate both gentle, precise motion as well as high-force, high-speed motion, depending on the task, while also incorporating soft construction and controllable stiffness. This new approach will help make assistive robotics safer, more comfortable, and more compatible with human physiology, all of which will provide more rapid and effective recovery for those suffering from debilitating injuries or disabilities. This research lends itself well to outreach opportunities to work with young people who suffer from disabilities; the outreach activities will help inspire them and show them how engineering can be used to improve their lives and the lives of those around them.

Improvements in actuator efficiency and performance can be made by implementing the biologically-inspired concept of orderly recruitment to create an integrated fluidic artificial muscle tissue that contains selectable actuation elements of different sizes. This tissue can dynamically adapt to changes in load by recruiting different combinations of actuators. This orderly recruitment scheme conserves energy by reducing working fluid consumption and minimizing throttling losses. It also allows for a wide gamut of force generation and fast response time due to reduced flow rate demand. The goals of this research are to (1) understand the relationships between recruitment state, pressure, force, contraction, and velocity for selective-recruitment fluidic artificial muscle tissues; (2) establish the effects of topology on performance and create a framework for optimizing tissues to robot operating tasks and requirements; (3) understand implications of recruitment control architecture; and (4) demonstrate bandwidth improvements, variable compliance, and energetic savings on a walking robot platform.

"This REU Site award to the University of Maine, located in Orono, ME, will support the training 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2019-2021.  The REU Site theme implements convergent thinking to solve complex, interdependent problems in human, animal and environmental health (One Health). Faculty mentors represent the Schools of Food and Agriculture, Marine Sciences, Biology and Ecology, Wildlife, Forestry, Economics and Climate Change. REU students conduct research on topics such as ecology/health of wild animals (e.g. wild turkey, moose, seals) in relationship to livestock/human health and explore relevant environmental policy. REU students also participate in workshops on mentor-mentee relationships, goal-setting, research design/ethics; data collection, analysis and interpretation; and communication and collaborative problem solving skills. Students present their results at an annual One Health symposium. The REU will strive to enroll at least 50% under-represented students in STEM (African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders), veterans, and early-career (freshmen to juniors, community college) or first-generation college students. Students apply online and applications are immediately reviewed by the leadership team, with mentor assignment and discussion of project topic prior to program start.

It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program.  Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present results of their work at scientific conferences. Each student will be paired with a secondary broader impacts mentor, who will share the relevance of One Health research to ?real world? problems and foster career options in their field.

A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.

"This SBIR Phase I project is developing a breakthrough technology to non-invasively monitor fetal oxygen levels in utero, to enable the more accurately detection of fetuses in distress and facilitate safer births for mothers and babies. Currently, obstetricians struggle with a 50-year old monitoring technology, which reports fetal heart rate and maternal contractions, and that is associated with an 89% false positive rate for detecting babies in distress. This is a major contributor to high cesarean section rates worldwide and up to 40% in some US hospitals. Because of the costs, risks for mothers and negative implications for babies' health, C-section rates are coming under scrutiny from insurers and accreditors, however, clinicians lack the means to accurately identify oxygenation starvation and, to date, no non-invasive means of directly measuring fetal oxygenation has been developed. Raydiant's system builds off traditional pulse oximetry and will employ safe levels of light, through the mother's abdomen, to monitor fetal pulse and report oxygen saturation, the crucial, but missing diagnostic. This technology will be applicable to over 2.9 million births per year in the US as an enhancement to traditional monitoring whenever a heart rate signal of concern is observed. Both the absolute oxygenation value and its trend over time will enable more informed decision making throughout the birth process.

This project pushes the fundamental boundaries of pulse oximetry and bio-photonics. Unlike traditional finger pulse oximetry, sensing non-invasively through the maternal abdomen presents a body in a body problem, where the fetal pulse signal is orders of magnitude weaker than and intertwined with the maternal. Photons are scattered and absorbed by multiple tissue layers and there are tradeoffs between signal strength, noise and the ratio of fetal to maternal signal. Non-homogeneities from subject to subject makes calibration difficult. Addressing these challenges will require innovation in photonics hardware and signal processing and this proposal has a three specific aims: the development of a specific sensor hardware architecture that will facilitate detection of the fetal signal; development of Raydiant's algorithm to separate fetal from maternal signal, reject noise and report saturation; and validation of the combined system in a pregnant animal model, where fetal oxygenation levels are actively controlled and compared to the device reading. This proposal encompasses developing a second generation prototype system and represents critical technology de-risking aiming towards a commercial system for integration with current monitoring technology and clinical practice.

"This SBIR Phase I project will advance novel techniques for developing high-resolution noninvasive brain imaging systems, capable of recording unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution inferences of the brain activity for a portable system.  These systems leverage novel fundamental analysis and results, and experimental demonstrations, that show that spatial resolution of Electroencephalography (EEG) is not saturated at densities of a few hundred electrodes, unlike what has been widely believed in clinical and neuroscience community.  They also build on recent work by the PIs that enables faster and reliable acquisition of EEG signals. The success of the proposed work will help diagnose worsening brain injuries before the injury occurs. Brain injuries affect 1.7 million Americans every year. Commercially, it will enable higher resolution brain-machine interfaces for applications such as virtual reality interfacing and neuroprostheses, generating novel avenues for jobs and revenue through creation of an entirely new industry.  This transdisciplinary effort brings together neuroscientists and engineers and the concepts developed in this effort will inform material for basic neuroscience and neuroengineering courses.  The team will continue to publish and publicize their work at clinical conferences.  One of the core employees will be a minority female who has contributed to the research, guided several other minority (and non-minority) female students, and now wants to lead the development end of this project.

This effort builds a systematic platform that challenges the widely held belief that increasing electrode-densities of EEG to beyond a few hundred electrodes does not improve spatial resolution. There are several problems with the traditional EEG that the platform overcomes: (i) typically only 9-32 electrodes are used for clinical diagnoses and these are fundamentally limited to only providing poor spatial resolution; (ii) because traditional EEGs have low resolution, surgical treatments often require invasive procedures. E.g., for diagnosing severity or worsening of Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) by measuring parameters of cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs), which are mediators of worsening brain injuries; (iii) long-term EEG measurements are cumbersome, and high-density systems can take hours of manual labor to install. The PIs' preliminary work provides strong evidence supporting the claim that ultra-high-density EEG will provide the first non-invasive and portable modality for high spatial and temporal resolution brain imaging.  Novel brain-imaging algorithms will be developed and benchmarked against existing techniques and assessed using novel fundamental limits.  Novel techniques will be deployed in the design of conductive sponges and in lowering power, enabling the platform to be portable and usable over long term.  These improvements will be rigorously tested through simulations, experiments, and real data analysis.

"Tomography is a powerful technique that has found wide applications in life science and medical diagnosis. Optical tomography is particularly attractive since it is noninvasive and uses non-ionizing radiation. Recent development to optical tomography focuses on pushing the imaging depth, as motivated by many important needs including deep tissue imaging and brain photostimulations. However, existing optical tomography devices can only provide high-resolution imaging up to ~100 microns, limited by the single-scattering approximation. The goal of this CAREER program is to overcome this limitation by advancing both fundamental theory and practical devices. This program will establish novel multiple-scattering based tomography models that allow efficiently utilizing the information contained in the multiply scattered light.  A new type of optical devices based on the intensity diffraction tomography will be developed with simple experimental setups to facilitate easy adoption to existing microscope systems. The outcome of this program can enable scientific and biomedical discoveries by providing means to study biological samples and phenomena that would be otherwise not accessible, in areas such as histology, cytometry, brain mapping, and drug discovery. In addition, the research subject will be translated to a new ""Innovation in a Box"" hands-on curriculum and disseminated broadly to middle and high-school students through the Boston University Technology Innovation Scholars Program.  The education program will focus on raising both interest and knowledge of STEM subjects and providing multidisciplinary training to graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students with diverse background, in particular women, minorities, and historically under-represented groups.
Technical:
This CAREER program aims to develop novel optical imaging devices that fully utilize multiple scattering to enable high-resolution imaging in highly scattering media. Scattering in complex media is a fundamental subject that continuously attracts theoretical and experimental endeavors, since it impacts many important applications. To date, solving the inverse-scattering problem remains difficult due to the many degrees of freedom in multiple scattering, and incomplete information limited by the measurement condition. To overcome these limitations, this program will focus on (a) novel physical models and inverse multiple scattering algorithms in both transmission and reflection using intensity-only tomographic measurement; and (b) innovative spatial coherence and multispectral illumination engineering solutions. The anticipated outcomes include: i) new multiple scattering-based theory, algorithms, and devices that can lead to high-resolution 3D imaging of highly scattering objects; ii) theoretical and experimental advancement to 3D phase retrieval in both transmission and reflection tomography; iii) new device design principles for adaptive coherence engineering to harness the multiple scattering information. Broadly, the program will establish fundamentally new understandings of label-free, scatter-based imaging and develop new generation of computational imaging sensors and devices by jointly designing optics and algorithms to break the conventional limits.

"With support from the Biosensing Program in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems Division, and partial co-funding from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Mingxu You and his research team at the University of Massachusetts Amherst are streamlining a generalized approach for imaging small molecules in living cells.  Revolutionary fluorescent biosensing probes have been engineered for the live-cell imaging of proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules.  The outcome of this project will provide ground-breaking methodologies in the field of live-cell imaging of small molecules.  The proposed project will allow researchers from the life sciences, engineering, and physical sciences to measure cellular levels and dynamics of a wide range of analytes with readily accessible sensors.  This project will also integrate sensor engineering research with scientific education and outreach.  

In this project, a new generalized sensor system is developed by integrating emerging fluorogenic RNA aptamers, a systematic evolution approach, and natural RNA machineries with nucleic acid nanotechnology.  Fluorogenic RNA aptamers, such as so-called ""Spinach"" and ""Broccoli"",  serve as the genetically encoded fluorescent reporters.  Systematic evolution is used to screen for aptamers that can selectively bind with target small molecules inside live cells.  Finally, RNA devices and circuits existing in nature or enabled by nanotechnology provides signal amplification as well as scaffolds for the ratiometric and multiplexed imaging and quantification of target analytes.  The major research objectives are: (1) to develop quantitative RNA sensors with multiplexing ability for the cellular imaging of small-molecule levels; (2) to engineer sensitive and robust RNA circuits and devices for detecting low-abundance analytes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells; and (3) to generate a high-throughput screening platform to rapidly evolve functional RNA sensors directly in a cellular milieu.  Overall, RNA-based fluorescent probes will be radically advanced through this project for quantitative imaging of a wide range of small-molecule analytes in living cells. Dr. You is an active faculty participant in the Eureka! Program of Girls Inc. of Holyoke, and will continue to provide summer research opportunities for female middle school students in this program.  The You research team will also provide lab tours for local middle school students and teachers.  In addition, this project provides training opportunities for the next-generation of U.S. trained scientists.  Undergraduate and graduate students involved in this project will gain experience in bioengineering, analytical chemistry, and chemical biology.  Based on the proposed sensor design principles, Dr. You will assemble and mentor a team of UMass Amherst undergrads for the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition.
